to miss M— B. 

no more sorrow, no more care,
 tune my lyre to cheerful air. 
now so happy, now so gay,
 it be for — this my lay. 
while the nymph with pleasure twine,
 with each flower that deck the spring,
 the gay garland for the brow,
 few among they sweet as you;
 may the nymph for he design,
 ever faithful, ever kind;
 sweet and cheerful, may she be;
 temper and good sense like thou.
