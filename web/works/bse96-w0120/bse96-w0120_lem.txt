sonnet.

if he who bosom with no transport swell
 in vernal air, and hour, commit the crime
 of sullenness to nature; against the time,
 and its great ruler, he alike rebel
 who seriousness, and pious dread repel,
 and aweless gaze on the fade clime,
 dim in the gloom, and pale in the hoar rhyme,
 that over the bleak, and dreary prospect steal. 
spring claim our tender, grateful, gay delight;
 winter our sympathy, and sacred fear;
 and sure the heart that pay not pity rite
 over wide calamity, — that careless hear
 creation wail, — neglect, amid her blight,
 the solemn lesson of the ruin year.
