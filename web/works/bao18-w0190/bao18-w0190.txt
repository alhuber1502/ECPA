TO HENRY.

HOW I hail this morn's appearing! 
It will thee, my love, restore:
 Safety danger past endearing,
 Sure we meet to part no more! 

Fame is thine, lo! crowds aver it,
 And her smile is dear to thee;
 But I charge thee, don't prefer it
 E'er again to home and me. 

Thou, thy country's call obeying,
 Hast her battles nobly fought;
 And, thy ready zeal repaying,
 See, she gives the laurels sought. 

But have I no claims, my rover? 
Claims as fondly dear to thee? 
Yes, O yes! and, wandering over,
 Thou wilt rest with love and me. 

Ha! methinks, thy glances reading,
 From thine eyes my fate I know;
 Duty still love's claim impeding,
 Thou again must seek the foe. 

Of my fears too dread revival! 
Yet, with tearful joy I see,
 Duty is the only rival
 Potent over love and me.
