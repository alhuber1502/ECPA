to mr. William blackbourn. 

life fly too fast to be waste.

i 

mark, how it snow! how fast the valley fill? 
and the sweet groves the hoary garment wear;
 yet the warm sunbeam bound from the hill
 shall melt the Vail away, and the young green appear. 

ii.

but when old age have drop upon your head
 her silver frost, there be no return sun;
 swift roll our autumn, swift our summer flee,
 when youth, and love, and spring, and golden joy be go. 

iii.

then cold, and winter, and your age snow
 stick fast upon you; not the rich array,
 nor the green garland, nor the rosy bough
 shall cancel or conceal the melancholy grey. 

iv.

the chase of pleasure be not worth the pain,
 while the bright sand of health run waste down,
 and honour call you from the soft scene
 to sell the gaudy hour for age of renown. 

v. 

it be but one youth and short that we can have,
 and one old age dissolve our feeble frame;
 but there be a heavenly art to elude the grave,
 and with the heroe-race immortal kindred claim. 

vi.

the man that have his country sacred tear
 to drop upon his Herse, have live his day:
 thus, blackbourn, we shall leave our name our heir;
 old time and wane moon sweep all the rest away.
