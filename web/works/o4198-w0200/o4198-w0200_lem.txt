the Methodist.

may 1770. 

say Tom to jack, it be very odd,
 these representative of god,
 in colour, way of life and evil,
 shall be so very like the devil. 
jack, understand, be one of those,
 who mould religion in the nose,
 a red hot Methodist; his face
 be full of puritanic grace,
 his loose lank hair, his slow gradation,
 declare a late regeneration;
 among the daughter long renowned,
 for stand upon holy ground;
 never in carnal battle beat,
 though sometime force to a retreat. 
but câ€”t, hero as he be,
 knight of incomparable phiz,
 when pliant doxy seem to yield,
 courageous forsake the field. 
jack, or to write more grave, John
 through hill of Wesley work have go;
 can sing one hundred hymn by rote;
 hymn which will sanctify the throat:
 but some indeed compose so odd,
 you will swear it be bawdy song make godly.
