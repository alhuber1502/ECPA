a proud lover farewell to his mistress.

farewell, thou haughty, cruel fair! 
upon thy brow no long wear
 that somber look of cold disdain,
 i never shall see thy face again. 
now every foolish wish be over,
 and fear and doubting be not more. 

all cruel as thou be to i,
 long have my heart be fix on thou. 
i have track thy footstep over the green,
 and share thy ramble oft unseen;
 i have linger near thou night and day
 when thou have think i far away;
 i have watch the change of thy face,
 and fond mark thy move grace;
 i have weep with joy thy smile to see;
 i have be a fool for love of thou. 
yet do not think i stay the while
 thy feeble pity to beguile:
 let favour force still fruitless prove! 
the pity curse that bring not love! 

no woman ever shall give i pain
 or ever break my rest again:
 nor aught that come of womankind
 again have power to move my mind. 
far on a foreign shore i will seek
 some lonely island bare and bleak;
 there find some wild and rugged cell,
 and with the untamed creature dwell. 
to hear their cry be now my choice,
 rather than man deceitful voice;
 to hear the tempest boisterous song
 than woman soft witch tongue:
 they wear no guise, nor promise good,
 but roughsome seem as they be rude. 

o Phillis! thou have wreck a heart
 that proud bear, but feel the smart. 
adieu, adieu! shall thou ever prove
 the pang of ill requite love,
 thou will know what i have bear for thou,
 and then thou will remember i.
