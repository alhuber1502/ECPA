on a wedding.

hark! hark! how the bell ring, how happy the day,
 now thirsis make Daphne his bride;
 see cheerful bird chirp on every green spray,
 and summer shine forth in its pride. 

the lad and the lass, so jocund and gay,
 their happiness hail with a song;
 and thirsis enchant pipe to their lay,
 inspire with mirth all the throng. 

the bride and the bride groom then join in the dance
 and smile trip nimble around;
 the sprightly gay bride's-maid as nimble advance,
 and answer their smile with a bound. 

with all marriage article pen on the heart,
 the party so sweet agree;
 they need no lawyer, with quibble art,
 or parchment to draw up a deed. 

for love, the first blessing of blessing below,
 that heaven to mortal can give,
 be all the kind shepherdess have to bestow,
 and all that she wish to receive.
