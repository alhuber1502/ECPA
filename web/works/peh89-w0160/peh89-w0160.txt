On a WEDDING.

Hark! hark! how the bells ring, how happy the day,
 Now Thirsis makes Daphne his bride;
 See cheerful birds chirping on ev'ry green spray,
 And summer shines forth in its pride. 

The lads and the lasses, so jocund and gay,
 Their happiness hail with a song;
 And Thirsis enchantingly pipes to their lay,
 Inspiring with mirth all the throng. 

The bride and the bride groom then join in the dance
 And smiling trip nimbly around;
 The sprightly gay bride's-maids as nimbly advance,
 And answer their smiles with a bound. 

With all marriage articles pen'd on the heart,
 The parties so sweetly agreed;
 They needed no lawyer, with quibbling art,
 Or parchment to draw up a deed. 

For Love, the first blessing of blessings below,
 That Heaven to mortals can give,
 Was all the kind shepherdess had to bestow,
 And all that she wish'd to receive.
