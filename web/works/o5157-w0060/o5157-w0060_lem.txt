hail sacred stream, who water roll
immortal through the classic page!
to thou the muse-devoted soul,
though destine to a late age
and less indulgent clime, to thou,
nor thou disdain, in runic lay
weak mimic of true harmony,
his grateful homage pay.
far other strain thy elder ear
with please attention wont to hear,
when he, who string the latian lyre,
and he, who lead the aonian choir
from mantua reedy lake with osier crown,
teach echo from thy bank with transport to resound.
thy bank? â€” alas, be this the boast scene,
this dreary, wide, uncultivated plain,
where sicken nature wear a faint green,
and desolation spread her torpid reign?
in this the scene where freedom breathe,
her copious horn where plenty wreathe,
and health at open day
bid all her roseate breeze fly,
to wake the son of industry,
and make their field more gay?

ii.

where be the villa rural pride,
the swell dome imperial gleam,
which love to grace thy verdant side,
and tremble in thy golden stream?
where be the bold, the busy throng,
that rush impatient to the war,
or tune to peace triumphal song,
and hail the pass car?
along the solitary road,
the eternal flint by consul tread,
we muse, and mark the sad decay
of mighty work, and mighty day!
for these vile waste, we cry, have fate decree
that veii son shall strive, for these Camillus bleed?
do here, in aftertime of roman pride,
the muse shepherd from soracte height
see town extend wherever thy water glide,
and temple rise, and people farm unite?
they do. for this desert plain
the hero strive, nor strive in vain:
and here the shepherd see
unnumbered town and temple spread,
while Rome majestic rear her head,
and give the nation law.

iii.

yes, thou and Latium once be great.
and still, you first of human thing,
beyond the grasp of time or fate
her fame and thy triumphant spring.
what though the moulder column fall,
and strow the desert earth beneath,
though ivy round each nod wall
entwine its fatal wreath,
yet say, can Rhine or Danube boast
the numerous glory thou have lose?
can even euphrates palmy shore,
or Nile, with all his mystic lore,
produce from old record of genuine fame
such hero, poet, king, or emulate thy name?
even now the muse, the conscious muse be here;
from every ruin formidable shade
eternal music breathe on fancy ear,
and wake to more than form the illustrious dead.
thy caesar, Scipios, catos rise,
the great, the virtuous, and the wise,
in solemn state advance!
they fix the philosophic eye,
or trail the robe, or lift on high
the lightning of the lance.

iv.

but chief that humble happy train
who know those virtue to reward
beyond the reach of chance or pain
secure, the historian and the bard.
by they the hero generous rage
still warm in youth immortal life;
and in their adamantine page
thy glory still survive.
through deep savannah wild and vast,
unheard, unknown through age past,
beneath the sun directer beam
what copious torrent pour their stream!
no fame have they, no fond pretence to mourn,
no annal swell their pride, or grace their story urn.
while thou, with Rome exalt genius join,
her spear yet lift, and her corslet brace,
can tell the wave, can tell the pass wind
thy wondrous tale, and cheer the listen waste.
though from his cave the unfeeling north
pour all his legion tempest forth,
yet still thy laurel bloom:
one deathless glory still remain,
thy stream have roll through latian plain,
have wash the wall of Rome.
