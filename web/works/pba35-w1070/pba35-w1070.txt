Verses occasion'd by the Sickness of Mrs. Anne Donnellan.

I

Goddess of Health, where-e'er you dwell,
 To Philomela fly;
 O hasten from your rural Cell,
 Nor let the Fair one die. 

II

Again her Voice divine restore,
 And give her Eyes their Fire;
 So shall a World thy Pow'r adore,
 And raise thy Altars higher.
