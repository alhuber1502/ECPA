verse occasion by the sickness of mrs. Anne Donnellan.

i

goddess of health, wherever you dwell,
 to Philomela fly;
 o hasten from your rural cell,
 nor let the fair one die. 

ii

again her voice divine restore,
 and give her eye their fire;
 so shall a world thy power adore,
 and raise thy altar high.
