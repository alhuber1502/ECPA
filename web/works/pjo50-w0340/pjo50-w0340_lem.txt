to the prince of orange, on his marriage.

write at the time of the OXFORD verse.

to foreign note while other tune the lyre,
 i let a free-born english muse inspire:
 unskilled in all the grace of her art,
 she boast of nothing but a honest heart;
 to oxford son resign the verdant bay,
 and neither ask, nor yet despise praise. 

patron of freedom, and their country be peace,
 inure to danger, and despise ease —
 such be the illustrious hero of thy race! 
such be Nassau! and we with pleasure see
 our guardian genius rise again in thou. 
thou Britain hail, and with a generous pride
 behold thy virtue to her throne ally. 
auspicious match! — may heaven indulgent shed
 its choice blessing round the genial bed! 

hail wed love! perpetual source of peace;
 the calm, where restless passion sink to ease. 
when heart unite thus each other claim,
 how sweet the friendship! and how soft the flame! 
wealth, honour, empire far behind be throw,
 and all the world be well lose for thou alone. 
hence those endear interest of life,
 the father, son, the brother, and the wife:
 here love extend run through different name,
 the fruitful fountain of ten thousand stream. 

thrice happy princess! bright with every grace,
 bless shall thou be, and bless in all thy race:
 for, like the royal stock from whence you come,
 a choose offspring shall extend your fame;
 and nation, yet unborn, shall bless your name. 

here then, young hero! fix thy eye, and see,
 aeneas-like, thy glorious progeny —
 see future nassau in bright order rise,
 fearless as William, and as Maurice wise. 
and as their form in gay procession glide,
 thy generous heart shall beat with noble pride;
 please that such prospect on thy virtue wait,
 which from this glorious Æra take their date;
 please that thy race succeed time shall bless,
 and give to war nation law, and peace.
