to the beauteous miss h—l—d.

far distant from brittannia lofty isle,
 what shall i find to make the genius smile? 
the bubble fountain lose the power to please,
 the rocky cataract, the shady tree,
 the juicy fruitage of enchant hue,
 who luscious virtue England never know;
 the variegate daughter of the land,
 who number Flora strow with bounteous hand;
 the verdant vesture of the smile field,
 all the rich pleasure nature store-house yield,
 have all their power to wake the chord string:
 but still they be subject that the muse can sing. 
h—l—d more beauteous than the god of day,
 her name can quicken and awake the lay;
 rouse the soft muse, from indolence and ease;
 to live, to love, and rouse her power to please. 
in vain will Phoebus, do not h—l—d rise:
 it be her bright eye that gild the eastern sky;
 it be she alone deprive we of the light;
 and when she slumber, then indeed it be night. 
to tell the separate beauty of her 'face
 will stretch eternity remote space,
 and want a more than man, to pen the line;
 i rest; let this suffice, dear h—l—d's all divine.
