The Amorist.

SEe where enammour'd Thirsis lies,
And cannot cease to gaze
On his Larissa's sparkling Eyes,
But takes Delight to see those Comets Blaze;
Whose Lustre still is Fatal to the Swain,
Ore whom they Reign,
For by their Influence the poor Shepheard Dies,
Or (more to be Lamented) Lives in Pain.
