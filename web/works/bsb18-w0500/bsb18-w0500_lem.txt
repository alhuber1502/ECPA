when home we return.

when home we return, after youth have be spend,
 and many a slow year have be waste and end,
 we often seem lose in the once wellknown place,
 and sigh to find age have so furrow dear face;
 for the rose that have fade the eye still keep mourning,
 and weep every change that it see on return. 

shall we miss but a tree where we use to be play,
 or find the wood cut where we saunter a-maying, â€”
 if the yew-seat's away, or the ivy want,
 we hate the fine lawn and the new-fashioned plant,
 each thing call improvement seem blacken with crime
 if it tear up one record of blissful old time. 

when many a spring have call forth the sweet flower,
 and many a autumn have paint the bower,
 i come to the place where life have its beginning,
 take root with the grove that around i be spring;
 when i find they all go, it be like dear friend depart,
 and i walk where they use to be half break hearted! 

when distant one bower my fancy still haunt,
 it be hang round with woodbine my Jessy have plant
 i run to the spot, where a weak flower remain
 can just nod its head to approve my complain,
 a tear for a dewdrop i hide in its fringe,
 and sigh then to think what one pleasure unhinge! 

but, ah! what be that to the friend oft estrange,
 their manner still more than their look daily change;
 where the heart use to warm to find civil behaviour,
 make we wish we have stay from our country for ever,
 with the sweet day of youth in our fancy still glow,
 and the love of old friend with old time ever grow!
