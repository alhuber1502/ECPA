have my daddie leave i gear enough.

have my daddy leave i gear enough,
 whenever i will gane to kirk or fair,
 ilk mither have hold out she loof,
 and lead i to her son and heir. 
now, gin a canker minny come
 and see her dawty set by i,
 she look as sour as gala plumb,
 and wonder what the fool can see. 

Hout! man, come here, you be sure blind,
 do you not see miss Fowler there? 
a bonnier lass you can find;
 i that there be no such dancer here. 
troth! some folk may have stay away,
 and no one will have have mist they yet,
 for fient a chiel i have see the day
 have spear gin she can dance a fit. 

then honest Jock loupt on the floor,
 and cry â€” we will all be canty yet! 
and if some grudge soul be here,
 o may they never dance a fit! 
and let they ken, if goud their pride,
 it be no win gear that be count yet,
 they be here will have take a poundless bride
 rise up, my lass, let we dance a fit.
