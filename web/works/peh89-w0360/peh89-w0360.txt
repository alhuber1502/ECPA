Written, originally extempore, on seeing a Mad HEIFER run through the Village where the Author lives. 

When summer smil'd, and birds on ev'ry spray,
 In joyous warblings tun'd their vocal lay,
 Nature on all sides shew'd a lovely scene,
 And people's minds were, like the air, serene;
 Sudden from th' herd we saw an heiser stray,
 And to our peaceful village bend her way. 
She spurns the ground with madness as she flies,
 And clouds of dust, like autumn mists, arise;
 Then bellows loud: the villagers alarm'd,
 Come rushing forth, with various weapons arm'd:
 Some run with pieces of old broken rakes,
 And some from hedges pluck the rotten stakes;
 Here one in haste, with hand-staff of his flail,
 And there another comes with half a rail:
 Whips, without lashes, sturdy plough-boys bring,
 While clods of dirt and pebbles others fling:
 Voices tumultuous rend the listening ear;
 Stop her — one cries; another — turn her there:
 But furiously she rushes by them all,
 And some huzza, and some to cursing fall:
 A mother snatch'd her infant off the road,
 Close to the spot of ground where next she trod;
 Camilla walking, trembled and turn'd pale;
 See o'er her gentle heart what fears prevail! 
At last the beast, unable to withstand
 Such force united, leapt into a pond:
 The water quickly cool'd her madden'd rage;
 No more she'll fright our village, I presage.
