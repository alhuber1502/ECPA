imitate from Jeremiah. â€” chap: xxxi. v. 15. 

hark, the voice of loud lament
 sound through ramah sadden plain! 
there cherish grief, there pine discontent,
 and desolation reign. 
there, amid her weep train
 see Rachel for her child mourn
 disconsolate, forlorn! 
the comforter she will not hear,
 and from his soothe strain she hopeless turn her ear. 
daughter of affliction peace,
 let, at last, thy sorrow cease,
 wipe thy sad stream eye,
 look up, behold thy child nigh:
 lo! thy vow have all be hear,
 see how vain thou have fear! 
see, from the destroyer land
 come the love, lament band;
 free from all their conquer foe
 glorious shall they seek repose;
 sure hope for thou remain,
 smile at all thy former pain;
 joy shall with thy child come,
 and all thy gladden bower shall bloom
