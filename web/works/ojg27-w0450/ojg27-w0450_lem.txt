fable [44] xliv 

the hound and the huntsman.

impertinence at first be bear
 with heedless slight, or smile of scorn;
 tease into wrath, what patience bear
 the noisy fool who persevere? 

the morning wake, the huntsman sound,
 at once rush forth the joyful hound;
 they seek the wood with eager pace,
 through bush, through brier explore the chase;
 now scatter wide they try the plain,
 and snuff the dewy turf in vain. 
what care, what industry, what pain! 
what universal silence reign! 

Ringwood, a dog of little fame,
 young, pert, and ignorant of game,
 at once display his babble throat;
 the pack, regardless of the note,
 pursue the scent; with loud strain
 he still persist to vex the train. 

the huntsman to the clamour fly,
 the smack lash he smart ply;
 his rib all welk, with howl tone
 the puppy thus express his moan. 

i know the music of my tongue
 long since the pack with envy sting;
 what will not spite? these bitter smart
 i owe to my superior part. 

when puppy prate, the huntsman cry,
 they show both ignorance and pride,
 fool may our scorn, not envy raise,
 for envy be a kind of praise. 
have not thy forward noisy tongue
 proclaim thou always in the wrong,
 thou may have mingle with the rest,
 and never thy foolish nose confess;
 but fool, to talk ever prone,
 be sure to make their folly know.
