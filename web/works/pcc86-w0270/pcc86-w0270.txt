To —.

IN this suspence, a thousand bear a part,
 With hopes and fears alternate to their heart;
 With equal mind — wait thy uncertain fate,
 Whate'er's pronounc'd, yet still thou may'st be great,
 If wealth and honour are decreed thy name,
 Let no resentment be thy future aim. 
Nor if! —
 Avert the thought — and in the doubtful hour,
 Be justice guarded by some heavenly power;
 Be D — still — and let thy spirit show
 Thou art thyself, howe'er this contest go.
