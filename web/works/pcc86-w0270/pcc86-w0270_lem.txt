in this suspense, a thousand bear a part,
 with hope and fear alternate to their heart;
 with equal mind — wait thy uncertain fate,
 whatever be pronounce, yet still thou may be great,
 if wealth and honour be decree thy name,

 be justice guard by some heavenly power;
 be d — still — and let thy spirit show
 thou be thyself, however this contest go.
