i have get a rock, i have get a reel.

i have get a rock, i have get a reel,
 i have get a wee bit spinning-wheel;
 and by the whirl rim i have find
 how the weary, weary warl go round. 
it be round and round the spoke they go,
 now one be up, and one be low;
 it be by up and down in Fortune wheel,
 that money one get a rock to reel. 

i have see a lassie barefoot gae,
 look dash and blate, with nought to say;
 but as the wheel turn round again,
 she chirp and talk, nor seem the same:
 sae fine she go, so far aglee,
 that folk she ken she can see;
 and fleech chiel around she throng,
 till she misken her all day long. 

there be Jock, when the bit lass be poor,
 never trudge over the long mossy moor,
 though now to the knee he wade, i trow,
 through winter weet and winter snow:
 and Pate declare the ither morn,
 she be like a lily among the corn;
 though once he swear she dazzle eye
 be bit of glass that black have be. 

now, lassy, i have find it out,
 what man make all this phrase about;
 for when they praise your blink thou,
 it be certain that your gowd they see:
 and when they talk of rose bland,
 they think of the rose of your land;
 but shall dame fortune turn her wheel,
 they will off in a dance of a threesome reel.
