fable [50] l. 

the hare and many friend.

friendship, like love, be but a name,
 unless to one you stint the flame. 
the child, who many father share,
 have seldom know a father care;
 it be thus in friendship; who depend
 on many, rare find a friend. 

a hare, who, in a civil way,
 comply with every thing, like gay,
 be know by all the bestial train,
 who haunt the wood, or graze the plain:
 her care be, never to offend,
 and every creature be her friend. 

as forth she go at early dawn
 to taste the dew-besprinkled lawn,
 behind she hear the hunter cry,
 and from the deepmouthed thunder fly;
 she start, she stop, she pant for breath,
 she hear the near advance of death,
 she double, to mislead the hound,
 and measure back her mazy round;
 until, faint in the public way,
 half dead with fear she gasp lie. 

what transport in her bosom grow,
 when first the horse appear in view! 

let i, say she, your back ascend,
 and owe my safety to a friend,
 you know my foot betray my flight,
 to friendship every burden light. 

the horse reply, poor honest puss,
 it grieve my heart to see thou thus;
 be comfort, relief be near;
 for all your friend be in the rear. 

she next the stately bull implore;
 and thus reply the mighty lord. 
since every beast alive can tell
 that i sincere wish you well,
 i may, without offence, pretend
 to take the freedom of a friend;
 love call i hence; a favourite cow
 expect i near yond barley mow:
 and when a lady be in the case,
 you know, all other thing give place. 
to leave you thus may seem unkind;
 but see, the goat be just behind. 

the goat remark her pulse be high,
 her languid head, her heavy eye;
 my back, say he, may do you harm;
 the sheep at hand, and wool be warm. 

the sheep be feeble, and complain,
 his side a load of wool sustain,
 say he be slow, confess his fear;
 for hound eat sheep as well as hare. 

she now the trot calf address,
 to save from death a friend distress. 

shall i, say he, of tender age,
 in this important care engage? 
old and able past you by;
 how strong be those! how weak be i! 
shall i presume to bear you hence,
 those friend of i may take offence. 
excuse i then. you know my heart. 
but dear friend, alas, must part! 
how shall we all lament! adieu. 
for see the hound be just in view.
