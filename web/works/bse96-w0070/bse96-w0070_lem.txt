sonnet.

ingratitude, — how deadly be thy smart,
 proceed from the form we fond love! 
how light, compare, all other sorrow prove! 
thou shed a night of woe, from whence depart
 the gentle beam of patience, that the heart
 amid less ill illume. — thy victim rove
 unquiet as the ghost that haunt the grove
 where murder spill the lifeblood. — o! thy dart
 kill more than life, even all that make it dear;
 till we the "sensible of pain" will change
 for frenzy, that defy the bitter tear,
 or wish, in kindred callousness, to range
 where moon-eyed idiocy, with fall lip,
 drag the loose knee, and intermit step.
