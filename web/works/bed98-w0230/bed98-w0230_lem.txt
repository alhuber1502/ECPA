to ELIZA s — —.

the weary traveller tire with roam,
homeward turn his will foot,
kind, friendly counsel give,
if a stranger he shall meet.

heaven speed thy journey gentle stranger,
thine a road which i have go,
think not my friendship too presume,
if its danger i make know.

a pleasant hill now lie before thou,
mind to keep the middle way,
danger in please form shall 'tice thou,
lure thou from thy path to stray.

but a faithful guide attend,
thou will discern each specious foe,
and her unerring glass present,
show they lead to last woe.

vain may pleasure seek to tempt thou,
though with flower her path be spread,
thy guide can see her votary haste,
to the mansion of the dead.

some, you will observe intemperance lead,
to her bower of cloy sweet,
but from behind yond ghastly figure,
drag they to their fell retreat.

her crown of poppy ease may offer,
on down entreat thou to repose;
but in the inglorious lake oblivion,
all her votary she throw.

there too sink those lead by folly,
and dissipation giddy train,
nor those who vanity be lead,
can her empty gift retain.

as towards the summit thou be ascend,
other foe shall thou surround,
be sure to keep a steady foot,
it be all enchant ground.

to her high land ambition tempt thou,
show thou grandeur envy state:
believe it all a fair delusion.
wretched be her follower fate.

some she lead over sea tempestuous,
sink beneath the foam wave,
other, from dreadful height she plunge,
find below untimely grave.

from all these foe thy guide shall save thou,
pleasant may thou find the road,
innocence thy fair attendant,
to bright wisdom bless abode.

prosperous be thy journey, stranger,
thine a road i well have know;
nor think my friendship too presume,
if its danger i have show.
