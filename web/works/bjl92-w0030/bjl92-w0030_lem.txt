to hope.

i 

hail meek-eyed maid! of matchless worth! 
our best companion here on earth;
 to thou sole power be give,
 the illume our dark and dreary way,
 as through life mazy path we stray,
 and bend our step to heaven. 
it be thy to smooth the rugged vale,
 to stem the trickle tear;
 thy whisper, as the spicy gale,
 do droop traveller cheer. 
incline thou, to shine now
 upon i as i go;
 thy favour shall ever
 alleviate my woe. 

ii.

thy presence calm the rage sea,
 and to the throb breast give ease
 amid the tempest howl,
 when wave appear as mountain high,
 when swell surge dash the sky,
 and foam billow roll;
 when danger, with uplift hand,
 proclaim the approach doom,
 thou gentle do the stroke withstand,
 and dissipate the gloom. 
when care, despair,
 and deem all as lose,
 thy ray will portray still
 the long expect coast. 

iii.

thou animate the hero flame;
 to he present a deathless name
 in the ensanguine field:
 thou do his nerve with valour brace,
 bid he, with bold undaunted face,
 destructive weapon wield. 
war trumpet, breathe rude alarm,
 strike terror all around;
 thy voice of fame, and honour charm,
 outvie the direful sound. 
when fall, appal
 the tumult wild increase,
 on wing then, thou bring then
 the harbinger of peace. 

iv.

thy power elate the student view;
 the path of science kind strew
 with never-fading flower. 
deprive of thou, how lover mourn
 deject, restless and forlorn,
 in unfrequented bower! 
attend still on Hymen rite,
 thou decorate the chain;
 thy smile the sprightly maid invite
 and lure the youthful swain:
 still ease, and please,
 when stern misfortune stare,
 'amid loss, and cross,
 thou lighten all their care. 

v. 

from life fair dawn to liart eve,
 we all thy flatter tale believe,
 enamour of thy art:
 thy soft and salutary voice
 give birth to unexpected joy,
 and soothe the bleed heart:
 and even at our late hour,
 when earthly comfort fly,
 thou do, by a superior power,
 death terror all defy. 
not grieve, when leave
 this scene of dole and care,
 but view, pursue
 a more exalt sphere.
