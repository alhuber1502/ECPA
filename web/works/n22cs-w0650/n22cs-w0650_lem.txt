song.

do pity give, though fate deny,
 and to my wound her balm impart? 
o speak! with those expressive eye;
 let one low sigh escape thy heart. 

the gaze crowd shall never guess
 what anxious, watchful love can see;
 nor know what those soft look express,
 nor dream that sigh be mean for i. 

ah! word be useless word be vain,
 thy generous sympathy to prove;
 and well, that sigh, those look explain,
 that Clara mourn my hapless love.
