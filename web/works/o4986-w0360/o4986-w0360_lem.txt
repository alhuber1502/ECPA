ode to may.

by the same.

fair daughter of the year,
 ever bloom, lovely may;
 while thy vivid sky appear,
 nature smile, and all be gay. 

thy the flowery-painted mead,
 pasture fair, and mountain green;
 thy, with infant-harvest spread,
 laugh lie the lowland scene. 

friend of thy, the shepherd play
 blithsome near the yellow broom,
 while his flock, that careless stray,
 seek the wild thyme sweet perfume. 

may, with thou i mean to rove
 over these lawn and valley fair,
 tune my gentle lyre to love,
 cherish hope, and soften care. 

round i shall the village swain,
 shall the rosy nymph, appear;
 while i sing in rural strain,
 may, to shepherd ever dear. 

i have never skill to raise
 pean from the vocal string,
 to the god-like hero praise,
 to the pageant pomp of king,

stranger to the hostile plain,
 where the brazen trumpet sound;
 life purple stream the verdure stain,
 and heap promiscuous press the ground:

where the murderous cannon breath
 fate denounce from afar,
 and the loud report of death
 stun the cruel ear of war. 

stranger to the park and play,
 birth-night ball, and courtly train;
 thou i woo, my gentle may,
 tune for thou my native strain. 

bloom grove, and wander rill,
 sooth thy vacant poet dream,
 vocal wood, and wild, and hill,
 all her unexalted theme.
