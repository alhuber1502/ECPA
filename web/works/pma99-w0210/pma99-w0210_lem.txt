address to sleep.

descend, sweet sleep, my eyelid close
 with peace-restoring balm;
 it be thou alone can heal my woe,
 and lull i to a calm. 

come then on fancy airy wing
 with all thy please train,
 thy kind delusion with thou bring,
 and lull my ache brain. 

but why so oft must i in vain
 invoke thy sovereign power? 
say, cruel, why do thou disdain
 on i thy bliss to shower? 

free by heaven on all thou be shed,
 the gift all nature share,
 why then from i so distant flee? 
ah! why not hear my prayer? 

why, like the selfish and the vain,
 thus deaf to sorrow cry,
 court none but pleasure smile train,
 and shun the weep eye? 

do wicked thought within my breast
 a welcome harbour meet,
 do i, when lie down to rest,
 plot or contrive deceit,

then can i not presume to find
 remission of my grief;
 for whither can a guilty mind
 resort for its relief? 

but soft! sure it be a voice that say â€”
 "stop! thy rebuke be vain;
 man by his maker first be make
 exempt from grief or pain."
