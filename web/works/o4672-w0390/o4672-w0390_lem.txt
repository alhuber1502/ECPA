to mr. John lock retire from the world of business.

i 

angel be make of heavenly thing,
 and light and love our soul compose,
 their bliss within their bosom spring,
 within their bosom flow. 
but narrow mind still make pretence
 to search the coast of flesh and sense,
 and fetch divine pleasure thence. 
man be akin to ethereal form,
 but they belie their noble birth,
 debase their honour down to earth,
 and claim a share with worm. 

ii.

he that have treasure of his own
 may leave the cottage or the throne,
 may quit the globe, and dwell alone
 within his spacious mind. 
lock have a soul wide as the sea,
 calm as the night, bright as the day,
 there may his vast idea play,
 nor feel a thought confine.
