on a goldfinch starve to death in his cage.

1. 

time be when i be free as air,
 the thistle downy seed my fare,
 my drink the morning dew;
 i perch at will on every spray,
 my form genteel, my plumage gay,
 my strain for ever new. 

2. 

but gawdy plumage, sprightly strain,
 and form genteel be all in vain
 and of a transient date,
 for catch and cage and starve to death,
 in die sigh my little breath
 soon pass the wiry grate. 

3. 

thanks, gentle swain, for all my woe,
 and thanks for this effectual close
 and cure of every ill! 
more cruelty can none express,
 and i, if you have show i less
 have be your prisoner still.
