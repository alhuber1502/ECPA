On a GOLDFINCH starved to Death in his Cage.

1.

TIME was when I was free as air,
 The thistles downy seed my fare,
 My drink the morning dew;
 I perch'd at will on ev'ry spray,
 My form genteel, my plumage gay,
 My strains for ever new. 

2.

But gawdy plumage, sprightly strain,
 And form genteel were all in vain
 And of a transient date,
 For caught and caged and starved to death,
 In dying sighs my little breath
 Soon pass'd the wiry grate. 

3.

Thanks, gentle swain, for all my woes,
 And thanks for this effectual close
 And cure of ev'ry ill! 
More cruelty could none express,
 And I, if you had shewn me less
 Had been your pris'ner still.
