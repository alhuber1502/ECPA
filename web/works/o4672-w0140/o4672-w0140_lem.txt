the day of judgement.

a ode, attempt in english sapphic. 

i 

when the fierce northwind with his airy force
 rear up the baltic to a foam fury,
 and the red lightning with a storm of hail come
 rush amain down,

ii.

how the poor sailor stand amaze and tremble! 
while the hoarse thunder like a bloody trumpet
 roar a loud onset to the gape water
 quick to devour they. 

iii.

such shall the noise be and the wild disorder,
 (if thing eternal may be like these earthly)
 such the dire terror when the great archangel
 shake the creation,

iv.

tear the strong pillar of the vault of heaven,
 break up old marble the repose of prince;
 see the grave open, and the bone arise,
 flame all around they. 

v. 

hark the shrill outcries of the guilty wretch! 
lively bright horror and amaze anguish
 stare through their eyelid, while the live worm lie
 gnaw within they. 

vi.

thought like old vulture prey upon their heartstring,
 and the smart twinge, when their eye behold the
 lofty judge frown, and a flood of vengeance
 roll afore he. 

vii.

hopeless immortal! how they scream and shiver
 while devil push they to the pit wide yawn
 hideous and gloomy, to receive they headlong
 down to the centre. 

viii.

stop here my fancy: (all away you horrid
 doleful idea;) come arise to Jesus,
 how he sit godlike! and the saint around he
 throned and adore! 

ix.

o may i sit there when he come triumphant
 doom the nation: then ascend to glory,
 while our hosannah all along the passage
 shout the redeemer.
