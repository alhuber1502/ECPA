THE Day of Judgment.

An ODE, Attempted in English Sapphick. 

I.

WHEN the Fierce North-wind with his Airy Forces
 Rears up the Baltick to a foaming Fury,
 And the red Lightning with a Storm of Hail comes
 Rushing amain down,

II.

How the poor Sailers stand amaz'd and tremble! 
While the hoarse Thunder like a Bloody Trumpet
 Roars a loud onset to the gaping Waters
 Quick to devour them. 

III.

Such shall the Noise be and the Wild disorder,
 (If things Eternal may be like these Earthly)
 Such the dire Terror when the great Archangel
 Shakes the Creation,

IV.

Tears the strong Pillars of the Vault of Heaven,
 Breaks up old Marble the Repose of Princes;
 See the Graves open, and the Bones arising,
 Flames all around 'em. 

V.

Hark the shrill Out-cries of the Guilty Wretches! 
Lively bright Horror and amazing Anguish
 Stare thro' their Eyelids, while the living Worm lies
 Gnawing within them. 

VI.

Thoughts like old Vultures prey upon their Heartstrings,
 And the smart twinges, when their Eye beholds the
 Lofty Judge frowning, and a Flood of Vengeance
 Rolling afore him. 

VII.

Hopeless Immortals! how they scream and shiver
 While Devils push them to the Pit wide Yawning
 Hideous and gloomy, to receive them headlong
 Down to the Centre. 

VIII.

Stop here my Fancy: (All away ye horrid
 Doleful Ideas;) Come arise to Jesus,
 How he sits Godlike! And the Saints around him
 Thron'd and adoring! 

IX.

O may I sit there when he comes Triumphant
 Dooming the Nations: Then ascend to Glory,
 While our Hosannahs all along the Passage
 Shout the Redeemer.
