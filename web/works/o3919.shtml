She regards you with pride, as one of the few, who, at the present period, rescue her from the imputation of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the form of Apology, I should have much to say, if I again dared to plead the pressure of evils, aggravated by their long continuance, as an excuse for the defects of this attempt.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d13315e1631">[Page vii]</span><p id="o3919-s00060">Whatever may be the faults of its execution, let me vindicate myself from those, that may be imputed to the design. — In speaking of the Emigrant Clergy, I beg to be understood as feeling the utmost respect for the integrity of their principles; and it is with pleasure I add my suffrage to that of those, who have had a similar opportunity of witnessing the conduct of the Emigrants of all descriptions during their exile in England; which has been such as does honour to <span class="hi">their</span> nation, and ought to secure to them in ours the esteem of every liberal mind.</p><p id="o3919-s00065">Your philanthropy, dear Sir, will induce you, I am persuaded, to join with me in hoping, that this painful exile may finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred so unworthy of great and enlightened nations; that it may tend to humanize both countries, by convincing each, that good qualities exist in the other; and at length annihilate the prejudices that have so long existed to the injury of both.</p><p id="o3919-s00070">Yet it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of the English, this national aversion has acquired new force by the dreadful scenes which have been acted in France during<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d13315e2537">[Page viii]</span> the last summer — even those who are the victims of the Revolution, have not escaped the odium, which the undistinguishing multitude annex to all the natives of a country where such horrors have been acted: nor is this the worst effect those events have had on the minds of the English; by confounding the original cause with the wretched catastrophes that have followed its ill management; the attempts of public virtue, with the outrages that guilt and folly have committed in its disguise, the very name of Liberty has not only lost the charm it used to have in British ears, but many, who have written, or spoken, in its defence, have been stigmatized as promoters of Anarchy, and enemies to the prosperity of their country. Perhaps even the Author of "The Task," with all his goodness and tenderness of heart, is in the catalogue of those, who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cause, which it was once the glory of Englishmen to avow and defend — The exquisite Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her sincerest friends, was published some years before the demolition of regal despotisin in France, which, in the fifth book, it seems<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d13315e3477">[Page ix]</span> to foretell — All the truth and energy of the passage to which I allude, must have been strongly felt, when, in the Parliament of England, the greatest Orator of our time quoted the sublimest of our Poets — when the eloquence of Fox did justice to the genius of Cowper.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">I am, dear SIR, With the most perfect esteem, Your obliged and obedient servant, CHARLOTTE SMITH.</div><div class="dateline">Brighthelmstone, <span class="date">May 10, 1793.</span></div></div></section></div><li><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-4">Lately Published, BY THE SAME AUTHOR, PRINTED FOR T.
