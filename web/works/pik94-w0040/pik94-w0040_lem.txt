Miranda and the red-breast.

a fable for the lady.

the vain Miranda long have shine,
 in fashion brilliant scene;
 each heart confess she pass fair,
 and hail her beauty queen. 

unrivalled long Miranda live,
 of british maid the toast,
 and with tyrannic sway she reign,
 a celebrate toast;

till bright Emeline appear,
 fair as the open morn,
 then Myra only swell the group
 sweet Emma do adorn. 

the haughty maid, that never can brook
 even one neglect eye,
 with burst pride behold her charm
 unnoticed now past by. 

conflict passion tear her breast;
 to distant scene she fly,
 to seek in solitude that calm
 reflection never deny;

but ah! in vain, the venom dart
 within her bosom lie,
 and pride repress can never bestow,
 of peace the faint ray. 

one silent eve she reach a grove,
 there to lament her fate,
 where modest robin pensive sing,
 and cheere his little mate:

with scorn she hear the plaintive lay,
 and, with disdainful look,
 "presume feeble wretch," she cry;
 the little redbreast shake:

 "chirp not, thou vain, thou sorry thing,
" hark philomela strain;
 unworthy thou to share her haunt,
 "the mean of her train:

 "be ever dumb, assume bird,
" dare thou ever hope to please,
 "when lark salute the early morn,
" and thrush sing from tree? 

 "ambitious thing, i say give over;
" the blackbird warble song
 "in just contempt will sink thy note;
" for ever stop thy tongue. " 

meek robin, in the sweet strain,
 with soft accent speak,
 shelter his partner with his wing,
 thus, tremble, silence break:

 "pardon, bright fair! i know not pride,
" foe to ambition i;
 "humble poor robin own he never
" with thrush or lark can vie:

 "indeed i try to imitate
" sweet philomela lay,
 "and to the warble blackbird song
" sincere homage pay;

 "and when that wintery storm descend,
" each vernal beauty seize,
 "when they retire till mild hour,
" poor robin try to please;

 "it be then with timid hope i strive
" to soothe the listen ear,
 "my bright reward, a little food,
" these hour of want to cheer:

 "then hear, you sweet bird of air,
" the humble: of your throng;
 "it be when you will not deign to cheer,
" poor robin give his song:

 "hence learn, Miranda, bright and fair,
" let meekness pride disarm;
 "vouchsafe to learn from little i,
" heaven give to each a charm. " 

to hear a moral from a bird,
 abash Miranda stand,
 return to town, seek Emeline,
 be happy, kind, and good.
