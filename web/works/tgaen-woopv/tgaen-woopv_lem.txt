[ode on the pleasure arise from vicissitude]

now the golden morn aloft
wave her dew-bespangled wing;
with vermeil cheek and whisper soft
she woo the tardy spring,
till April start, and call around
the sleep fragrance from the ground;
and light over the live scene
scatter his fresh, tender green.

new-born flock in rustic dance
frisk ply their feeble foot;
forgetful of their wintery trance
the bird his presence greet:
but chief the skylark warble high
his tremble thrill ecstasy
and, lessen from the dazzle sight,
melt into air and liquid light.

yesterday the sullen year
see the snowy whirlwind fly;
mute be the music of the air,
the herd stand droop by:
their rapture now that wild flow,
no yesterday nor morrow know;
it be man alone that joy descry
with forward and revert eye.

smile on past misfortune brow
soft reflection hand can trace;
and over the cheek of sorrow throw
a melancholy grace;
while hope prolong our happy hour,
or deep shade, that dim low
and blacken round our weary way,
gild with a gleam of distant day.

still, where rosy pleasure lead,
see a kindred grief pursue;
behind the step that misery tread,
approach comfort view:
the hue of bliss more bright glow,
chastise by sable tint of woe;
and blend form, with artful strife,
the strength and harmony of life.

see the wretch, that long have toss
on the thorny bed of pain,
at length repair his vigour lose,
and breathe and walk again:
the mean floweret of the vale,
the simple note that swell the gale,
the common sun, the air and sky,
to he be open paradise.

humble quiet build her cell
near the source whence pleasure flow;
she eye the clear crystalline well
and taste it as it go.
far below [...] the crowd.
broad and turbulent it grow
[...] with resistless sweep
they perish in the boundless deep

Mark where indolence and pride,
soft roll side by side,
their dull but daily round.
