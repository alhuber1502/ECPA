the vanity of the world, in a poem to the athenian.

what if serene bless with calm i swim
 Pactolus! in thy golden sand stream? 
not all the wealth that lavish chance can give
 my soul from death can one short hour reprieve. 
when from my heart the wander life must move
 no cordial all my useless gold can prove. 
what though i plunge in joy so deep and wide,
 it will tire my thought to reach the distant side,
 fancy it self it will tire to plumb the abyss;
 if i for a uncertain lease of this
 sell the fair hope of a eternal bliss? 
what if invest with the royal state
 of dazzle queen, adore by king i sit? 
yet when my tremble soul dislodge will be
 no room of state within the grave for i. 
what if my youth, in wit and beauty bloom
 shall promise many a flatter year to come:
 though death shall pass the beauteous flourisher,
 advance time will all its glory mar. 
what if the muse loud sing my fame,
 the barren mountain echo with my name? 
a envious puff may blast the rise pride. 
and all its bright conspicuous lustre hide. 
if over my relic monument they raise
 and fill the world with flattery, or with praise,
 what will they all avail, if sink i must,
 my soul to endless shade, my body to the dust?
