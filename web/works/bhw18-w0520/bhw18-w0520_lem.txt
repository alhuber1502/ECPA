address to a. C., a infant, on his first new-year day, 1821. 

i 

dear babe, soft object of my care,
 unseen, for who i pour my prayer;
 unknown, yet prize all else above,
 the heir of my maternal love;
 ah, let i hail, in simple lie,
 thy early new-year day! 

ii.

nor past, nor future cloud thy brow,
 thy range of thought confine to now;
 calm on a mother breast you lie,
 and heed not if, with tearful eye,
 for thou her wish fond stray
 over many a new-year day. 

iii.

yet soon the year in rapid flight
 shall wake thy heart to new delight;
 soon shall exult youth draw near,
 with charm so fresh, and hope so dear;
 and lovely as the bloom of may
 shall seem each new-year day. 

iv.

but ah, since time at length will bring
 no rapture on his weary wing,
 then, over thy path, no long bright,
 may virtue shed a line of light,
 that cheer the pilgrim, when his way
 lead to no new-year day!
