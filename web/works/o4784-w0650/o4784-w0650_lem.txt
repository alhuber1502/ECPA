eph. 

what friendship be, ardelia show

Ard. 

it be to love, as i love you. 

eph. 

this account, so short (though kind)
 suit not my inquire mind. 
therefore farther now repeat;
 what be friendship when complete? 

Ard. 

it be to share all joy and grief;
 it be to lend all due relief
 from the tongue, the heart, the hand;
 it be to mortgage house and land;
 for a friend be sell a slave;
 it be to die upon a grave,
 if a friend therein do lie. 

eph. 

this indeed, though carry high,
 this, though more than ever be do
 underneath the roll sun,
 this have all be say before. 
can ardelia say no more? 

Ard. 

word indeed no more can show:
 but it be to love, as i love you.
