Written in Winter.

Now o'er the fading landscape all around
 His silver mantle hoary Winter spreads:
 No more the groves with melody resound,
 No cheerful herbage crowns the lonely meads. 

Bleak blows the wind o'er yon deserted plain;
 While lowering clouds obscure the wintry sky,
 And sickening Nature sees with tender pain
 The flowery progeny of Summer die. 

Thus, in warm youth, vain Beauty's fleeting power
 Charms for a moment Love's fantastic eye;
 Old Age or Sickness crops the short-liv'd flower,
 And wither'd all its brightest honours lie. 
But Virtue, arm'd against Time's rudest blast,
 Shall, like the laurel, ever verdant last.
