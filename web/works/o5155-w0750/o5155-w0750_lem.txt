1753. 

i 

how easy be Colin, how blithe and how gay!
ere he meet the fair Chloris, how sprightly his lay!
so graceful her form, so accomplish her mind,
sure pity, he think, with such charm must be join!

ii.

whenever she dance, or whenever she sing,
how just be her motion, how sweet be her tongue!
and when the youth tell she his passionate flame,
she allow he to fancy her heart feel the same.

iii.

with ardour he press she to think he sincere,
but alas! she redouble each hope and each fear;
she will not deny, nor she will not approve,
and she neither refuse he, nor give he her love.

iv.

now cheere by complacence, now freeze by disdain,
he languish for freedom, but languish in vain:
till thyrsis, who pity so helpless a slave,
ease his heart of its pain by the counsel he give.

v. 

forsake she, say he, and reject she awhile;
if she love you, she soon will return with a smile:
you can judge of her passion by absence alone,
and by absence will conquer her heart or â€” your own.

vi.

this advice he pursue; but the remedy prove
too fatal, alas, to the fair one he love;
which cure his own passion, but leave she in vain
to sigh for a heart she can never regain.
