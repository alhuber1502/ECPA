the phoenix. 

a song. 

a female friend advise a Swain
 (who heart she wish at ease)
 make love thy pleasure, not thy pain,
 nor let it deep seize. 

beauty, where vanity abound,
 no serious passion claim;
 then, until a phoenix can be find,
 do not admit the flame. 

but grieve she find, that his reply
 (since prepossess when young)
 take all their hint from silvia eye,
 none from ardelia's tongue. 

thus, Cupid, of our aim we miss,
 who will unbend thy bow;
 and each slight nymph a phoenix be,
 when love will have it so.
