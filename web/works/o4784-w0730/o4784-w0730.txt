The PHOENIX. 

A SONG. 

A Female Friend advis'd a Swain
 (Whose Heart she wish'd at ease)
 Make Love thy Pleasure, not thy Pain,
 Nor let it deeply seize. 

Beauty, where Vanities abound,
 No serious Passion claims;
 Then, 'till a Phoenix can be found,
 Do not admit the Flames. 

But griev'd She finds, that his Replies
 (Since prepossess'd when Young)
 Take all their Hints from Silvia's Eyes,
 None from ARDELIA's Tongue. 

Thus, Cupid, of our Aim we miss,
 Who wou'd unbend thy Bow;
 And each slight Nymph a Phoenix is,
 When Love will have it so.
