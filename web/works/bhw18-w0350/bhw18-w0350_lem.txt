elegy on a young thrush,

which escape from the writer hand, and fall down the area of a house, can not be find.

mistaken bird, ah whither have thou stray? 
my friendly grasp why eager to elude? 
this hand be on thy pinion light lay,
 and fear to hurt thou by a touch too rude. 

be there no foresight in a thrush breast,
 that thou down yonder gulph from i will go? 
that gloomy area lurk cat infest,
 and there the dog may rove, alike thy foe. 

i will with lavish crumb my bird have feed,
 and bring a crystal cup to wet thy bill;
 i will have make of down and moss thy bed,
 soft, though not fashion with a thrush skill. 

soon as thy strengthen wing can mount the sky,
 my will hand have set my captive free;
 ah, not for she who love the muse, to buy
 a selfish pleasure, buy with pain to thou! 

the vital air, and liberty, and light
 have all be thy; and love, and rapturous song,
 and sweet parental joy, in rapid flight,
 have lead the circle of thy life along. 

secure to my window have thou fly,
 and ever thy accustom morsel find;
 nor shall thy trust breast the want have know
 which other thrush know when winter frown. 

frame with the wisdom nature lend to thou,
 thy house of straw have brave the tempest rage,
 and thou through many a spring have live to see
 the utmost limit of a thrush age. 

ill-fated bird! â€” and do the thrush race,
 like man, mistake the path that lead to bliss? 
or, when his eye that tranquil path can trace,
 the good he well discern through folly miss?
