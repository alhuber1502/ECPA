The RESOLUTION.

The Favours of Fortune I once hop'd to gain,
 And often invok'd her, but ever in vain. 
She despis'd my Addresses, which gave me such Grief,
 I flew to the Muses, in Hopes of Relief. 
Ah Wretch that I was! I might very well know,
 'Twas the Method to make her for ever my Foe. 
They laugh'd at the Goddess, and bid me despise her;
 But Time and Experience have made me grow wiser. 
This unhappy Mistake I resolve to repair. 
O Fortune! thy Votaries must persevere.
