the resolution.

the favour of fortune i once hope to gain,
 and often invoke she, but ever in vain. 
she despise my address, which give i such grief,
 i fly to the muse, in hope of relief. 
ah wretch that i be! i may very well know,
 it be the method to make she for ever my foe. 
they laugh at the goddess, and bid i despise she;
 but time and experience have make i grow wise. 
this unhappy mistake i resolve to repair. 
o fortune! thy votary must persevere.
