THE DIRGE OF AMORET.

WHY glide the hours so swift away,
 When love and fortune shine? 
Years seem'd but as a passing day,
 When Amoret was mine. 
Was mine! sad sounds, ye ring my knell,
 And bid to joy a long farewell! 

Her voice could sooth the soul of care,
 And lull despair to rest;
 Why was she form'd divinely fair? 
And why was I so bless'd? 
So bless'd no more; I hear the knell,
 Which bids the world a long farewell.
