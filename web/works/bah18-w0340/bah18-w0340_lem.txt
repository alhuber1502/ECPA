the dirge of Amoret.

why glide the hour so swift away,
 when love and fortune shine? 
year seem but as a pass day,
 when Amoret be mine. 
be mine! sad sound, you ring my knell,
 and bid to joy a long farewell! 

her voice can sooth the soul of care,
 and lull despair to rest;
 why be she form divine fair? 
and why be i so bless? 
so bless no more; i hear the knell,
 which bid the world a long farewell.
