to mr. Nicholas Clark. 

complain of vapor, or, disorder of the head.

i 

it be in a vale where osyer grow
 by murmur stream we tell our woe,
 and mingle all our care:
 friendship sit please in both our eye,
 in both the weep dew arise
 and drop alternate tear. 

ii.

the vigorous monarch of the day
 now mount half his morning way
 shine with a faint bright,
 still sicken and decay still
 dim he wander up the hill
 with his expire light. 

iii.

in dark eclipse his chariot roll,
 the queen of night obscure his gold
 behind her sable wheel:
 nature grow sad to loose the day,
 the flowery vale in mourning lie,
 in mourning stand the hill. 

iv.

such be our sorrow, Clark, i cry,
 cloud of the brain grow black, and hide
 our darken soul behind;
 in the young morning of our year
 distemper fog have climb the sphere,
 and choke the labour mind. 

v. 

lo the gay planet rear his head
 and overlook the lofty shade
 new-bright'ning all the sky,
 but say, dear partner of my moan,
 when will our long eclipse be go,
 or when our sun arise? 

vi.

in vain be potent herb apply,
 harmonious sound in vain have try
 to make the darkness fly. 
but drug will raise the dead as soon,
 or clatter brass relieve the moon,
 when faint in the sky. 

vii.

some friendly spirit from above,
 bear of the light, and nurse with love,
 assist our feeble fire;
 force these invade gloom away;
 soul shall be see quite through their clay
 bright as your heavenly choirs. 

viii.

but if the fog must damp the flame,
 gentle, kind death, dissolve our frame,
 release the prisoner-mind:
 our soul shall mount at thy discharge
 to their bright source, and shine at large
 nor cloud, nor confine.
