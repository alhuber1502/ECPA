candour.

the warm friend, i ever prove,
my bitter foe i see:
the kind maid i ever love,
be false to love and i.

but shall i make the angry vow,
which tempt my waver mind?
shall dark suspicion cloud my brow,
and bid i shun mankind?

avaunt, thou hellborn fiend! no more
pretend my step to guide;
let i be cheat over and over,
but let i still confide.

if this be folly, all my claim
to wisdom i resign;
but let no sage presume to name
his happiness with i.
