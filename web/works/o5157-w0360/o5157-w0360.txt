CANDOUR.

THE warmest friend, I ever prov'd,
My bitterest foe I see:
The kindest maid I ever lov'd,
Is false to love and me.

But shall I make the angry vow,
Which tempts my wavering mind?
Shall dark suspicion cloud my brow,
And bid me shun mankind?

Avaunt, thou hell-born fiend! no more
Pretend my steps to guide;
Let me be cheated o'er and o'er,
But let me still confide.

If this be folly, all my claim
To wisdom I resign;
But let no sage presume to name
His happiness with mine.
