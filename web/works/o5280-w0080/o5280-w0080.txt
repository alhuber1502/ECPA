IMPROMPTU, ON HEARING, AS HE WAS RISING IN THE MORNING, OF THE DEATH OF THE REV. JOHN DUNCOMBE, M.A.

INSCRIBED TO MRS. DUNCOMBE, OF CANTERBURY.

PEACE to the spot where his remains are laid;
 May purest bliss await his friendly shade! 
Nature by him had done her noblest part:
 She gave a head, nor yet denied a heart.
