impromptu, on hear, as he be rise in the morning, of the death of the reverend JOHN Duncombe, m.a. 

inscribe to mrs. Duncombe, of Canterbury.

peace to the spot where his remains be lay;
 may pure bliss await his friendly shade! 
nature by he have do her noble part:
 she give a head, nor yet deny a heart.
