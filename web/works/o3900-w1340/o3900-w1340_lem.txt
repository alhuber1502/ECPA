grace before meat.

i 

parent of good, who plenteous grace
 over all thy creature flow,
 humble we ask thy power to bless
 the food thy love bestow. 

ii.

thy love provide the sober feast:
 a second gift impart,
 give we with joy our food to taste
 and with a single heart. 

iii.

let it for thou new life afford,
 for thou our strength repair,
 bless by thy all-sustaining word,
 and sanctify by prayer. 

iv.

thou let we taste; nor toil below
 for perishable meat:
 the manna of thy love bestow,
 give we thy flesh to eat. 

v. 

life of the world, our soul to feed
 thyself descend from high! 
grant we of thou the live bread
 to eat, and never die!
