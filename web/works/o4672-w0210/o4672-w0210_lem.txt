brotherly love.

psalm cxxxiii.

i 

lo, what a entertain sight
 be brother that agree,
 brother who cheerful heart unite
 in band of piety. 

ii.

when stream of love from Christ the spring
 descend to every soul,
 and sacred peace with balmy wing
 shade and bedew the whole;

iii.

it be like the oil on Aaron shed
 which choice perfume compose,
 down soft from his reverend head
 it trickle to his toe. 

iv.

it be pleasant as the morning dew
 that fall on zion hill;
 where god his mild glory show,
 and make his grace distil.
