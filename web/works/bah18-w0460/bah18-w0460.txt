SONG.

O Tuneful voice, I still deplore
 Those accents which, tho' heard no more,
 Still vibrate on my heart;
 In echo's cave I long to dwell,
 And still would hear the sad farewell,
 When we were doom'd to part. 

Bright eyes, O that the task were mine,
 To guard the liquid fires that shine,
 And round your orbits play;
 To watch them with a vestal's care,
 And feed with smiles a light so fair. 
That it may ne'er decay.
