song.

o tuneful voice, i still deplore
 those accent which, though hear no more,
 still vibrate on my heart;
 in echo cave i long to dwell,
 and still will hear the sad farewell,
 when we be doom to part. 

bright eye, o that the task be i,
 to guard the liquid fire that shine,
 and round your orbit play;
 to watch they with a vestal care,
 and feed with smile a light so fair. 
that it may never decay.
