The Fatality.

Come all ye grand Predestinarians now,
 Your Doctrine to the Height I will allow:
 I who with utmost Force resist my Fate,
 But am to Ills alone predestinate;
 In vain I strive th' immutable Decree,
 Has pass'd on my unlucky Destiny. 
With Sighs and Tears I did at first begin,
 To conquer Fate as others would their Sin;
 Each Path I trod I went with Caution on,
 But every Step doth lead to be undone:
 And when a threatening Storm was in my View,
 I from it (wisely as I thought) withdrew;
 But whilst the approaching Ills with Fear I shun,
 Into some other certain Harms I run;
 So when some mighty Grief did press my Soul,
 I would th' uneasy Tyranny controul;
 (Like a distracted Man that will not bear,
 Those Fetters which Discretion makes him wear;
 But frets and raves, and breaks the friendly Chain,
 Which did from greater Injuries restrain;
 He'll not be bar'd a dangerous Liberty,
 Tho' he to Outrages and Mischief fly.) 
Thus I from one Misfortune force my Way,
 By Means that does to greater still betray;
 One Sorrow seldom attends long on me,
 I have a torturing Variety,
 I change and change, yet still 'tis Misery. 
A Hydra Fate my Ruin does pursue,
 Cut off one ill, strait, there springs up a new,
 And they'll arise ad infinitum too. 
Ther's none the mystick Scrolls of Fate can read,
 Nor shun the Ills by mighty Powers decreed,
 Hood-wink'd by them, just as they guide we tread. 
In vain we say we this or that will do,
 It cannot be unless they'll have it so;
 The only Way to ease our Discontents,
 Is to conclude they must be such Events;
 Such as the mighty hidden source of Things,
 Bubbles from it's inevitable Springs.
