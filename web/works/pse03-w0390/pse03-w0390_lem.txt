the fatality.

come all you grand predestinarian now,
 your doctrine to the height i will allow:
 i who with utmost force resist my fate,
 but be to ill alone predestinate;
 in vain i strive the immutable decree,
 have pass on my unlucky destiny. 
with sigh and tear i do at first begin,
 to conquer fate as other will their sin;
 each path i tread i go with caution on,
 but every step do lead to be undo:
 and when a threaten storm be in my view,
 i from it (wise as i think) withdraw;
 but while the approach ill with fear i shun,
 into some other certain harm i run;
 so when some mighty grief do press my soul,
 i will the uneasy tyranny control;
 (like a distract man that will not bear,
 those fetter which discretion make he wear;
 but fret and rave, and break the friendly chain,
 which do from great injury restrain;
 he will not be bare a dangerous liberty,
 though he to outrage and mischief fly.) 
thus i from one misfortune force my way,
 by mean that do to great still betray;
 one sorrow seldom attend long on i,
 i have a torture variety,
 i change and change, yet still it be misery. 
a Hydra fate my ruin do pursue,
 cut off one ill, strait, there spring up a new,
 and they will arise ad infinitum too. 
there be none the mystic scroll of fate can read,
 nor shun the ill by mighty power decree,
 hoodwinked by they, just as they guide we tread. 
in vain we say we this or that will do,
 it can be unless they will have it so;
 the only way to ease our discontent,
 be to conclude they must be such event;
 such as the mighty hide source of thing,
 bubble from it be inevitable spring.
