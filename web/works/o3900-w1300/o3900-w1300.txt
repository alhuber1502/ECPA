HYMN for the EPIPHANY.

I.

SONS of Men, behold from far
 Hail the long-expected Star! 
Jacob's Star that gilds the Night,
 Guides bewilder'd Nature right. 

II.

Fear not hence that Ill should flow,
 Wars or Pestilence below,
 Wars it bids and Tumults cease,
 Ushering in the Prince of Peace. 

III.

Mild He shines on all beneath,
 Piercing thro' the Shade of Death,
 Scatt'ring Error's wide-spread Night,
 Kindling Darkness into Light. 

IV.

Nations all, far off and near,
 Haste to see your GOD appear! 
Haste, for Him your Hearts prepare,
 Meet him manifested there! 

V.

There behold the Day-spring rise,
 Pouring Eye-sight on your Eyes,
 GOD in his own Light survey,
 Shining to the Perfect Day. 

VI.

Sing, ye Morning Stars again,
 GOD descends on Earth to reign,
 Deigns for Man his Life t' employ;
 Shout, ye Sons of GOD, for Joy!
