hymn for the Epiphany.

i 

son of man, behold from far
 hail the long-expected star! 
Jacob star that gild the night,
 guide bewilder nature right. 

ii.

fear not hence that ill shall flow,
 war or pestilence below,
 war it bid and tumult cease,
 usher in the prince of peace. 

iii.

mild he shine on all beneath,
 pierce through the shade of death,
 scatter error widespread night,
 kindle darkness into light. 

iv.

nation all, far off and near,
 haste to see your god appear! 
haste, for he your heart prepare,
 meet he manifest there! 

v. 

there behold the day-spring rise,
 pour eye-sight on your eye,
 god in his own light survey,
 shine to the perfect day. 

vi.

sing, you morning star again,
 god descend on earth to reign,
 deign for man his life to employ;
 shout, you son of god, for joy!
