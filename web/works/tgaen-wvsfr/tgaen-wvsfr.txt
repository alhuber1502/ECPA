[Verse Fragments]

Gratitude

The Joy that trembles in her eye
She bows her meek & humble head
[...] in silent praise
[...] beyond the power of Sound.

(Mr Pope dead)

[...] and smart beneath the visionary scourge
â€” 'tis Ridicule & not reproach that wounds
Their vanity & not their conscience feels

A few shall [...]
The cadence of my song repeat
& hail thee in my words.
