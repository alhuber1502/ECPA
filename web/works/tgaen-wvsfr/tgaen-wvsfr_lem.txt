[verse fragment]

gratitude

the joy that tremble in her eye
she bow her meek and humble head
[...] in silent praise
[...] beyond the power of sound.

(mr. pope dead)

[...] and smart beneath the visionary scourge
â€” it be ridicule and not reproach that wound
their vanity and not their conscience feel

a few shall [...]
the cadence of my song repeat
and hail thou in my word.
