song i

'midst beauty and pleasure gay triumph, to languish
and droop without know the source of my anguish;
to start from short slumber and look for the morning â€”
yet close my dull eye when i see it return;

sigh sudden and frequent, look ever deject,
sound that steal from my tongue, by no meaning connect!
ah say, fellow-swain, how these symptom befall i?
they smile, but reply not. sure Delia will tell i!
