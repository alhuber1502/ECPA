THE NIGHTINGALE AND GLOW-WORM.

A Nightingale that all day long
 Had cheer'd the village with his song,
 Nor yet at eve his note suspended,
 Nor yet when even tide was ended,
 Began to feel as well he might
 The keen demands of appetite;
 When looking eagerly around,
 He spied far off upon the ground,
 A something shining in the dark,
 And knew the glow-worm by his spark,
 So stooping down from hawthorn top,
 He thought to put him in his crop;
 The worm aware of his intent,
 Harangu'd him thus right eloquent. 
Did you admire my lamp, quoth he,
 As much as I your minstrelsy,
 You would abhor to do me wrong,
 As much as I to spoil your song,
 For 'twas the self-same power divine,
 Taught you to sing, and me to shine,
 That you with music, I with light,
 Might beautify and cheer the night. 
The songster heard his short oration,
 And warbling out his approbation,
 Releas'd him as my story tells,
 And found a supper somewhere else. 
Hence jarring sectaries may learn,
 Their real int'rest to discern:
 That brother should not war with brother,
 And worry and devour each other,
 But sing and shine by sweet consent,
 'Till life's poor transient night is spent,
 Respecting in each other's case
 The gifts of nature and of grace. 
Those christians best deserve the name
 Who studiously make peace their aim;
 Peace, both the duty and the prize
 Of him that creeps and him that flies.
