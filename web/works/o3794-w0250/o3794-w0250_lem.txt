the nightingale and glow-worm.

a nightingale that all day long
 have cheere the village with his song,
 nor yet at eve his note suspend,
 nor yet when even tide be end,
 begin to feel as well he may
 the keen demand of appetite;
 when look eager around,
 he spy far off upon the ground,
 a something shine in the dark,
 and know the glowworm by his spark,
 so stoop down from hawthorn top,
 he think to put he in his crop;
 the worm aware of his intent,
 harangue he thus right eloquent. 
do you admire my lamp, quoth he,
 as much as i your minstrelsy,
 you will abhor to do i wrong,
 as much as i to spoil your song,
 for it be the self-same power divine,
 teach you to sing, and i to shine,
 that you with music, i with light,
 may beautify and cheer the night. 
the songster hear his short oration,
 and warble out his approbation,
 release he as my story tell,
 and find a supper somewhere else. 
hence jar sectary may learn,
 their real interest to discern:
 that brother shall not war with brother,
 and worry and devour each other,
 but sing and shine by sweet consent,
 until life poor transient night be spend,
 respect in each other case
 the gift of nature and of grace. 
those christian best deserve the name
 who studious make peace their aim;
 peace, both the duty and the prize
 of he that creep and he that fly.
