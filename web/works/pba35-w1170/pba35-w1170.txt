To the Right Honourable the Lady Elizabeth Boyle, Daughter to the Right Honourable John Earl of Orrery, on her Birth-Day, May 7. 1733.

By the Same. 

May each new Year some new Perfection give,
 Till all the Mother in the Daughter live! 
May'st Thou her Virtues to the World restore! 
And be what Henrietta was before! 
And when revolving Years mature thy Charms,
 When Pride of Conquest thy fair Bosom warms,
 May some great Youth, for ev'ry Grace renown'd,
 With Taste and Science bless'd, by Virtue crown'd;
 By Virtue guarded from Ambition's Wiles,
 Superior both to Fortune's Frowns and Smiles;
 Who wears the Honours of a glorious Name,
 Yet to Distinction bears a nobler Claim;
 Like a new Star, in native Lustre bright,
 That boasts no Radiance from reflected Light:
 Allow'd the rising Genius of his Age;
 By ev'ry Excellence thy Heart engage;
 Like Him who bless'd thy Mother's Nuptial State;
 But O! may Heav'n give Thine a longer Date.
