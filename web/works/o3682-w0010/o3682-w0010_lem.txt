the first ode of the four book of Horace:

to Venus.

again? new tumult in my breast? 
ah spare i, Venus! let i, let i rest! 
i be not now, alas! the man
 as in the gentle reign of my queen Anne. 
ah sound no more the soft alarm,
 nor circle sober fifty with thy charm. 
mother too fierce of dear desire! 
turn, turn to will heart your wanton fire. 
to number five direct your dove,
 there spread round M**y all your bloom love;
 noble and young, who strike the heart
 with every sprightly, every decent part;
 equal, the injure to defend,
 to charm the mistress, or to fix the friend. 
he, with a hundred art refine,
 shall stretch thy conquest over half the kind:
 to he each rival shall submit,
 make but his riches equal to his wit. 
then shall thy form the marble grace,
 (thy graecian form) and Chloe lend the face:
 he house, embosom in the grove,
 sacred to social life and social love,
 shall glitter over the pendent green,
 where Thames reflect the visionary scene. 
thither, the silver-sounding lyre
 shall call the smile love, and young desire;
 there, every grace and muse shall throng,
 exalt the dance, or animate the song;
 there, youth and nymph, in consort gay,
 shall hail the rise, close the part day. 
with i, alas! those joy be over;
 for i, the vernal Garland bloom no more. 
adieu! fond hope of mutual fire,
 the still-believing, still-renewed desire;
 adieu! the heart-expanding bowl,
 and all the kind deceiver of the soul!
 â€” but why? ah tell i, ah too dear! 
steal down my cheek involuntary tear? 
why word so flow, thought so free,
 stop, or turn nonsense at one glance of thou? 
thou, dress in fancy airy beam,
 absent i follow through the extend dream,
 now, now i seize, i clasp thy charm,
 and now you burst, (ah cruel!) from my arm,
 and swift shoot along the Mall,
 or soft glide by the canal,
 now show by cynthia silver ray,
 and now, on roll water snatch away.
