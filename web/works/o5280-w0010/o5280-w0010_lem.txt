RUMORA; or, the maid of raasa.

raasa, by thy rocky shore,
 vocal to the ocean roar,
 cliff, that have for age stand
 barrier to the briny flood,
 beneath your dark, your dismal shade,
 wander weep a woe-worn maid,
 while the pause of the gale
 each she fill with sorrow tale. 

burst from the sable sky,
 see the fork lightning fly,
 while their sad destructive light
 gild awhile the gloom of night! 
tremble to the blast that blow,
 gaze on the gulph below,
 yield to the ruthless storm,
 droop mark yond angel form,
 round who face divine fair
 loose stream her golden hair! 
to the rock sublime seat
 fate have lead her wander foot;
 yawn wide the greedy deep
 woo she to eternal sleep. 

by the lightning vivid glare
 see you not yond frantic stare? 
by the tempest lurid light,
 mark she plunge to endless night! 
struggle amid the boil wave,
 nature, fright at the grave,
 to the rude, the rocky strand
 faint point her languid hand. 
cease, you blast, awhile to blow,
 drown not now the wail of woe! 
hear you not yond pierce groan
 that proclaim her spirit fly? 
while it soar on seraph wing,
 roar wave her requiem sing. 

still, by raasa sea-girt shore,
 blue-eyed maid her fate deplore;
 from the cliff sublime and steep
 cast thy garland in the deep,
 mark thus the day return,
 still rumora fate they mourn.
