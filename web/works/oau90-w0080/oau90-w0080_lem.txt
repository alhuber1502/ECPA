a true tale of a true intrigue.

dark be the night, and not a star
be see over all the hemisphere,
when late muse all alone
i ramble to a country town,
to heal with balmy love my breast,
that have with grief be long oppress;
for there two beauteous sister shine,
as bright as the rejoice moon,
when she with full contentment cloy,
endimion in eclipse enjoy.
young as the spring, as sweet they smell,
and soft as down of swan they feel;
and i transport with delight,
can boast my self chief favourite.
oh happiness! too fierce to taste,
oh pleasure! too refine to last;
it be by the change, we always see
the curse of our mortality:
the one be fair as the first maid,
that once for fruit the world betray,
a rosy cheek, and such a skin,
as well may give excuse for sin;
if sin be possible to be
enclose in such divinity;
the other be of brown hew,
yet the more charm of the two;
a shape divine, and sparkle eye,
her foot, her leg, her taper thigh,
her breast, where king will wish to lie,
show the soft path to kill joy:
a solid beauty, that will last,
smooth, plump, and fit to be embrace;
full of delight, as beauty queen
in pleasure bloom at eighteen;
down her soft neck her flow hair,
the best adornment of the fair,
with lavish bounty reach her knee,
discover nature luxury.
all grace which historian find,
in book adorn womankind,
in these two charm creature shine,
admire by all, excel by none.
forgive i, if for beauty sake,
i this prolix digression make;
since those that of its power have proof,
can never speak its praise enough.
know then, olinda, and cephise
be name these lovely goddess,
a treasure dear than the fleece,
lock in the old Hesperides;
and by as strange a dragon keep,
a mouldy aunt that never sleep.
but love that sound out a device
to blind the giant hundred eye,
when Iove in io snare do fall,
cloy with embrace conjugal;
soon send a Hermes to my aid,
who teach i how to bribe her maid.
she have in that happy town
a constant Roger of her own,
keep our intrigue the more unknown.
and often open paradise,
than ever saint Peter with his key,
such power have praise with profit join
to charm a mercenary mind.
suppose i then close by the door,
through which i often go before,
give a sign to let they know
a faithful lover be below;
for both be of my heart possess,
and have by turn chief interest,
the brown, when the other be not there,
and when brown absent be, the fair,
thus great, thus turk-like do i rove
in my seraglio of love.

scarce i the sign have thorough make,
but word be bring they be in bed,
and the old aunt lock up at prayer
for blessing on her house affair.
then while i soft scale the stair,
the trusty wench with busy broom
below, be scrub round the room,
sing the old song of Troy betray,
to hide the creek noise i make,
darkness over all the world do sway,
yet lead by love i find the way
to the side where sweet olinda lie:
who charm eye in spite of night,
like diamond shine with glitter light,
and ere she can my welcome speak
her arm be twist round my neck,
while i a thousand kiss steal,
and every kiss be worth a soul,
nor do her sister less employ
her love, but with a grumble joy,
child i for my undecent crime
of venture thither at that time.
i, modest excuse make,
with all the move word i have,
tell she it be a great crime
to let my love be slave to time,
all time for lover be most fit,
when ever they can admission get;
and thus with some few fallacy,
and tender that i think will please,
all scruple thorough satisfy,
i lay i by olinda side.

but first my dirty shoe from foot
i pull, lest they shall daub the sheet,
and that it never shall be say
a man in his breech want to bed,
i steal they off without offence
to dear olinda innocence:
who struggle betwixt shame and love
to make a faint resistance strive,
then like a eager love fop,
no petruke on nor e'r a cap,
i cling to that soft angel side,
close as a bridegroom to his bride.

great Ovid in his mighty verse
of Hermes, a strange tale declare,
how he to Aphrodite incline,
so fervent their body join.
howe'r that fancy may be false,
as there be no certain truth in tale;
it be here confirm, for we that night
make out the true hermaphrodite.
here i can wish the reader thought
will not proceed into a fault,
by censure this extravagance,
as far as the extreme offence,
love do a thousand folly own,
that may be proper to be show,
and yet the great not be do.
nor will i have he seek what past
between we more, but think the best;
while i to write my muse employ
what discontent ensue this joy.

the morning rise as fair as when
in flowery Eden, spring begin
to bless the first create man:
Aurora blush to be outdo
by the gay splendour of the sun,
and coily his embrace do shun;
while he a hot and vigorous woer
mount his bright chariot to pursue she:
when i from sleep my fence draw,
and bless as he my self i view,
for i have my Aurora too;
who whisper soft as she can,
her story in my bosom tell,
and blush, my desire reprove
with all the tenderness of love;
i rapt with such a load of charm,
take the dear trembler in my arm,
and swear no storm of fate shall move
the rock of my eternal love:
a thousand time her eye i kiss,
ten thousand more her snowy breast;
and so unruly be our joy,
her sister waken with the noise;
who with her wit our pleasure grace
in rally on adventure past.

but see what mutability
attend on transitory joy,
and what a slender film do grow
between extreme of mirth and woe,
as we of past intrigue confer
unchecked, and as we think unheard.
old Satan ready to devour,
stand listen at the chamber door;
the aunt have in her early head
some nice occasion for her maid,
and fear she shall wake my dear
to call she soft creep up stair;
where soon she hear their tattle noise,
mix with my loud bass-viol voice.
not more amaze lame Vulcan stand
when he behold his wife be lewd;
nor Cesar, who as story show
see his fond girl her fame expose
to the poet with the roman nose.
then be old grannum at that sound,
that through her ear her heart do wound;
sting with a rage from wonder breed,
with speed she hobble to the bed;
but not so soon, but first i slip
from the outside between they creep,
where close the pant lover lie,
half smother with soft leg and thigh;
the curtain straight she open throw
expose the poor girl to view,
and there not find what she look,
under the bed with broomstick poke,
then ghastly round the room she rowl
peep in all the chink and hole.
olinda tremble at her sight,
and almost murder with the fright,
raise herself in bed upright,
and bold on my reek face
set without complement she Aâ€”
press i down so close beneath,
that i have much ado to breath;
so warm a place have case my nose,
no mask sit ever on so close,
nor do my mouth at that time miss
in corner a dear friend to kiss,
while round i nothing seem to be,
but region of obscurity.

bless i, think i, sure i be now
descend to the shade below,
but can want the golden bough,
my bold adventure step to guide,
as once the great Aeneas do;
for there the Sybil stand again,
and here be the grove just by my chin,
a Copps with fine thick bush dress,
where flutter love do build their nest;
nor need i Styx or Cerberus fear,
when that my passport be so near.

my fancy with these thought grow big,
i reach my hand to pull a twig,
when by some angry demon spite
i find my self bring back to light,
for that old hag with rage overcome,
discover nothing in the room;
and know too too well the voice,
to think the devil make that noise,
not heed what her niece say,
pull all the clothes from off the bed,
and show three pair of leg as bare,
as first they to the midwife be.

have you not in a quarry see
a peasant that with culter keen
have dig beneath some hollow stone,
and find a nest of snake well grow,
crawl and twist all in one:
so cluster in a knot we lie
broad expose to open day.

imagine now you view the scene,
two plump white bum my nose between,
that from the motion of their fear
have send out a ungrateful air,
the aunt with patience not endow,
ready to baul for aid a loud,
when in my shirt from both i slip,
and to the stun old woman leap,
swear, if from the place she stir,
she shall not live to speak a word;
then do like man of honour try
to face it with a ready lye,
swear like any popish monk,
that i last night come thither drink,
and that her niece be as free
from guilt, as at there infancy,
confirm this with vow and oath,
still hasten to slip on my clothes,
which do, i scamper out of door,
where i can never enter more.
