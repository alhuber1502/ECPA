by a person of quality. 

remote from strife, from urban throng, and noise. 
here dwell my soul amid domestic joy:
 no rattle coach serious thought annoy;
 nor busy prate fool my peace destroy:
 wrap up in all the sweet of rural ease,
 my great creator work my sense please. 
the mind, in peaceful solitude, have room
 to range in thought, and ramble far from home,
 other may court the joy which prince give,
 while i, in sacred silence, true live.
