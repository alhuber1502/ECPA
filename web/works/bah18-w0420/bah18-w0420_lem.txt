song.

in airy dream fond fancy fly,
 my absent love to see,
 and with the early dawn i rise,
 dear youth, to think of thou. 

how swift fly the rosy hour,
 when hope and love be new;
 sweet be the time, as open flower,
 but, ah! it be transient too. 

the moment now move slow on,
 until thy wish return;
 i count they, pensive and alone,
 as in the shade i mourn. 

return, return, my love, and charm
 each anxious care to rest;
 thy voice shall every doubt disarm,
 and sooth my trouble breast.
