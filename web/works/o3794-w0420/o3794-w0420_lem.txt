the poet, the oyster, and sensitive plant.

a oyster cast upon the shore
 be hear, though never hear before;
 complain in a speech well word,
 and worthy thus to be record:
 ah hapless wretch! condemn to dwell
 for ever in my native shell,
 ordain to move when other please,
 not for my own content or ease,
 but toss and buffet about,
 now in the water, and now out. 
it be better to be bear a stone
 of rude shape and feeling none,
 than with a tenderness like i,
 and sensibility so fine;
 i envy that unfeeling shrub,
 fast-rooted against every rub. 
the plant he mean grow not far off,
 and feel the sneer with scorn enough,
 be hurt, disgust, mortify,
 and with asperity reply. 
when cry the botanist, and stare,
 do plant call sensitive grow there? 
no matter when — a poet muse be
 to make they grow just where she choose. 
you shapeless nothing in a dish,
 you that be but almost a fish,
 i scorn your coarse insinuation,
 and have most plentiful occasion
 to wish myself the rock i view,
 or such another dolt as you. 
for many a grave and learned clerk,
 and many a gay unlettered spark,
 with curious touch examine i,
 if i can feel as well as he;
 and when i bend, retire and shrink,
 say, well — it be more than one will think —
 thus life be spend, oh fie upo! 
in be touch, and cry, do. 
a poet in his evening walk,
 overhear and check this idle talk. 
and your fine sense, he say, and you,
 whatever evil it endure,
 deserve not, if so soon offend,
 much to be pity or commend. 
dispute though short, be far too long,
 where both alike be in the wrong;
 your feeling in their full amount,
 be all upon your own account. 
you in your grotto-work enclose
 complain of be thus expose,
 yet nothing feel in that rough coat,
 save when the knife be at your throat,
 wherever drive by wind or tide,
 exempt from every ill beside. 
and as for you, my lady squeamish,
 who reckon every touch a blemish,
 if all the plant that can be find
 embellish the scene around,
 shall droop and wither where they grow,
 you will not feel at all, not you. 
the noble mind their virtue prove
 by pity, sympathy, and love,
 these, these be feeling true fine,
 and prove their owner half divine. 
his censure reach they as he deal it,
 and each by shrink show he feel it.
