Hans Carvel.

Hans Carvel, impotent and old,
 marry a lass of London mould:
 handsome? enough; extreme gay:
 love music, company, and play:
 high flight she have, and wit at will:
 and so her tongue lie seldom still:
 for in all visit who but she,
 to argue, or to repartee? 

she make it plain, that human passion
 be order by predestination;
 that, if weak woman go astray,
 their star be more in fault than they:
 whole tragedy she have by heart;
 enter into roxana part:
 to triumph in her rival blood,
 the action certain be good. 
how like a vine young Ammon curl! 
oh that dear conqueror of the world! 
she pity Betterton in age,
 that ridicule the god-like rage. 

she, first of all the town, be tell,
 where new India thing be sell:
 so in a morning, without bodice,
 slip sometime out to mrs. thody;
 to cheapen tea, to buy a screen:
 what else can so much virtue mean? 
for to prevent the least reproach,
 Betty go with she in the coach. 

but when no very great affair
 excite her peculiar care;
 she without fail be wake at ten;
 drink chocolate, then sleep again:
 at twelve she rise: with much ado
 her clothes be huddle on by two:
 then; do my lady dine at home? 
yes sure; — but be the colonel come? 
next, how to spend the afternoon,
 and not come home again too soon;
 the change, the city, or the play,
 as each be proper for the day;
 a turn in summer to Hyde-Park,
 when it grow tolerable dark. 

wife pleasure cause husband pain:
 strange fancy come in han brain:
 he think of what he do not name;
 and will reform; but dare not blame. 
at first he therefore preach his wife
 the comfort of a pious life:
 tell she, how transient beauty be;
 that all must die, and flesh be grass:
 he buy her sermon, psalm, and grace;
 and double down the useful place. 
but still the weight of worldly care
 allow her little time for prayer:
 and Cleopatra be read over,
 while Scot, and wake, and twenty more,
 that teach one to deny one self,
 stand unmolested on the shelf. 
a untouched bible grace her toilet:
 no fear that thumb of she shall spoil it. 
in short, the trade be still the same:
 the dame go out: the colonel come. 

what be to be do? poor Carvel cry:
 another battery must be try:
 what if to spell i have recourse? 
it be but to hinder something worse. 
the end must justifié the mean:
 he only sin who ill intend:
 since therefore it be to combat evil;
 it be lawful to employ the devil. 

forthwith the devil do appear
 (for name he and he be always near)
 not in the shape in which he ply
 at miss elbow when she lie;
 or stand before the nursery door,
 to take the naughty boy that roar:
 but without saucer eye or claw,
 like a grave barrister at law. 

Hans Carvel, lie aside your grief,
 the devil say: i bring relief. 
relief, say Hans: pray let i crave
 your name, sir. — Satan. — sir, your slave:
 i do not look upon your foot:
 you will pardon i: — ay, now i see:
 and pray, sir, when come you from hell? 
our friend there, do you leave they well? 
all well: but prithee, honest Hans,
 (say Satan) leave your complaisance:
 the truth be this: i can stay
 flare in sunshine all the day:
 for, entre nous, we hellish sprite,
 love more the fresco of the night;
 and often our receipt convey
 in dream, than any other way. 
i tell you therefore as a friend,
 ever morning dawn, your fear shall end:
 go then this evening, master Carvel,
 lay down your fowl, and broach your barrel;
 let friend and wine dissolve your care;
 while i the great receipt prepare:
 to night i will bring it, by my faith;
 believe for once what Satan say. 

away go Hans: glad? not a little;
 obey the devil to a tittle;
 invite friend some half a dozen,
 the colonel, and my lady cousin. 
the meat be serve; the bowl be crown;
 catch be sing; and health go round:
 Barbadoes Waters for the close;
 until Hans have fair get his dose:
 the colonel toast to the best:
 the dame move off, to be undress:
 the chime go twelve: the guest withdraw:
 but when, or how, Hans hardly know. 
some modern anecdote aver,
 he nod in his elbow chair;
 from thence be carry off to bed:
 John hold his heel, and nan his head. 
my lady be disturb: new sorrow! 
which Hans must answer for to morrow. 

in bed then view this happy pair;
 and think how HYMEN triumph there. 
Hans, fast asleep, as soon as lay;
 the duty of the night unpaid:
 the wake dame, with thought oppress,
 that make her hate both he and rest:
 by such a husband, such a wife! 
it be acme and septimius life. 
the lady sigh: the lover snore:
 the punctual devil keep his word:
 appear to honest Hans again;
 but not at all by madam see:
 and give he a magic ring,
 fit for the finger of a king;
 dear Hans, say he, this jewel take,
 and wear it long for Satan sake:
 it will do your business to a hair:
 for long as you this ring shall wear,
 as sure as i look over Lincoln,
 that never shall happen which you think on. 

Hans take the ring with joy extreme;
 (all this be only in a dream)
 and thrust it beyond his joint,
 it be do, he cry: i have gain my point. —
 what point, say she, you ugly beast? 
you neither give i joy nor rest:
 it be do. — what be do, you drunken bear? 
you have thrust your finger g—d know where.
