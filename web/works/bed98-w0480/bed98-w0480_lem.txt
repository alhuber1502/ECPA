the question.

may those who dress each future year,
with fairy scene of promise joy,
let fame and glitter fortune hear,
and feel the magic they employ.

while i with humble hope and power,
will seek a unaspiring theme,
that point i out no golden hour,
nor oft inspire the poet dream.

say what be that, where full give
nought else its owner can possess?
but never shall it be in heaven,
and none its name shall ever bless.

yet be it not despise of heaven,
which ought its misery still to cheer,
for to the son of god it be give
and be his constant portion here.

it faint beneath the torrid sun,
and shiver in the northern snow;
and shall it weary labour shun,
must soon, alas! in death repose.

beneath the scourge, and unredressed,
it sink into the grave it delve;
but briton though of this possess,
yet ever may possess themselves

indifference dwell for ever near,
all charm it vain will apply;
its wisdom seldom gain the ear,
nor oft its beauty win the eye.

if in the shift of the scene,
o poverty? i thou shall know,
it will sure soothe some pang within,
that i have feel for other woe.

you poor, yet brother! fellow clay!
and in our common nature bind,
oh! may the rich attention pay,
wherever your simple history find.

oh! be they to your virtue kind,
your woe their pity ever gain,
your error, may their candour find,
remember you, as they, be man.
