FOR The Plan of a Fountain,

On which is The Effigies of the Queen on a Triumphal Arch, The Figure of the Duke of Marlborough, beneath, and The Chief Rivers of the World round the whole Work.

Ye active Streams, where-e'er your Waters flow,
 Let distant Climes and furthest Nations know,
 What Ye from Thames and Danube have been taught,
 How Anne Commanded, and how Marlbr√¥ Fought.
