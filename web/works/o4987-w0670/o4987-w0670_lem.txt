the hospitable Oake.

by —.

erst in arcadia land much praise be find,
 a lusty tree far rear toward the sky,
 sacred to Jove, and place on high ground,
 beneath who shade do gladsome shepherd hie,
 meet plenteous good, and oft be wont to shun
 bleak winter drizzle, summer parch sun. 

outstretch in all the luxury of ease
 they pluck rich mistletoe of virtue rare;
 their lip be tempt by each kindly breeze,
 that wave the branch to proffer acorn fair;
 while out the hollow root, with sweet inlay,
 the murmur bee her dainty hoard betray. 

the fearless bird safe bosom here its nest,
 its sturdy side do brave the nip wind,
 where many a creep ewe may glad rest;
 warm comfort here to all and every kind;
 where hunge the leaf well sprint with honey dew,
 whence drop their cup, the gambol fairie know. 

but ah! in luckless day what mischief begin
 midst fell debate, and madden revelry,
 when tipsy Bacchus have bewitch Pan,
 for sober swain so thankless never may be;
 though pass strange — it be bruit all around,
 this goodly tree do shadow too much grind. 

with much despite they aim its overthrow,
 and sorry jest its wonted gift deride,
 how snare birdlime make of mistletoe;
 nor trust their flock to shelter beneath its side;
 it drop chill venom on our ewe, they cry,
 and subtle serpent at its root do lie. 

eftsoon the axe do rear its deadly blow,
 around do echo bear each labour stroke;
 now to the grind its lofty head do bow,
 then angry Jove aloud in thunder speak. 
on high Olympus next my tree i will place,
 heaven still unscan by such ungrateful race.
