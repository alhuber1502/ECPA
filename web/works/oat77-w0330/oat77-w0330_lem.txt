the ingrate.

dull mortal with the same preposterous breath
we bless love dart, and curse the shaft of death. 
the author of our ill, a god we stile;
but the redresser of those wrong revile.
yet gentle death (though rude treat) still
persist in generous charity to kill
and cure th'ingrateful even against their will!
ah shall he once in just resentment give
our wish, and permit we ever live,
what shall we do when soul and body jar
and loath each other like a ill-wed pair? 
can envious fiend a penalty invent
that shall than loathe embrace more torment?
but friendly death absolve we from this curse,
and when the party clash, make a divorce.
