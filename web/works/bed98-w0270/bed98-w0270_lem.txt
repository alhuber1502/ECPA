write at W. C.  in October,

at sunset

grateful to i this calm retreat,
by fond remembrance dear;
with joy i hail my rural seat,
for peace and love be here.

from scene more change, as these i trace,
to memory record true:
reflection throw a soft grace,
over every rise view.

no more befriend by thy shade,
thou fast decline oak,
our simple banquet shall be make,
or pass our harmless joke.

you rock in antic form you rise,
and flowery garland wear;
but stray by your fringe brow,
i meet my friend no more.

nor yond fantastic thorn beneath,
their mossy seat i share;
or tread with they the velvet heath,
and gather floweret there.

no more, regret friend, to you,
the vary moss i bring;
or craneberry, or berry blue,
from out the purple ling.

as yonder western height between,
deep flood of water glide,
rich autumn paint sky be see,
reflect on their tide.

nor charm alas! delight their eye,
this set sun reveal;
though clear wild cambria mountain rise,
and mona magic hill.

nor mirthful now they hear i say,
i tread that fairy ground,
and there with youthful elf so gay,
have dance the frolic round.

now silver cloghow sable vest,
the full orb moon appear,
and on each floweret tender breast,
hang sympathetic tear.

decline autumn yield her sheaf,
you fade scene farewell!
i will return, with flower and leave
a while with you to dwell.

as winter will each charm deform,
thou overhang rock;
oh! from the ravage of the storm
defend my favourite oak.

though care perhaps, and grief i seek,
bid peace and you adieu;
what shake the strong, may spare the weak
and i revisit you.
