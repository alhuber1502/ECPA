the garland.

i 

the pride of every grove i choose,
 the violet sweet, and Lilly fair,
 the dapple pink, and blush rose,
 to deck my charm cloe hair. 

ii.

at morn the nymph vouchsafe to place
 upon her brow the various wreathe;
 the flower less bloom than her face,
 the scent less fragrant than her breath. 

iii.

the flower she wear along the day:
 and every nymph and shepherd say,
 that in her hair they look more gay,
 than glow in their native bed. 

iv.

undress at evening, when she find
 their odour lose, their colour past;
 she change she look, and on the ground
 her garland and her eye she cast. 

v. 

that eye drop sense distinct and clear,
 as any muse tongue can speak;
 when from it be lid a pearly tear
 run trickle down her beauteous cheek. 

vi.

dissemble, what i know too well,
 my love, my life, say i, explain
 this change of humour: prithee tell:
 that fall tear â€” what do it mean? 

vii.

she sigh; she smile: and to the flower
 point, the lovely moralist say:
 see! friend, in some few fleet hour,
 see yonder, what a change be make. 

viii.

ah i! the bloom pride of may,
 and that of beauty be but one:
 at morn both flourish bright and gay,
 both fade at evening, pale, and go. 

ix.

at dawn poor Stella dance and sing;
 the amorous youth around her bow:
 at night her fatal knell be ring;
 i see, and kiss she in her shroud. 

x. 

such as she be, who die to day;
 such i, alas! may be to morrow:
 go, Damon, bid thy muse display
 the justice of thy cloe sorrow.
