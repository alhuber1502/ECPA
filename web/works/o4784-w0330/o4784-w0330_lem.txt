Cupid and folly. 

imitate from the french. 

Cupid, ere deprive of sight,
 young and apt for all delight,
 meet with folly on the way,
 as idle, and as fond of play. 
in gay sport the time they pass;
 now run, now wrestle on the grass;
 their paint wing then nimble ply,
 and every way for mastery try:
 until a contest do his arise,
 who have win the appoint prize. 
gentle love refer the case
 to the next, that come in place;
 trust to his flatter wile,
 and soften the dispute with smile. 
but folly, who no temper know,
 word pursue with hot blow:
 until the eye of love be lose,
 which have such pain to mortal cost. 
Venus hear his mournful cry,
 and repeat they, in the sky,
 to Jupiter in council set,
 with peer for the occasion meet;
 in her arm the boy she bear,
 bathe he in fall tear;
 and while his want of eye be show,
 secure the judge by her own. 
folly to the board must come,
 and hear the trial and the doom;
 which cytherea loud pray
 may be as heavy as the case:
 which, when all be just weigh,
 Cupid wing now useless make,
 that a staff, his foot must guide,
 which will still be apt to slide;
 this decree at last be read,
 that love by folly shall be lead.
