song. to Lerinda.

cease, dear Lerinda, cease admire
why croud and noise i disapprove;
what ever i see abroad be tire;
o let we to some cell remove;
where all alone our self enjoy,
enrich with innocence and peace,
on noble theme our thought employ,
let we our inward joy increase:
and still the happy taste pursue,
raise our love and friendship high,
and thus the sacred flame renew,
in ecstasy of bliss expire.
