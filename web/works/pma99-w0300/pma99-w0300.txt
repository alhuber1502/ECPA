FROM THE XIITH CHAPTER OF ST. MARK, 41ST VERSE, TO THE END.

Hail, widow! ample cause hast thou to bless
 That happy state, which others term distress,
 Since by thy Saviour's voice it is proclaim'd,
 That wheresoe'er his gospel shall be nam'd,
 There shall recorded stand thy pious deed,
 The mite bestow'd of which thyself had need. 
Such was thy charity, thy faith, thy love,
 The gift was register'd in heay'n above. 
What tho' the rich, whose coffers overflow'd,
 With oftentation their vain alms bestow'd,
 'Twas but a part from that abundance given,
 Which they as almoners receiv'd from heaven,
 Thou from thine all with confidence didst part,
 Unknown to thee, thy Saviour saw thy heart.
