To be sung at WORK.

I.

SON of the Carpenter, receive
 This humble Work of mine;
 Worth to my meanest Labour give,
 By joining it to thine. 

II.

Servant of all, to toil for Man
 Thou wou'dst not, LORD, refuse:
 Thy Majesty did not disdain
 To be employ'd for us. 

III.

Thy bright Example I pursue
 To Thee in all things rise,
 And all I think, or speak, or do,
 Is one great Sacrifice. 

IV.

Careless thro' outwards Cares I go,
 From all Distraction free:
 My Hands are but engag'd below,
 My Heart is still with Thee. 

V.

O when wilt Thou my Life appear! 
How gladly would I cry:
 'Tis done, the Work thou gav'st one here,
 'Tis finish'd LORD â€” and die.
