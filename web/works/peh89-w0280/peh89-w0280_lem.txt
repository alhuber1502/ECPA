the widower courtship.

Roger a doleful widower,
 full eighteen week have be,
 when he, to meet the milkmaid Nell,
 come smile over the green. 

blithe as a lad of seventeen,
 he thus accost Nell;
 give i your pail, i will carry it
 for you, if you think well. 

say Nell, indeed my milking-pail
 you shall not touch, i vow;
 i have carry it myself before,
 and i can carry it now. 

so side by side they walk awhile,
 then he at last do say;
 my inclination be to come
 and see you, if i may. 

Nell understand his meaning well,
 and brisk answer she;
 you may see i at any time,
 if you look where i be. 

say he, but hear i yet awhile,
 i have something more to tell;
 i glad will a sweetheart be
 unto you, mistress Nell. 

a sweetheart i do want, say Nell,
 kind sir, and if you do,
 another you may seek, for i
 be not the lass for you. 

when she have make he this reply,
 he will nothing more to say
 but â€” Nelly, a good night to you,
 and homeward go his way.
