in the search of good humour.

in the search of good humour i have ramble all day,
 and just now honest truth have discover her way;
 when rub his telescope perfect clear,
 call out, "i have find she;" and bid i come here. 

i be grow weary of wit, who but dress for show,
 and strive still to sparkle as much as your beau;
 for, if he can shine, though at dear friend expense,
 he will raise contribution on feeling and sense. 

then learning be proud, nor can trifle with ease,
 though in this little life it be oft trifle that please;
 unbending austerity, wrap up in self,
 be so like a miser when hoard his pelf. 

strong reason a warrior that fight out his way,
 and seldom have leisure to rest or to play;
 nay, so rough have he grow, unless great thing be do,
 he think that all useless go down the bright sun. 

o! it be gentle good humour that make life so sweet,
 and pick up the floweret that garnish our foot;
 then, from they extract the balsam of health,
 turn the blossom of nature to true sterling wealth.
