the brass-pot, and stone-jugg. 

a fable. 

a brazen pot, by scour vex,
 with beef and pudding still perplex,
 resolve to attempt a noble life,
 urge the jug to share the strife:
 brother, quoth he, (love to endear)
 why shall we two continue here,
 to serve and cook such homely cheer? 
who though we move with awkward pace,
 your stony bowel, and my face,
 abroad can miss of wealth and place. 
then let we instant by go,
 and see what in the world be do. 
the bloat jug, supine and lazy,
 who make no wish, but to be easy,
 nor, like it be owner, ever do think
 of ought, but to be fill with drink;
 yet something move by this fine story,
 and frothing high with vain-glory,
 reply, he never want metal,
 but have not side, like sturdy kettle,
 that in a croud can shove and bustle,
 and to preferment bear the justle;
 when the first knock will break his measure,
 and stop his rise to place and treasure. 
sure (quoth the pot) thy Scull be thick,
 than ever be thy muddy liquour:
 go i not with thou, for thy guard,
 to take off blow, and danger ward? 
and have thou never hear, that Cully
 be bear through all by dare bully? 
your self (reply the drink-conveigh)
 may be my ruin and betrayer:
 a superiority you boast,
 and dress the meat, i but the toast:
 than mine your constitution strong,
 and in fatigue can hold out long;
 and shall one bang from you be take,
 i into nothing shall be shake. 
a d'autre cry the pot in scorn,
 do think, there be such a villain bear,
 that, when he proffer aid and shelter,
 will rude shall to helter-skelter? 
no more, but follow to the road,
 where each now drag his ponderous load,
 and up the hill be almost clamber,
 when (may it ever be remember!) 
down roll the jug, and after rattle
 the most perfidious of all kettle;
 at every molehill give a jump,
 nor rest, till by obdurate thump,
 the pot of stone, to shiver break,
 send each misguided fool a token:
 to show they, by this fatal test,
 that equal company be best,
 where none oppress, nor be oppress.
