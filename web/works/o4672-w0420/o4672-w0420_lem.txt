to Nathanael Gould ESQ

lawful ambition.

i 

it be not by splendour, or by state,
 majestic mien, or lofty gate
 my muse take measure of a king:
 if wealth or height or bulk will do,
 she call each mountain of Peru
 a more exalt thing. 
frown on i, friend, if ever i boast
 over fellow mind, enslave in clay,
 or swell when i shall have ingross
 a large heap of shine dust,
 and wear a big load of earth than they. 
let the vain world salute i loud,
 my thought look inward, and forget
 the sound name of high and great,
 the flattery of the crowd. 

ii.

when govld command his ship to run
 and search the traffic of the sea,
 his fleet overtake the fall day,
 and bear the western mine away,
 or rich spice from the rise sun:
 while the glad tenant of the shore
 shout and pronounce he Senator,
 yet still the man the same:
 for well the happy merchant know
 the soul with treasure never grow,
 nor swell with airy fame. 

iii.

but trust i Gould, it be lawful pride
 to rise above the mean controul
 of flesh and sense to which we be tie;
 this be ambition that become a soul. 
we steer our course up through the sky,
 farewell this barren land:
 we ken the heavenly shore with long eye,
 there the dear wealth of spirit lie,
 and beckon angel stand.
