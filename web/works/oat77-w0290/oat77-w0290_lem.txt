the disconsolate.

my labour soul no long can sustain,
but sink beneath increase pain;
i wish, contrive, attempt, and rage in vain!
down by these fall spring i will lay
my weary limb, and sigh my trouble soul away!
to these lone field my grief i will impart,
oh my distract head! oh my afflict heart!
put stay, why shall i mournful recite
my grievance, to fright
the feather poet of these stream?
to interrupt their mirth and peace,
while philomel her querulous song shall cease,
and from my sorrow, learn more tragic theam! 
no! no! i will conceal my weighty ill,
seal up my lip, nor loose they even to pray,
but all my plaint in mental prayer convey,
that shall to heaven as silent rise as dew from thence distil.

ii.

dream i? or be it a real prodigy?
for i descry
a rent in that unclouded Skye;
the azure curtain be draw wide
and to my view disclose
the elysian land where happy spirit reside!
see where the spring of pleasure flow,
on who fair bank the bless take soft repose.
exempt from sense or thought of misery,
they sing, and smile, and rove,
and feast on joy in every grove;
their paradise have not forbid tree! 
curse that i be to view this glorious scene
with a vast gulf of air between! 
so from a rock the shipwreck Marriner
survey the distant shore with watery eye,
reflect on the full meal and pastime there,
but have frame his fancy theatre
of sport and rich variety,
sit down disconsolate, and starve dye.
