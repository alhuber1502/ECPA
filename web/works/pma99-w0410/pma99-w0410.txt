A PARODY UPON SWIFT's NURSES' SONG.

Oh my Charley, my Charley,
 The man of the people was he,
 Such a sweet pet as Charley
 No one did ever see. 

 "Once he went up, up, uppy,
 Long he's gone down, down, downy,
 Oft he's gone backwards and forwards,
 And now he's quite run agrouney." 

Has he lost all his credit,
 And has he lost all his money? 
His friends will all make him a purse,
 For he's still their own dear honey. 

Here are his own two Dukies,
 Each with his thousand in handey;
 Here are three Earls and a Marquis,
 And here is his dear Napper Tandy. 

Earl S — pe, as straight as a steeple,
 On the table puts down his five poundy,
 Then drinks to the Man of the People,
 And the glass it goes merrily roundy. 

Next comes his own dear Sh — ry,
 No friend like to Sh — ry on earth,
 A thousand good pounds he subscribes,
 Which is more than poor Sh — ry is worth. 

Then be not discourag'd, dear Charley,
 Your friends are all met in convention,
 Contented to lose their own credit,
 By fixing on you a good pension. 

 "Once he went up, up, uppy,
 Long he's gone down, down, downy,
 Oft he's gone backwards and forwards,
 And now he's quite run agrouney."
