song xix.

against swear, and curse, and take God name in vain.

i 

angel, that high in glory dwell,
 adore thy name, almighty god! 
and devil tremble down in hell,
 beneath the terror of thy rod. 

ii.

and yet how wicked child dare
 abuse thy dreadful glorious name! 
and when they be angry how they swear,
 and curse their fellow, and blaspheme! 

iii.

how will they stand before thy face,
 who treat thou with such disdain,
 while thou shall doom they to the place
 of everlasting fire and pain? 

iv.

then never shall one cool drop
 to quench their burn tongue be give;
 but i will praise thou here and hope
 thus to employ my tongue in heaven. 

v. 

my heart shall be in pain to hear
 wretch affront the lord above;
 it be that great god who power i fear;
 that heavenly father who i love. 

vi.

if my companion grow profane,
 i will leave their friendship, when i hear
 young sinner take thy name in vain,
 and learn to curse and learn to swear.
