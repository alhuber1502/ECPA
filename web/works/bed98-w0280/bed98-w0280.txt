AT THE SAME PLACE.

FROM all that hope and fear between
Corroding cares employ,
I visit thee beloved scene,
And give this day to joy.

From where the east yon mountains crown,
To the smooth western sea,
Each view by summer gaily shown,
The past endears to me.

For perfumed flowers now seated gay,
Did here the cheerless train,
Of desolating winter stray,
And bind with icy chain,

Her frigid hand would lose it's powers,
These beauties to erase;
For the young charms of vernal hours,
Fond memory would replace.

To innocence these scenes invite,
The fragrant air is health;
Unlike the dangerous delight,
That waits on power and wealth.

The herd their flowery carpets share,
And youthful gambols try;
While the plum'd people of the air,
Tune nature's general joy.

E'en rocks has this gay season drest,
With garlands on their brow:
The world too like, a flinty breast,
Lurks in a seemly show.

With youthful hue my favorite tree,
In slender robe array'd;
Extends it's shade again to me,
With thinner foliage spread.

Phebus withdraw that potent ray,
To nobler conquests soar;
Yield it the triumph of to day,
And former day's restore.
