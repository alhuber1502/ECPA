tomorrow.

write during sickness.

how sweet to the heart be the thought of tomorrow,
 when hope fairy picture bright colour display;
 how sweet when we can from futurity borrow
 a balm for the grief which afflict we today! 

when wearisome sickness have teach i to languish
 for health, and the blessing it bear on its wing;
 let i hope (ah! how soon will it lessen my anguish),
 that tomorrow will ease and serenity bring. 

the pilgrim sojourn alone, unbefriended,
 hope, joyful, tomorrow his wander shall cease;
 that at home, and with care sympathetic attend,
 he shall rest unmolested, and slumber in peace. 

when six day of labour each other succeed,
 the husbandman toil with his spirit depress;
 what pleasure to think, as the last be recede,
 tomorrow will be a sweet sabbath of rest! 

and when the vain shadow of time be retire,
 when life be fast fleet, and death be in sight,
 the christian believe, exult, expire,
 behold a tomorrow of endless delight! 

the infidel then see no joyous tomorrow,
 yet he know that his moment must hasten away;
 poor wretch! can he feel without heartrending sorrow,
 that his joy and his life must expire with today!
