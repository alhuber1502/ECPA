hymn to content.

o thou, the nymph with placid eye! 
o seldom find, yet ever nigh! 
receive my temperate vow:
 not all the storm that shake the pole
 can ever disturb thy halcyon soul,
 and smooth unaltered brow. 

o come, in simple vest array,
 with all thy sober cheer display
 to bless my longing sight;
 thy mien compose, thy even pace,
 thy meek regard, thy matron grace,
 and chaste subdue delight. 

no more by vary passion beat,
 o gentle guide my pilgrim foot
 to find thy hermit cell;
 where in some pure and equal sky
 beneath thy soft indulgent eye
 the modest virtue dwell. 

simplicity in attic vest,
 and innocence with candid breast,
 and clear undaunted eye;
 and hope, who point to distant year,
 fair open through this vale of tear
 a vista to the sky. 

there health, through who calm bosom glide
 the temperate joy in even tide,
 that rare ebb or flow;
 and patience there, thy sister meek,
 present her mild, unvary cheek
 to meet the offer blow. 

her influence teach the phrygian sage
 a tyrant master wanton rage
 with settle smile to meet;
 inure to toil and bitter bread
 he bow his meek submit head,
 and kiss thy saint foot. 

but thou, oh nymph retire and coy! 
in what brown hamlet do thou joy
 to tell thy simple tale;
 the lowly child of the ground,
 moss rose, and violet, blossom round,
 and lily of the vale. 

o say what soft propitious hour
 i best may choose to hail thy power,
 and court thy gentle sway? 
when autumn, friendly to the muse,
 shall thy own modest tint diffuse,
 and shed thy mild day. 

when eve, her dewy star beneath,
 thy balmy spirit love to breathe,
 and every storm be lay;
 if such a hour be ever thy choice,
 oft let i hear thy soothe voice
 low whisper through the shade.
