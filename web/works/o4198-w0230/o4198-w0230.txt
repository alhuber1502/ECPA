SONG. FANNY[|BETSY] OF THE HILL. 

1770.

IF gentle Love's immortal fire
 Could animate the quill,
 Soon should the rapture-speaking Lyre
 Sing Betsy of the Hill. 

My panting heart incessant moves,
 No interval 'tis still;
 And all my ravish'd nature loves
 Sweet Betsy of the Hill. 

Her dying soft expressive eye,
 Her elegance must kill,
 Ye Gods! how many thousands die
 For Betsy of the Hill. 

A love-taught tongue angelic air
 A sentiment, a skill
 In all the graces of the Fair,
 Mark Betsy of the Hill. 

Thou mighty Power, eternal Fate,
 My happiness to fill,
 O! bless a wretched Lover's state
 With Betsy of the Hill.
