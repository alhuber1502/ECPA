the three lamp;

or, the hermit of the wood.

obedient to the omnipotent command,
nature confess its mighty former hand;
first smile vegetation gay rise,
then, over the earth, unconscious beauty glow;
and from that heavenly spark that spread his sway,
be kindle animation vital ray.
by fine degree extend still the plan,
to godlike reason, and imperial man,
high endow, the sovereign of the whole,
nor he the swift escape, nor strong control.
over earth he sit on a unquestioned throne,
a tributary here to god alone;
nor be his view alone to earth confine,
to high view be needful aid assign.
mean content or arrogant bold,
then let not man his faith and hope withhold.
let faith and hope imperfect virtue aid,
and finite â€” own what infinite have say.
come dress i fiction for the ear of youth,
some tale that shall impress the sacred truth.

in day remote, and in a distant clime,
the place and date unchronicle by time;
alcestes live, the wonder of his age,
his country love and pride in the sage;
all bounteous heaven enrich his copious store,
with kind affection, and persuasion power,
if earth too strong once have draw his mind,
one early trial earth-born care refine;
sudden he lose, in pride of bloom year,
the lovely partner of his joy and care.
his patient tear be sow with future praise,
and quench the sanguine hope of follow day;
he mark the good and ill as equal give,
a guide through time and death, to life and heaven;
and on a mind so tempere, heaven bestow,
its needful aid to keep his heavenly road;
then who so fit the traveller to convey,
and guide the inexperienced in their way.

philario's son his anxious care divide,
for they be fortune, care, and prayer employ.
love still more fearful, as it more endear,
give he the anxious joy of hope and fear;
he oft their virtue and their fault will try,
and scan they with a parent watchful eye;
as heir of heaven, his son he fond view,
nor his low aim confine to earthly good;
early exalt his unclouded power,
his old son to learning give his hour;
by philosophic virtue firm arm,
by moral beauty be Eugenio charm;
unaided by high hope or coward fear,
all for itself to he be virtue dear;
worthy the scale he hold in nature plan,
approve by reason, and become man.
as toy or bugbear, child please or fright,
reward and punishment be motive light,
hence in philario's breast foreboding fear,
hence self-dependent virtue, draw his tear.

the love and grace smile on philo morn,
and all the charity his soul adorn;
from generous feeling, philo action move,
and all his god be form of peace and love;
he joy to hope reward for virtue give,
but think no stern decree can flow from heaven;
his gentle nature, stranger to offence,
treat the vicious with benevolence;
he say for misery god no being give,
and even the guilty, mercy mean to save;
with joy his father view his virtue mild,
yet will he mourn one error of his child,
that through his action though they sweet shine,
those virtue sit on a unguarded throne.

the fair perfection which his brother own,
with admiration soon Ascanius find;
candid, he less attainment soon can see,
but those he guard by humility;
his knowledge will by patient labour earn,
nor ever deem himself too wise to learn;
the dread of pain and prospect of reward,
his heart accept, as its firm guard.

such be the son who win each tender part,
each anxious feeling of philario's heart,
his happy hour be with their virtue share,
nor tender lesson to their fault he spare;
but habit ever strengthen in their course,
and lesson oft repeat lose their force;
that truth may be with novelty convey,
the careful father seek for foreign aid;
his search meet the sage high renown,
for wisdom and for virtue full know;
to he philario seek his doubt to paint,
and pour his soul in many a fond complaint;
pity he say, and hear i reverend sage,
so heaven support thou in decline age;
thy counsel to my need then straight display,
and aid i, far as human wisdom may;
thy deed be wisdom, and thy trust be god,
then who so fit to mark a dubious road;
three virtuous son i have, my age pride,
to fame on earth, and to heaven hope ally;
oh! may their virtue never their heart forsake,
nor those high hope be lose by sad mistake,
as fare the mariner who near the shore,
trust the false calm and count the danger over,
when sad reverse, he thoughtless meet between,
the sudden tempest, and the rock unseen,
all unprovided with the mean to save,
for home and safety he must meet a grave.
the mean be heaven, alcestes gentle say,
by my success be confidence repay;
to morrow, ever the orb serene of night,
give her chaste beam for Sol depart light;
let i receive thy treasure to my care,
the close day i ever end with prayer;
as to high heaven event be only know,
so sanctify be mortal work begin.

philario leave the sage with thanks express,
and lighten be the care that weigh his breast;
the sage message to his son he break,
and high of his worth and wisdom speak.
the youth with fond attention catch the strain,
and chide the hour that yet their step detain.
eugenio fancy, in alcestes find,
those equal power that charm in kindred mind,
think how the depth of science they will explore,
and to exalt height of knowledge soar;
or how they shall define the unerring plan,
which honour draw for rectitude in man.
fix virtue in her independent sphere,
unaided by reward or abject fear;
with warm impatience philo bosom glow,
to such a friend his feeling to disclose;
revolve the joy that sympathy impart,
when generous feeling bind congenial heart;
and while such sympathy their heart expand,
they shall not, mark mercy spare hand,
deem punishment annex to man offence,
but clasp the scheme of wide benevolence.

Ascanius hope to hear by he define,
heaven mercy with its justice how combine;
those high reward that meet the happy saint,
the joy of heaven, he long to hear he paint;
potent, the strong temptation to defeat,
speak the dire scene the impenitent await;
each think alcestes as himself believe,
and thus the intermediate time deceive.

it be when the virgin yield her brilliant sway,
and tempere season smile in equal day,
philario's son, by youthful ardor bend,
to greet alcestes 'mansion joyful go.
in youth gay season, when few care annoy,
alive to present and to future joy,
imagination aid each scene to warm,
and paint each beauty with a heighten charm;
more gay to they, revive spring be see,
more fresh, the verdure of its tender green;
more rich waft the fragrance of the air,
unclouded dawn the promise of their year,
more sweet, the season crown with Flora rose.
where ripen beauty summer sun disclose;
where splendour, fragrance, and soft harmony,
meet health full sense and fancy vivid eye;
so, to the youth now more majestic shine,
illustrious autumn, on her golden throne,
queen of the year, they see she now display,
the gift which tributary season pay;
the blush orchard, and the wave corn,
beneath her paint sky her reign adorn;
nor lose to they, her colour now expand,
as her rich tint display her change hand.
thus please they leave their parent and their home,
and now most please they see alcestes dome.
midway, down a mountain woody side,
the mansion rise in venerable pride;
mid rock and grove it rise in stately show,
and seem the sovereign of the vale below;
where the gay scene that strike the wonder eye,
seem empire of each rural deity;
her golden banner Ceres there display,
and Flora lovely child paint the mead;
Pomona over the hedgerow spread her blush,
and with rich purple deck the lowly bush;
amid tall fir, and solemn-seeming yew,
the village church, there steal upon the view;
as just emerge from surround shade,
it give a decent order to the glade.
hill rise on hill, to lead the extend eye,
till with its kindred blue, they mix in sky.
its stream collect, gather still new force,
between, a river take its rapid course;
a careful debtor, and a subject free,
hasten its will water to the sea.
from scene like these their soften heart imbibe,
what most have feel, but few can well describe.

alcestes now advance to their view,
who the appoint time to meet they draw;
serene as eve, as autumn rich to bless,
he seem the genius of his native place;
with hasten step, philario's son he meet,
and thus in accent mild their come greet,
welcome young friend, your presence please more,
as thus observant of a old man hour,
for faith and truth philario's son be know,
though youth to folly and neglect be prone,
our course of friendship shall be safe tread,
hope mark the end, when we begin with god;
from dignity serene, and mild benevolence,
these word mix awe with gentle confidence.
he lead they through the wind of the wood,
to where the chapel of the mansion stand,
in decent order all the household there,
attend the blessing of their master prayer,
and there the observance of the world they shun,
thus every day be close, and morn begin;
no warm dispute, or lecture oft as vain,
employ the hour of eve that yet remain,
but through the harmless jest, or story course,
instruction lose its name, but take its force.

philario's son with admiration fraught,
a humble notion of themselves be teach,
their recollect vanity regret,
and view their wisdom as a counterfeit;
their heart, late nature lovely scene expand,
and now they own a master skilful hand;
free from blind opinion to receive,
the important lesson which he wish to give;
dress his purpose in a please view,
which they as entertainment only know;
long as delightless, linger joyless year,
swift fly the inspire moment friendship share;
as high in wisdom and refine in taste,
all seem a wonder that the sage possess;
nor aught escape they as they take their way,
pass along to where their chamber lay.
and now, as still prepare for new delight,
a gallery store with picture strike their sight,
there many a sage and patriot appear,
who bless in life, and be in death revere,
not those who dubious worth high fortune crown,
but who unquestioned merit have renowned;
among the many which they wonder see,
three more than all their fix attention draw,
the painter zeal his magic hand obey,
and almost life and breath his form display,
one narrow path to a bright mansion lead,
along the landscape, over the canvas spread;
three figure pass it with a different fate,
and draw our admiration and regret;
while one with steady eye survey the ground,
keep firm the path, and be with honour crown,
the other leave it, and with wander foot,
though they approach to bliss, destruction meet;
these picture long their curious eye detain,
and much they wish their meaning to explain,
why the same landscape over the three be spread,
and whence the different figure there display;
at early matin they with joy attend,
and anxious wait the come of their friend,
heart open to his counsel they prepare,
and join he in devotion ardent prayer;
the cow bestow they her salubrious treat,
and bread and fruit their wholesome meal complete,
enrapture of the picture now they speak,
and for their meaning to alcestes seek;
oh deign, they say, the mystery to relate,
and why those figure meet such different fate;
then to the gallery straight their host they lead,
and point the piece which they wish to read;
alcestes view they with a wishful eye,
and ere he speak, he heave a feeling sigh;
it be there, he say, enrapture with the theme,
the painter give to sight the poet dream,
for he entwine a never fade wreath,
and almost bid his airy phantom breathe;
nor to the painter give we all the praise,
but now attend to what the legend say;
this say, a scroll of parchment next he show,
and thus proceed its legend to disclose;
