to a lady sit for her picture.

by the same.

the weary look, despond air,
 ill suit, my dear, a face so fair;
 resume your smile; again supply
 the grace catch by fancy eye. 
while Wilson sketch out the piece,
 we will talk, to pass the time, of Greece;
 of Greece, as you have often hear,
 for warrior, and for wit revere;
 the seat of learning, and the grace,
 fame for fine art, but fine face;
 where painter, poet, not as since,
 be great hold than any prince;
 in temple, palace care,
 none more the lady smile possess;
 for they be rich as well as clever,
 and riches be successful ever;
 priest, senate, nation, king desire
 the work their heaven-taught art inspire,
 and if a pencil chance to drop,
 an Alexander pick it up;
 beauty will run to be sketch over;
 the haughty prince, though much a lover,
 once for the copy, payment small,
 resign up the original,
 the fair campaspe matchless charm,
 more conquer than the monarch arm,
 to one Apelles; one who draw
 the queen of love, as Wilson you. 

each lovely maid, of Greece the toast,
 such as our british isle can boast,
 in all their native beauty gay,
 as heb√© young, and sweet as may,
 before he sit: from one he choose
 the eye which love half seem to close;
 this lend a face divine fair,
 a mild, and yet majestic air;
 that give what art in vain will seek,
 the spirit mantl in the cheek,
 and lip that softness seem to speak. 
thus, from their various charm combine,
 one perfect whole impress his mind;
 but have Apelles paint now,
 he may, my dear, have copy you,
 and, as in truth, i think, be do,
 he will have from the picture run,
 and leave the Venus but begin,
 to sacrifice the pride of art
 to the bright goddess of his heart,
 and give up a immortal claim,
 for beauty prize, the prize of fame.
