a ode to fancy.

by the same.

fancy, who delusion vain
sport themselves with human brain;
rival thou of nature power,
can, from thy exhaustless store,
bid a tide of sorrow flow,
and whelm the soul in deep woe:
or in the twinkle of a eye,
raise it to mirth and jollity.
dream and shadow by thou stand,
teach to run at thy command,
and along the wanton air,
flit like empty gossimer.
thou, black melancholy of yore
to the swift-winged Hermes bear:
from the mixture of thy line,
different nature in thou join,
which thou choose to express
by the variance of thy dress.
now like thy sire thou love to seem
light and gay with pinion trim,
dip in all the dye that glow
in the bend of iris bow:
now like thy mother drear and sad,
(all in mournful vestment clad,
cypress weed and sable stole,)
thou rush on the affright soul.
oft i feel thou come on,
when the night have reach her noon,
and darkness, partner of her reign,
round the world have bind her chain,
then with measure step and slow,
in the church-yard path i go,
and while my outward sense sleep,
lose in contemplation deep,
sudden i stop, and turn my ear,
and listen hear, or think i hear.
first a dead and sullen sound
walk along the holy ground;
then through the gloom alternate break
groan, and the shrill screech-owl shriek.
lo! the moon have hide her head,
and the grave give up their dead:
by i pass the ghastly crowd,
wrap in visionary shroud;
maid, who die with love forlorn,
youth, who fall by maidens scorn,
helpless sire and matron old
slay for sordid thirst of gold,
and babe who owe their shorten date
to cruel stepdame ruthless hate;
each their several errand go,
to haunt the wretch that wrought their woe:
from their sight the caitiff fly,
and his heart within he die;
while a horror damp and chill
through his freeze blood do thrill,
and his hair for very dread
bear itself upon his head.
when the early breath of day
have make the shadow flee away;
still possess by thou i rove
bosomed in the shelter grove,
there, with heart and lyre new string,
meditate the lofty song.
and if thou my voice inspire,
and with wonted frenzy fire,
aid by thou i build the rhyme
such, as nor the flight of time,
nor waste flame, nor eat shower,
nor lightning blast can ever devour.
or if chance some moral page
my attentive thought engage,
on i walk, with silent tread,
under the thick-woven shade,
while the thrush, unheeded by,
tune her artless minstrelsy.
listen to their sacred lore,
i think on age long pass over,
when truth and virtue hand in hand
walk upon the smile land.
thence my eye on Britain glance,
and, awaken from my trance,
while my busy thought i rear,
oft i wipe the fall tear.
when the night again descend
and her shadowy cone extend,
over the field i walk alone,
by the silence of the moon.
hark! upon my left i hear
wild music wander in the air;
lead by the sound i onward creep,
and through the neighbour hedge i peep;
there i spy the fairy band
dance on the level land,
now with step alternate bind,
join in one continue round,
now their plight hand unbind,
and such tangle maze wind
as the quick eye can scarce pursue,
and will have puzzle that fame clue,
which lead the athenian unskilled foot
through the labyrinth of Crete.
at the near approach of day,
sudden the music die away,
waste in the sea of air,
and the phantom disappear,
all (as the glowworm wax dim)
vanish like a morning dream,
and of their revel leave no trace,
save the ring upon the grass.
when the elphin show be flee,
home i haste i to my bed;
there if thou with magic wand
on my temple take thy stand,
i see in mix disorder rise
all that strike my wake eye:
so when i stand, and round i gaze,
where the fame lodona stray;
on the wood and thicket brown,
that its sedgy margin crown,
and watch the vagrant cloud that fly
through the vast desert of the sky,
when down i cast my look
on the smooth unruffled brook,
(while its current clear do run,
and hold its mirror to the sun,)
there i see the invert scene
fall, and meet the eye again.
