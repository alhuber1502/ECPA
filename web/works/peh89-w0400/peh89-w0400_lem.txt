absence.

when collin tuneful pipe with soften strain,
 fill with melodious sound the neighbour plain;
 the nightingale responsive, in the grove
 sing her sweet lay, and tune my heart to love:
 but absent now from all that be to i dear,
 a charm in music i no long hear. 

where be the joy the early season bring? 
for herd the grass, for bee the flower spring;
 the blackbird sing on every bloom thorn,
 and freshen daisy every vale adorn:
 in vain the spring for i adorn the plain,
 while in my heart so cold a winter reign. 

the herd in summer seek the cool stream,
 where shady tree exclude the sultry beam;
 the shepherd to some open glade repair,
 where gentle breeze temperate the air:
 but no cool breeze can fan my flame away,
 nor cool stream the latent fire allay. 

rich autumn now add profit to delight,
 and ripen apple every hand invite;
 each swain divide his apple with his fair,
 so i with Collin once be wont to share:
 but now no fruit to please my taste have power,
 not gather by his hand, all fruit be four. 

winter awhile each grow herb restrain,
 and lock all nature in his icy chain;
 his reign but for a season do endure,
 spring smile, and nature feel the powerful cure:
 but ah! my heart be in fast fetter bind,
 which still grow strong as the year go round.
