to his excellency the lord Carteret. occasion by see a poem, entitle, the birth of manly virtue.

the picture strike â€” it be draw with wondrous art;
 well have the poet play the painter part. 
though it be your glory, yet, my lord, i own,
 i grieve the feature fit yourself alone. 
but know, though all agree the picture you,
 it be steadiness alone your claim secure. 
with pleasure now your image you furvey;
 but shall you from the rule of virtue stray,
 shall ever degrade vice deform your frame,
 you will start, like io from the crystal stream. 

when Kneller have display, with matchless grace,
 the fleet glory of clarinda face;
 she sigh, to think how time will soon devour
 the lovely bloom, which give she now such power:
 but you, a likeness of a noble kind,
 display the deathless beauty of the mind:
 be it your glory to surpass the paint,
 and make the finish picture look too faint. 

why be he hide, who, with such matchloss art,
 call forth the grace that adorn your heart? 
true poet in their deathless lay shall live,
 and share that immortality they give.
