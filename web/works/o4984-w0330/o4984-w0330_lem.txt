write at midnight in a thunder storm.

by the same.

let coward guilt with pallid fear,
 to shelter cavern fly,
 and just dread the vengeful fate
 that thunder through the sky;

protect by that hand, who law
 the threaten storm obey,
 intrepid virtue smile secure,
 as in the blaze of day. 

in the thick cloud tremendous gloom,
 the lightning lurid glare,
 it view the same all-gracious power
 that breathe the vernal air. 

through nature ever-varying scene,
 by different way pursue,
 the one eternal end of heaven
 be universal good. 

with like beneficent effect
 over flame Aether glow,
 as when it tune the linnet voice,
 or blush in the rose. 

by reason teach to scorn those fear,
 that vulgar mind molest;
 let no fantastic terror break
 my dear narcissa rest. 

thy life may all the tender care
 of providence defend;
 and delegate angel round
 their guardian wing extend. 

when, through creation vast expanse,
 the last dread thunder roll,
 untune the concord of the sphere,
 and shake the rise soul;

unmoved may thou the final storm
 of jar world survey,
 that usher in the glad serene
 of everlasting day.
