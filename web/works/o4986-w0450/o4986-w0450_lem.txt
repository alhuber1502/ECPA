the invitation.

by the same.

awake, my fair, the morning spring,
 the dew-drop glance around,
 the heifer swallow, the blackbird sing,
 the echo vale resound. 

the simple sweet will Stella taste,
 that breathe morning yield,
 the fragrance of the flowery waste,
 and freshness of the field. 

by upland, and the greenwood-side,
 we will take our early way,
 and view the valley spread wide,
 and open with the day. 

nor uninstructive shall the scene
 unfold its charm in vain,
 the fallow brown, the meadow green,
 the mountain and the plain. 

each dew-drop glisten on the thorn,
 and tremble to its fall,
 each blush that paint the cheek of morn,
 in fancy ear shall call,

 "o you in youth and beauty pride,
" who light dance along;
 "while laughter frolick at your side,
" and rapture tune your song;

 "what though each grace around you play,
" each beauty bloom for you,
 "warm as the blush of rise day,
" and sparkle as the dew:

 "the blush that glow so gay now,
" but glow to disappear;
 "and quiver from the bend bough,
" soon break the pearly tear! 

 "so pass the beauty of your prime,
" that even in bloom die;
 "so, shrink at the blast of time,
" the treacherous grace fly. " 

let those, my Stella, slight the strain,
 who fear to find it true! 
each fair of transient beauty vain,
 and youth as transient too! 

with charm that win beyond the sight,
 and hold the will heart,
 my Stella shall await their flight,
 nor sigh when they depart. 

still grace shall remain behind,
 and beauty still control,
 the grace of the polish mind,
 and beauty of the soul.
