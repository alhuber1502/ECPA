LINES

WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF THE BARONESS D' H——, TO HER TWO DAUGHTERS.

BRIGHT nymphs, of NEWA'S banks the pride,
 Receive, before we part,
 For you, and your maternal guide,
 The wishes of my heart! 

Be every future good your lot! —
 But what can fate do more? 
Has nature any boon forgot
 For you in all her store? 

While, mids't the wreathes the arts have twin'd
 Around your brows, we trace
 That tender modesty of mind
 That decorates the face;

Grac'd with such forms as RAPHAEL drew
 Beneath his happiest star,
 What is there left to ask for you,
 But wish you — what you are?
