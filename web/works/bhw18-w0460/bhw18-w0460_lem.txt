to the baron de Humboldt,

on his bring i some flower in march.

soothe i receive the flower you bring,
 who charm anticipate the spring;
 who tint in vernal freshness vie
 with plant beneath a austral sky, —
 those glow plant that, long unknown,
 your travel science make our own: —
 bright gift! in lavish grace array,
 thy flower have only bloom to fade, —
 their transient be soon forget:
 how far unlike the giver lot!
