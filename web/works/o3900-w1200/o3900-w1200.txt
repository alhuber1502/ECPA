ACTS ii. 41, &c.

I.

THE Word pronounc'd, the Gospel-Word,
 The Crowd with various Hearts receiv'd:
 In many a Soul the Saviour stir'd,
 Three thousand yielded, and believ'd. 

II.

These by th' Apostles' Counsels led,
 With them in mighty Pray'rs combin'd,
 Broke the commemorative Bread,
 Nor from the Fellowship declin'd. 

III.

GOD from above, with ready Grace
 And Deeds of Wonder, guards his Flock,
 Trembles the World before their Face,
 By JESUS crush'd, their Conqu'ring Rock. 

IV.

The happy Band whom CHRIST redeems,
 One only Will, one Judgment know:
 None this contentious Earth esteems,
 Distinctions, or Delights below. 

V.

The Men of worldly Wealth possest
 Their Selfish Happiness remove,
 Sell, and divide it to the rest,
 And buy the Blessedness of Love. 

VI.

Thus in the Presence of their GOD,
 JESUS their Life, and Heav'n their Care,
 With single Heart they took their Food
 Heighten'd by Eucharist and Pray'r. 

VII.

GOD in their ev'ry Work was prais'd:
 The People bless'd the Law benign:
 Daily the Church, his Arm had rais'd,
 Receiv'd the Sons of Mercy in.
