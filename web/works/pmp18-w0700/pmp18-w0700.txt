On the Same Person.

While faster than his costive Brain indites,
 Philo's quick Hand in flowing Letters writes;
 His Case appears to Me like honest Teague's,
 When he was run away with, by his Legs. 
Phoebus, give Philo o'er Himself Command;
 Quicken his Senses, or restrain His Hand. 
Let Him be kept from Paper, Pen, and Ink:
 So may He cease to Write, and learn to Think.
