to m.  i  

light breeze dance along the air,
 the sky in smile be dress,
 and heaven pure vault, serene and fair,
 portray the cheerful breast. 

each object on this move ball
 assume a lovely hue;
 so fair good-humour brighten all
 that come within her view. 

her presence glad the youthful train,
 reanimate the gay,
 and, round she, by the couch of pain,
 the light-winged grace play. 

her win mien and prompt reply,
 can sullen pride appease;
 and the sweet arch of her eye
 even apathy must please. 

to you, with who the damsel dwell
 a voluntary guest,
 to you, Maria, memory tell,
 this tribute be address. 

the feeble strain that i bequeathe,
 with melody overpay;
 and let thy love piano breathe
 a sweet responsive lay. 

although the mellow sound will rise,
 so distant from my ear,
 the charmer fancy, when she try,
 can make they present here. 

can paint thou, as with rapture bend,
 you hail the power of song;
 when the light finger quick descend,
 and fly the note along:

feel the soft chord of sadness meet,
 a echo in the soul,
 and wake joy the strain repeat,
 when mirth quick measure roll,

this "mistress of the powerful spell,"
 can every joy impart;
 and ah! you doubtless know too well
 how she can wring the heart. 

she rule i with despotic reign,
 as now i say adieu;
 and make i feel a sort of pain,
 as if i speak to you.
