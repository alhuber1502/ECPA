An EPITAPH.

A Heart to Mercy as to Zeal inclin'd,
 As well a gentle as a prudent Mind;
 Still free to pardon, cautious to offend
 A tender Parent and a faithful Friend. 
All Parts perform'd, she willingly withdrew,
 Turn'd from the World, and bid her Friends adieu. 
Ah thou! (if Spirits or regard or know
 The Sigh of Friendship or a Daughter's Woe)
 Mix'd with those Tears that wash the sacred Shrine,
 Accept the Tribute of a grateful Line.
