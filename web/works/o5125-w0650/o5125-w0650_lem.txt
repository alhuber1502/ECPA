a epitaph.

a heart to mercy as to zeal incline,
 as well a gentle as a prudent mind;
 still free to pardon, cautious to offend
 a tender parent and a faithful friend. 
all part perform, she will withdraw,
 turn from the world, and bid her friend adieu. 
ah thou! (if spirit or regard or know
 the sigh of friendship or a daughter woe)
 mix with those tear that wash the sacred shrine,
 accept the tribute of a grateful line.
