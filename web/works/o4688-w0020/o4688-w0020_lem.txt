[fragment] ii.

i sit by the mossy fountain; on the top of the hill of wind. one tree be rustle above i. dark wave roll over the heath. the lake be trouble below. the deer descend from the hill. no hunter at a distance be see; no whistle cowherd be nigh. it be midday: but all be silent. sad be my thought as i sit alone. do thou but appear, o my love, a wanderer on the heath! thy hair float on the wind behind thou; thy bosom heave on the sight; thy eye full of tear for thy friend, who the mist of the hill have conceal! thou i will comfort, my love, and bring thou to thy father house.

but be it she that there appear, like a beam of light on the heath? bright as the moon in autumn, as the sun in a summer-storm? — she speak: but how weak her voice! like the breeze in the reed of the pool. hark! 

return thou safe from the war? where be thy friend, my love? i hear of thy death on the hill; i hear and mourn thou, shilric!

yes, my fair, i return; but i alone of my race. thou shall see they no more: their grave i raise on the plain. but why be thou on the desert hill? why on the heath, alone?

alone i be, o shilric! alone in the winter-house. with grief for thou i expire. shilric, i be pale in the tomb.

she fleet, she sail away; as grey mist before the wind! — and, will thou not stay, my love? stay and behold my tear? fair thou appear, my love! fair thou be, when alive!

by the mossy fountain i will sit; on the top of the hill of wind. when midday be silent around, converse, o my love, with i! come on the wing of the gale! on the blast of the mountain, come! let i hear thy voice, as thou pass, when midday be silent around.
