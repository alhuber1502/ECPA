song.

by the same.

as Chloe ply her needle art,
a purple drop the spear
make from her heedless finger start,
and from her eye a tear.

ah! may but Chloe by her smart
be teach for i to feel;
my cause by Cupid pierce dart,
more sharp than point steel!

then i her needle will adore,
love arrow it shall be,
endue with such a subtle power
to reach her heart for i.
