song.

both gloomy and dark be the shadowy night,
 the leaden-surged ocean heave slow each wave,
 silence solemn as death succeed the light,
 and each ravenous prowler steal forth from its cave. 

now to a sea-beach, where a black baleful yew
 over venomous weed its dark shadow impress,
 disorder by grief the wild Tamara fly,
 as the wind be her brain, as the ocean her breast. 

then frequent and loud be her cry over the main,
 with passion she heave, with distraction be tear;
 the dead shore long-murm'ring re-echo in vain,
 nor will peace ever again to her bosom return. 

she mourn for the dead, the cold senseless dead,
 her love, who beneath the salt billow do lie,
 and the deep grave she seek, where rest his fair head,
 loose-flying her tress, distract her eye. 

the night as it darken increase her pain,
 her mind teem with horror, which deepen the gloom;
 she hear his love voice, shrill it call she again,
 and his cold breast she seek in the billowy tomb. 

distract and lose, her poor shatter heart
 with passion be urge, which no force can control,
 deep-plunging, in death she subdue her fierce smart,
 and from its tear mansion thus free her young soul.
