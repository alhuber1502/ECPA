ON A SCOTCH BARD GONE TO THE WEST INDIES.

A' Ye wha live by sowps o' drink,
 A' ye wha live by crambo-clink,
 A' ye wha live and never think,
 Come, mourn wi' me! 
Our billie's gien us a' a jink,
 An' owre the Sea. 

Lament him a' ye rantan core,
 Wha dearly like a random-splore;
 Nae mair he'll join the merry roar,
 In social key;
 For now he's taen anither snore,
 An' owre the Sea! 

The bonie lasses weel may wiss him,
 And in their dear petitions place him:
 The widows, wives, an' a' may bless him,
 Wi' tearfu' e'e;
 For weel I wat they'll sairly miss him
 That's owre the Sea! 

O Fortune, they hae room to grumble! 
Hadst thou taen aff some drowsy bummle,
 Wha can do nought but fyke an' fumble,
 'Twad been nae plea;
 But he was gleg as onie wumble,
 That's owre the Sea! 

Auld, cantie KYLE may weepers wear,
 An' stain them wi' the saut, saut tear:
 'Twill mak her poor, auld heart, I fear,
 In flinders flee:
 He was her Laureat monie a year,
 That's owre the Sea! 

He saw Misfortune's cauld Nor-west
 Lang-mustering up a bitter blast;
 A Jillet brak his heart at last,
 Ill may she be! 
So, took a birth afore the mast,
 An' owre the Sea. 

To tremble under Fortune's cummock,
 On scarce a bellyfu' o' drummock,
 Wi' his proud, independant stomach,
 Could ill agree;
 So, row't his hurdies in a hammock,
 An' owre the Sea. 

He ne'er was gien to great misguidin,
 Yet coin his pouches wad na bide in;
 Wi' him 'it ne'er was under hidin;
 He dealt it free:
 The Muse was a' that he took pride in,
 That's owre the Sea. 

Jamaica bodies, use him weel,
 An' hap him in a cozie biel:
 Ye'll find him ay a dainty chiel,
 An' fou o' glee:
 He wad na wrang'd the vera Diel,
 That's owre the Sea. 

Fareweel, my rhyme-composing billie! 
Your native soil was right ill-willie;
 But may ye flourish like a lily,
 Now bonilie! 
I'll toast you in my hindmost gillie,
 Tho' owre the Sea!
