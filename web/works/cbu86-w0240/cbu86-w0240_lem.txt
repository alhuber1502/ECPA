on a scotch bard go to the west Indies.

of you who live by sowp of drink,
 of you who live by crambo-clink,
 of you who live and never think,
 come, mourn with i! 
our billy gien we all a jink,
 and our the sea. 

lament he all you rantan core,
 who dear like a random-splore;
 no more he will join the merry roar,
 in social key;
 for now he be take anoth snore,
 and our the sea! 

the bony lass well may wiss he,
 and in their dear petition place he:
 the widow, wife, and all may bless he,
 with tearful e'e;
 for well i that they will fair miss he
 that be our the sea! 

o fortune, they have room to grumble! 
have thou take off some drowsy bummle,
 who can do nought but fyke and fumble,
 'twad be no plea;
 but he be gleg as any wumble,
 that be our the sea! 

old, canty Kyle may weeper wear,
 and stain they with the saut, saut tear:
 it will make her poor, old heart, i fear,
 in flinder flee:
 he be her laureate money a year,
 that be our the sea! 

he see misfortune cauld nor-west
 long-mustering up a bitter blast;
 a jillet brak his heart at last,
 ill may she be! 
so, take a birth afore the mast,
 and our the sea. 

to tremble under Fortune cummock,
 on scarce a bellyful of drummock,
 with his proud, independent stomach,
 can ill agree;
 so, row his hurdy in a hammock,
 and our the sea. 

he never be gien to great misguidin,
 yet coin his pouch will have na bide in;
 with he 'it never be under hidin;
 he deal it free:
 the muse be all that he take pride in,
 that be our the sea. 

Jamaica body, use he well,
 and hap he in a cosy biel:
 you will find he ay a dainty chiel,
 and fou of glee:
 he will have na wronge the vera diel,
 that be our the sea. 

farewell, my rhyme-composing billy! 
your native soil be right ill-willie;
 but may you flourish like a lily,
 now bonilie! 
i will toast you in my hindmost gillie,
 though our the sea!
