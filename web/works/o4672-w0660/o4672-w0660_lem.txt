to John Hartopp ESQ

the disdain of sensual joy.

Hartopp, i love the soul that dare
 tread the temptation of his year
 beneath his youthful foot:
 Fleetwood and all thy heavenly line
 look through the star, and smile divine
 upon a heir so great. 
young Hartopp know this noble theme,
 that the wild scene of Busie life,
 the noise, the amusement, and the strife
 be but the vision of the night,
 gay phantom of delusive light,
 or a vexatious dream. 

ii.

flesh be the vile and the least
 ingredient of our frame,
 we be bear to live above the beast,
 or quit the manly name:
 pleasure of sense we leave for boy,
 be shine dust the miser food,
 let fancy feed on fame and noise;
 soul must pursue divine joy,
 and seize the immortal good.
