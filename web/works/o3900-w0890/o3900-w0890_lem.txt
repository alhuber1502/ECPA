psalm xlvi. 

i 

on god supreme our hope depend,
 who omnipresent sight
 even to the pathless realm extend
 of uncreated night. 

ii.

plunge in the abyss of deep distress,
 to he we raise our cry:
 he mercy bad our sorrow cease,
 and fill our tongue with joy. 

iii.

though earth her ancient seat forsake
 by pang convulsive tear,
 though her self-balanced fabric shake,
 and ruin nature mourn:

iv.

though hill be in the ocean lose
 with all their tremble load,
 no fear shall ever disturb the just,
 or shake his trust in god. 

v. 

nation remote and realm unknown
 in vain resist his sway;
 for lo! jehovah voice be show,
 and earth shall melt away. 

vi.

let war devour surge rise
 and swell on every side:
 the lord of host our safeguard be,
 and Jacob god our guide.
