day:

a pastoral.

by mr. Cunningham.

morning.

i 

in the barn the tenant cock,
 close to partlet perch on high,
 brisk crow, (the shepherd clock!) 
jocund that the morning nigh. 

ii.

swift from the mountain brow,
 shadow, nurse by night, retire:
 and the peep sun-beam, now,
 paint with gold the village spire. 

iii.

philomel forsake the thorn,
 plaintive where she prate at night;
 and the lark, to meet the morn,
 so ars beyond the shepherd sight. 

iv.

from the low-roofed cottage ridge,
 see the chatter swallow spring;
 dart through the one-arched bridge,
 quick she dip her dapple wing. 

v. 

now the pine-tree wave top,
 gentle greet the morning gale:
 kidling, now, begin to crop
 daisy, on the dewy dale. 

vi.

from the balmy sweet, uncloyed,
 (restless till her task be do)
 now the busy bee employ
 sip dew before the sun. 

vii.

trickle through the creviced rock,
 where the limpid stream distil,
 sweet refreshment wait the flock
 when it be sun-drove from the hill. 

viii.

colin for the promise corn
 (ere the harvest hope be ripe)
 anxious; — while the huntsman horn,
 bold sound, drown his pipe. 

ix.

sweet, — o sweet, warble throng,
 on the white emblossom spray! 
nature universal song
 echos to the rise day. 

noon.

x. 

fervid on the glitter flood,
 now the noontide radiance glow:
 droop over its infant bud,
 not a dew-drop's leave the rose. 

xi.

by the brook the shepherd dine,
 from the fierce meridian heat
 shelter by the branch pine,
 pendant over his grassy seat. 

xii.

now the flock forsake the glade,
 where unchecked the sunbeam fall;
 sure to find a please shade
 by the ivy abbey wall. 

xiii.

echo in her airy round,
 over the river, rock, and hill
 can catch a single sound,
 save the clack of yonder mill. 

xiv.

cattle court the zephyr bland,
 where the streamlet wander cool;
 or with languid silence stand
 midway in the marshy pool. 

XV. 

but from mountain, dell, or stream,
 not a flutter zephyr spring:
 fearful lest the noontide beam
 scorch its soft, its silken wing. 

xvi.

not a leaf have leave to stir,
 nature lull — serene — and still! 
quiet even the shepherd cur,
 sleep on the heath-clad hill. 

xvii.

languid be the landscape round,
 till the fresh descend shower,
 grateful to the thirsty ground,
 raise every faint flower. 

xviii.

now the hill — the hedge — be green,
 now the warblers throat in tune;
 blithsome be the verdant scene,
 brighten by the beam of noon! 

evening.

xix.

over the heath the heifer stray
 free; — (the furrow task be do)
 now the village window blaze,
 burnish by the set sun. 

xx.

now he set behind the hill,
 sink from a golden sky:
 can the pencil mimic skill
 copy the refulgent dye? 

xxi.

trudge as the ploughman go,
 (to the smoke hamlet bind)
 giantlike their shadow grow,
 lengthen over the level ground. 

xxii.

where the rise forest spread
 shelter, for the lordly dome! 
to their high build airy bed,
 see the rook return home;

xxiii.

as the lark with vary tune,
 carol to the evening loud;
 mark the mild resplendent moon,
 break through a part cloud! 

xxiv.

now the hermit howlet peep
 from the barn, or twist brake;
 and the blue mist slow creep,
 curl on the silver lake. 

xxv.

as the trout in speckle pride,
 playful from its bosom spring;
 to the bank, a ruffle tide
 verges im successive ring. 

xxvi.

trip through the silken grass,
 over the path-divided dale,
 mark the rose-complexioned lass
 with her well-poised milken pail. 

xxvii.

linnet with unnumbered note,
 and the cuckoo bird with two,
 tune sweet their mellow throat,
 bid the set sun adieu.
