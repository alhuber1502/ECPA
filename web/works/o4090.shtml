And I appeal to any Reader, if this is not the Condition in which these Titular Odes appear.</p><p id="o4090-s00050">On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the Odes of <span class="hi">Pindar,</span> both as to the exact Observation of the Measures and Numbers of his Stanza's and Verses, and the perpetual Coherence of his Thoughts. For tho' his Digressions are frequent, and his Transitions sudden, yet is there ever some secret Connexion, which tho' not always appearing to the Eye, never fails to communicate it self to the Understanding of the Reader.</p><p id="o4090-s00055">The Liberty which he took in his Numbers, and which has been so misunderstood and misapply'd by his pretended Imitators, was only in varying the Stanza's in different Odes; but in each particular Ode they are ever Correspondent one to another in their Turns, and according to the Order of the Ode.</p><p id="o4090-s00060">All the Odes of <span class="hi">Pindar</span> are Songs of Triumph, Victory or Success in the <span class="hi">Grecian</span> Games: They were sung by a Chorus, and adapted to the <span class="hi">Lyre,</span> and sometimes<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d42561e1548">[Page]</span> to the <span class="hi">Lyre</span> and<span id="o4090-n00040_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Pind.

See <span class="hi">Eras. Schmid. Prolegom. in Olymp. &amp; de Carmin.

Some have thought that by the Contrariety of the <span class="hi">Strophé</span> and <span class="hi">Antistrophé,</span> they intended to represent the Contrarotation of the <span class="hi">Primum Mobile,</span> in respect of the <span class="hi">Secunda Mobilia;</span> and that by their standing still at the <span class="hi">Epode,</span> they meant to signifie the Stability of the Earth. <span id="o4090-n00050_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Pind.

The Poet having made choice of a certain Number of Verses to constitute his <span class="hi">Strophé</span> or first <span class="hi">Stanza,</span> was oblig'd to observe the same in his <span class="hi">Antistrophé,</span> or second <span class="hi">Stanza;</span> and which accordingly perpetually agreed whenever repeated, both in number of Verses and quantity of Feet: He was then again at liberty, to make a new choice for his third <span class="hi">Stanza,</span> or <span class="hi">Epode;</span> where, accordingly, he diversify'd his Numbers as his Ear or Fancy led him; composing that <span class="hi">Stanza</span> of more or fewer Verses than the former, and those Verses of different Measures and Quantities, for the greater Variety of Harmony, and Entertainment of the Ear.</p><p id="o4090-s00075">But then this <span class="hi">Epode</span> being thus form'd, he was strictly oblig'd to the same<span id="o4090-n00055_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Vid.

That I have mention'd 'em here, and observ'd the Order of 'em in the ensuing Ode, is therefore only the more intelligibly to explain the extraordinary Regularity of the Composition of those Odes, which have been represented to us hitherto, as the most confus'd Structures in Nature.</p><p id="o4090-s00100">However, tho' there be no necessity that our Triumphal Odes should consist of the Three afore-mention'd Stanza's; yet if the Reader can observe that the great Variation of the Numbers in the Third Stanza (call it <span class="hi">Epode,</span> or what you please) has a pleasing Effect in the Ode, and makes him return to the First and Second Stanza's, with more Appetite, than he could do if always cloy'd with the same Quantities and Measures, I cannot see why some Use may not be made of <span class="hi">Pindar's</span> Example, to the great Improvement of the <span class="hi">English</span> Ode. There is certainly a Pleasure in beholding any Thing that has Art and Difficulty in the Contrivance; especially, if it appears so carefully executed, that the Difficulty does not shew it self, 'till it is sought for; and that the seeming Easiness of the Work, first sets us upon the Enquiry. Nothing can be call'd Beautiful without Proportion. When Symmetry and Harmony are wanting, neither the Eye nor the Ear can be pleas'd. Therefore certainly <span class="hi">Poetry,</span> which includes Painting and Musick, should not be destitute of 'em; and of all <span class="hi">Poetry,</span> especially the <span class="hi">Ode,</span> whose End and Essence is Harmony.</p><p id="o4090-s00105">Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley,</span> in his Preface to his Pindarique Odes, speaking of the Musick of Numbers, says, <span class="hi">which sometimes (especially in Songs and Odes) almost without any thing else makes an Excellent Poet. </span></p><p id="o4090-s00110">Having mention'd Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley,</span> it may very well be expected, that something should be said of him, at a time when the Imitation of <span class="hi">Pindar</span> is the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d42561e5618">[Page]</span> Theme of our Discourse. But there is that great Deference due to the Memory, great Parts, and Learning of that Gentleman, that I think nothing should be objected to the Latitude he has taken in his Pindarique Odes. The Beauty of his Verses, are an Attonement for the Irregularity of his Stanza's; and tho' he did not imitate <span class="hi">Pindar</span> in the Strictness of his Numbers, he has very often happily copy'd him in the Force of his Figures, and Sublimity of his Stile and Sentiments.</p><p id="o4090-s00115">Yet I must beg leave to add, that I believe those irregular Odes of Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley,</span> may have been the principal, tho' innocent Occasion of so many deformed Poems since, which instead of being true Pictures of <span class="hi">Pindar,</span> have (to use the <span class="hi">Italian</span> Painters Term) been only <span class="hi">Caricatura's</span> of him, Resemblances that for the most part have been either Horrid or Ridiculous.</p><p id="o4090-s00120">For my own part I frankly own my Error, in having heretofore mis-call'd a few irregular <span class="hi">Stanza's</span> a Pindarique Ode; and possibly, if others, who have been under the same Mistake, would ingenuously confess the Truth, they might own, that never having consulted <span class="hi">Pindar</span> himself, they took all his Irregularity upon trust; and finding their Account in the great Ease with which they could produce Odes, without being oblig'd either to Measure or Design, remain'd satisfy'd; and it may be were not altogether unwilling to neglect being undeceiv'd.</p><p id="o4090-s00125">Tho' there be little (if any thing) left of <span class="hi">Orpheus</span> but his Name, yet if<span id="o4090-n00075_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Boeotic. pag. 588." href="#o4090-n00075" aria-controls="o4090-n00075" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o4090-n00075"><sup>*</sup> <span class="hi">Boeotic. pag.</span> 588.</span> <span class="hi">Pausanias</span> was well inform'd, we may be assur'd that <span class="hi">Brevity</span> was a Beauty which he most industriously labour'd to preserve in his <span class="hi">Hymns,</span> notwithstanding, as the same Author reports, that they were but few in Number.</p><p id="o4090-s00130">The Shortness of the following Ode will, I hope, attone for the Length of the Preface, and in some measure for the Defects which may be found in it.
