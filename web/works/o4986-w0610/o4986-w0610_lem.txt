autumn:

a ode,

by the same.

alas! with swift and silent pace
 impatient time roll on the year,
 the season change, and nature face
 now sweet smile, now frown severe. 

it be spring, it be summer, all be gay,
 now autumn bend a cloudy brow,
 the flower of spring be sweep away,
 and summer fruit desert the bough. 

the verdant leaf that play on high,
 and wanton on the western breeze,
 now tread in dust, neglect lie,
 as Boreas strip the bend tree. 

the field that wave with golden grain,
 as russet heath be wild and bare;
 not moist with dew, but drench in rain;
 nor health, nor pleasure, wander there. 

no more, while through the midnight shade,
 beneath the moon pale orb i stray,
 soft please woe my heart invade,
 as progne pour the melt lay. 

from this capricious clime she soar,
 o! will some god but wing supply! 
to where each morn the spring restore,
 companion of her flight i will fly. 

vain wish! i fate compel to bear
 the downward season iron reign,
 compel to breathe pollute air,
 and shiver on a blast plain. 

what bliss to life can autumn yield,
 if gloom, and shower, and storm prevail,
 and Ceres fly the naked field,
 and flower, and fruit, and Phoebus fail? 

oh! what remain, what linger yet
 to cheer i in the darken hour? 
the grape remain! the friend of wit,
 in love and mirth of mighty power. 

haste, press the cluster, fill the bowl â€”
 Apollo! shoot thy part ray;
 this give the sunshine of the soul,
 this, god of health, and verse, and day. 

still, still, the jocund strain shall flow,
 the pulse with vigorous rapture beat;
 my Stella with new charm shall glow,
 and every bliss in wine shall meet.
