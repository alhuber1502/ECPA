the empty purse

what all despise, and all agree to curse,
 i view with pride and joy, a empty purse. 
when it be full, so be my heart of woe,
 i know not what to do, nor where to go. 
i will be generous, but i long for dress;
 appear great, i make myself look less. 
i that no kindred ever dare to claim;
 find fifty kind relation of my name. 
no more can i complain of friend neglect,
 and dare falsehood hang around my neck;
 amaze i cry, what mean this mighty change;
 the forward fool reply, it be nothing strange. 
wretch, take my gold, i say, my great curse,
 leave i a honest heart, and empty purse.
