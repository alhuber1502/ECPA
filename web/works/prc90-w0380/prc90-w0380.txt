THE EMPTY PURSE

What all despise, and all agree to curse,
 I view with pride and joy, an Empty Purse. 
When it was full, so was my heart of woe,
 I knew not what to do, nor where to go. 
I would be gen'rous, but I long'd for dress;
 Appearing great, I made myself look less. 
I that no kindred ever dar'd to claim;
 Found fifty kind relations of my name. 
No more could I complain of friends neglect,
 And daring falsehood hung around my neck;
 Amaz'd I cried, What means this mighty change;
 The forward fool replied, 'Tis nothing strange. 
Wretch, take my gold, I said, my greatest curse,
 Leave me an honest heart, and empty purse.
