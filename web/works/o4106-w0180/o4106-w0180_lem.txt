a hymn to contentment.

lovely, last peace of mind! 
sweet delight of human kind! 
heavenly bear, and breed on high,
 to crown the favourite of the sky
 with more of happiness below,
 than victor in a triumph know! 
whither, o whither be thou flee,
 to lay thy meek, content head? 
what happy region do thou please
 to make the seat of calm and ease? 

ambition search all its sphere
 of pomp and state, to meet thou there. 
increase avarice will find
 thy presence in its gold enshrine. 
the bold adventurer plough his way,
 through rock amid the foam sea,
 to gain thy love; and then perceive
 thou be not in the rock and wave. 
the silent heart which grief assail,
 tread soft and lonesome over the vale,
 see daisy open, river run,
 and seek (as i have vain do)
 amuse thought; but learn to know
 that solitude the nurse of woe. 
no real happiness be find
 in trail purple over the ground:
 or in a soul exalt high,
 to range the circuit of the sky,
 converse with star above, and know
 all nature in its form below;
 the rest it seek, in seek die,
 and doubt at last for knowledge rise. 

lovely, last peace appear! 
this world it self, if thou be here,
 be once again with Eden bless,
 and man contain it in his breast. 

it be thus, as under shade i stand,
 i sing my wish to the wood,
 and lose in thought, no more perceive
 the branch whisper as they wave:
 it seem, as all the quiet place
 confess the presence of the grace. 
when thus she speak — go rule thy will,
 bid thy wild passion all be still,
 know god — and bring thy heart to know,
 the joy which from religion flow:
 then every grace shall prove its guest,
 and i will be there to crown the rest. 

oh! by yonder mossy seat,
 in my hour of sweet retreat;
 may i thus my soul employ,
 with sense of gratitude and joy:
 raise as ancient prophet be,
 in heavenly vision, praise, and prayer;
 please all man, hurt none,
 please and bless with god alone:
 then while the garden take my sight,
 with all the colour of delight;
 while silver Waters glide along,
 to please my ear, and court my song:
 i will lift my voice, and tune my string,
 and thou, great source of nature, sing. 

the sun that walk his airy way,
 to light the world, and give the day;
 the moon that shine with borrow light;
 the star that gild the gloomy night;
 the sea that roll unnumbered wave;
 the wood that spread its shady leaf;
 the field who ear conceal the grain,
 the yellow treasure of the plain;
 all of these, and all i see,
 shall be sing, and sing by i:
 they speak their maker as they can,
 but want and ask the tongue of man. 

go search among your idle dream,
 your busy, or your vain extreme;
 and find a life of equal bliss,
 or own the next begin in this.
