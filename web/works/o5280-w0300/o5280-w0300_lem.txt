the immortality of virtue.

to mrs. frinsham.

from these number as they flow,
 shepherd-maid this moral know;
 soon shall beauty bright bloom
 moulder in the cheerless tomb;
 charm that light the blaze of love,
 soon the force of time shall prove;
 vain beam the glisten eye,
 quench in dust each star shall lie;
 yet when death destructive dart
 chill to rest the beat heart,
 virtue flame unquenched shall burn,
 cheer the grave, and gild the urn.
