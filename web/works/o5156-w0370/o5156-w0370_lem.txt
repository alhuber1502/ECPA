transcribe from the reverend mr. pixel parsonage garden near Birmingham, 1757. 

seek not in these path to view
dryad green, or naiad blue;
such as haunt, at eve or dawn,
 enville lake, or hagley lawn:
such as sport on worfield mead;
such as shenstone genius lead
over vale and hill, and to their care
consign his wave and woodland fair;
while the muse vacant stray,
and echo want her sweet lay.

long, long may those unrivalled shine,
nor shall my temperate breast repine,
so music lend her will aid
to gladden this ignoble shade;
so peace endear this humble plain â€”
and haply elegance will deign
to wander here, and smile see
her sister nymph simplicity.
