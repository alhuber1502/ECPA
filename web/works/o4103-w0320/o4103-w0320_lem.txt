Apollo and Daphne.

a epigram.

when Phoebus be amorous, and long to be rude,
 miss Daphne cry pish! and run swift to the wood,
 and rather than do such a naughty affair,
 she become a fine laurel to deck the God hair. 

the nymph be, no doubt, of a cold constitution;
 for sure to turn tree be a odd resolution! 
yet in this she behave like a true modern spouse,
 for she flee from his arm to distinguish his brow.
