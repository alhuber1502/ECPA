APOLLO and DAPHNE.

An EPIGRAM.

WHEN Phoebus was am'rous, and long'd to be rude,
 Miss Daphne cry'd Pish! and ran swift to the wood,
 And rather than do such a naughty affair,
 She became a fine laurel to deck the God's hair. 

The nymph was, no doubt, of a cold constitution;
 For sure to turn tree was an odd resolution! 
Yet in this she behav'd like a true modern spouse,
 For she fled from his arms to distinguish his brows.
