love revenge.

a song.

i 

the world be hush, and nature lie
lull in a soft repose,
as i in tear reflect lie
on chloe faithless vow,
the god of love all gay appear
to heal my wound heart,
new pang of joy my soul endear,
and pleasure charm each part.
fond man, say he, here end thy woe,
till they my power and justice know,
the foolish sex will all do so.

ii.

and for thy ease believe, no bliss
be perfect without pain,
the fair summer hurtful be
without some shower of rain;
the joy of heaven, who will prize
if man too cheap buy,
the dear part of mortal joy
most charm be when seek;
and though with dross true love they pay
those that know fine metal say,
no gold will coin without allay.

iii.

but that the generous lover may,
not always sigh in vain,
the cruel nymph that kill to day,
to morrow shall be slay.
the little god no soon speak,
but from my sight he slay,
and i that groan with Chloes yoke
find love revenge be true;
her proud hard heart too late do turn
with fierce flame than mine do burn,
while i as much begin to scorn.
