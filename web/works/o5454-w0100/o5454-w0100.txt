SONG X.

Solemn Thoughts of GOD and Death.

I.

THere is a GOD that reigns above,
 LORD of the Heav'ns and Earth and Seas:
 I fear his Wrath, I ask his Love,
 And with my Lips I sing his Praise,

II.

There is a Law which he has writ,
 To teach us all that we must do:
 My Soul, to his Commands submit,
 For they are holy, just and true. 

III.

There is a Gospel of rich Grace,
 Whence Sinners all their Comforts draw:
 LORD, I repent, and seek thy Face;
 For I have often broke thy Law. 

IV.

There is an Hour when I must die,
 Nor do I know how soon 'twill come;
 A thousand Children young as I,
 Are call'd by Death to hear their Doom. 

V.

Let me improve the Hours I have,
 Before the Day of Grace is fled;
 There's no Repentance in the Grave,
 Nor Pardons offer'd to the Dead. 

VI.

Just as the Tree cut down, that fell
 To North or Southward, there it lies;
 So Man departs to Heav'n or Hell,
 Fix'd in the State wherein he dies.
