song x. 

solemn thought of god and death.

i 

there be a god that reign above,
 lord of the heaven and earth and sea:
 i fear his wrath, i ask his love,
 and with my lip i sing his praise,

ii.

there be a law which he have write,
 to teach we all that we must do:
 my soul, to his command submit,
 for they be holy, just and true. 

iii.

there be a gospel of rich grace,
 whence sinner all their comfort draw:
 lord, i repent, and seek thy face;
 for i have often break thy law. 

iv.

there be a hour when i must die,
 nor do i know how soon it will come;
 a thousand child young as i,
 be call by death to hear their doom. 

v. 

let i improve the hour i have,
 before the day of grace be flee;
 there be no repentance in the grave,
 nor pardon offer to the dead. 

vi.

just as the tree cut down, that fall
 to north or southward, there it lie;
 so man depart to heaven or hell,
 fix in the state wherein he die.
