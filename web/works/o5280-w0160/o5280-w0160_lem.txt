address to the wind.

suppose to be write by a lady during the absence of her lover.

to miss Munroe.

you ruthless wind, who boisterous sweep
 awake to rage the boil deep;
 who mock the seaman fruitless toil,
 and ocean glut with frequent spoil;
 to i restore the favour youth,
 who, kneel, vow eternal truth;
 who tender tale, devoid of art,
 have charm my soul, and win my heart;
 O! swift from india venal strand,
 conduct he to his native land;
 his wealth to you i here resign,
 his tender heart alone be i.
