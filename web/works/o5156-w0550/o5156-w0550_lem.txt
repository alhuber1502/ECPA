a song upon miss HARRIET Hanbury, address to the reverend mr. BIRT. 

by the same.

i 

dear doctor of saint Mary,
in the hundred of bergavenny,
i have see such a lass,
with a shape and a face,
as never be match by any.

ii.

such wit, such bloom, and such beauty,
have this girl of Ponty pool, sir,
with eye that will make
the tough heart ache,
and the wise man a fool, sir.

iii.

at our fair other day she appear, sir,
and the welchmman all flock and view she;
and all of they say,
she be fit to have be make
a wife for Owen Tudor.

iv.

they will never have be tire with gaze,
and so much her charm do please, sir,
that all of they stay
till their ale grow dead,
and cold be their toast cheese, sir.

v. 

how happy the lord of the manor,
that shall be of her possess, sir;
for all must agree,
who my HARRIET shall see,
she be a Herriot of the best, sir.

vi.

then pray make a ballad about she;
we know you have wit if you will show it,
then do be ashamed,
you can never be blame,
for a prophet be often a poet.

vii.

but why do you make one yourself then?
i suppose i by you shall be tell, sir:
this beautiful piece,
alas, be my niece;
and beside she be but five year old, sir.

viii.

but though, my dear friend, she be no old,
in her face it may plain be see, sir,
that this angel at five,
will, if she be alive,
be a goddess at fifteen, sir.
