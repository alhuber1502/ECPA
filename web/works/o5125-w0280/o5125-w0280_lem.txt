to Artemisia.

dr. king invitation to bellvill: imitate.

if artemisia soul can dwell
 four hour in a tiny cell,
 (to give that space of bliss to i)
 i wait my happiness at three. 
our Tommy in a jug shall bring
 clear nectar from the bubble spring:
 the cup shall on the table stand,
 the sugar and the spoon at hand:
 a skilful hand shall likewise spread
 soft butter on the yield bread;
 and (as you eat but mighty little,
 and seem a arrant foe to victual)
 you will cry perhaps, one bit may do,
 but i be resolve it shall be two:
 with you and your Amanda bless,
 care fly away from mira breast;
 over stubborn flax no more i grieve,
 but stick the needle on my sleeve:
 for let they work on holiday,
 who will be idle when they may:
 if i must fret and labour too,
 like caricus and lumberloo;
 as well i may, like simoneer,
 be plague with sixty pound a year. 
what nymph, that be eloquent and gay,
 but owe it chief to her tea? 
with satire that supply our tongue,
 and great help the fail lung. 
by that assist we can spy
 a fault with microscopic eye;
 dissect a prude with wondrous art,
 and read the care of delia heart. 
now to the company we fall,
 it be i and Mira that be all:
 more will you have â€” dear madam, then
 count i and Mira over again.
