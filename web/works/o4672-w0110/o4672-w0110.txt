GOD's Infinity.

I.

SOME Seraph, lend your Heavenly Tongue,
 Or Harp of Golden String,
 That I may raise a lofty Song
 To our Eternal King. 

II.

Thy Names, how Infinite they be! 
Great Everlasting One! 
Boundless thy Might and Majesty,
 And Unconfin'd thy Throne. 

III.

Thy Glories shine of Wondrous Size,
 And wondrous Large thy Grace,
 Immortal Day breaks from thine Eyes,
 And Gabriel Vails his Face. 

IV.

Thine Essence is a vast Abyss
 Which Angels cannot sound,
 An Ocean of Infinities
 Where all our thoughts are drownd. 

V.

The Mysteries of Creation lie
 Beneath Enlightned Minds,
 Thoughts can ascend above the Sky,
 And fly before the Winds. 

VI.

Reason may grasp the Massie Hills,
 And stretch from Pole to Pole,
 But Half thy Name our Spirit fills,
 And Overloads our Soul. 

VII.

In vain our Haughty Reason swells,
 For Nothing's found in Thee
 But Boundless Unconceivables,
 And Vast Eternity.
