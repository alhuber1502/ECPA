To the Right Honourable John Earl of Orrery, at Bath, after the Death of the late Earl. 

'Tis said, for ev'ry common Grief
 The Muses can afford Relief:
 And, surely, on that heav'nly Train
 A Boyle can never call in vain. 
Then strait invoke the sacred Nine,
 Nor impious slight their Gifts divine;
 Dispel those Clouds, which damp your Fire;
 Shew, Bath, like Tunbridge, can inspire.
