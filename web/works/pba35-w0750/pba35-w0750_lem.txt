to the right honourable John earl of orrery, at bath, after the death of the late earl. 

it be say, for every common grief
 the muse can afford relief:
 and, sure, on that heavenly train
 a Boyle can never call in vain. 
then strait invoke the sacred nine,
 nor impious slight their gift divine;
 dispel those cloud, which damp your fire;
 show, bath, like Tunbridge, can inspire.
