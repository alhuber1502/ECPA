 i  for a grotto.

to i, who in their lay the shepherd call
Actaea, daughter of the neighbour stream,
this cave belong. the figtree and the vine,
which over the rocky entrance downward shoot,
be place by Glycon. he with cowslip pale,
primrose, and purple lychnis, deck the green
before my threshold, and my shelve wall
with honeysuckle cover. here at noon,
lull by the murmur of my rise fount,
i slumber: here my cluster fruit i tend;
or from the humid flower, at break of day,
fresh garland weave, and chace from all my bound
each thing impure or noxious. enter-in,
o stranger, undismayed. nor bat nor toad
here lurk: and if thy breast of blameless thought
approve thou, not unwelcome shall thou tread
my quiet mansion: chief, if thy name
wise Pallas and the immortal muse own.
