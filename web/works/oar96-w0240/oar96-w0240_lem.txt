a poem

occasion by the report of the queen death.

when fame have blow among the western swain,
 the sad news that ever reach their plain,
 like thunder in my ear the sound do break;
 the kill accent which i dare not speak. 
less be i touch with that pernicious dart,
 that pierce through i to reach my daphnes heart,
 from off my head the florid wreath i tear,
 that i, to please the fond Orestes, wear;
 and quite over charge with grief upon the ground,
 i sink my brow, with mournful cypress crown;
 my tremble hand sustain my droop head,
 and at my foot my lire and song be lay;
 it be in a gloomy shade, where over and over
 i'de mourn my love companion loss before;
 but now i vain strive my thought to expose,
 in number kind, and sensible as those
 for, ah! the potent ill that fill my breast,
 be much to vast and black to be express
