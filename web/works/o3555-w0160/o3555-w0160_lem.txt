song iv.

when gentle Celia first i know,
 a breast so good, so kind, so true,
 reason and taste approve;
 please to indulge so pure a flame,
 i call it by too soft a name,
 and fond think i love. 

till Chloris come, with sad surprise
 i feel the lightning of her eye
 through all my sense run;
 all glow with resistless charm,
 she fill my breast with new alarm,
 i see, and be undo. 

o Celia! dear unhappy maid,
 forbear the weakness to upbraid
 which ought your scorn to move;
 i know this beauty false and vain,
 i know she triumph in my pain,
 yet still i feel i love. 

thy gentle smile no more can please,
 nor can thy soft friendship ease
 the torment i endure;
 think what that wound breast must feel
 which truth and kindness can heal,
 nor even thy pity cure. 

oft shall i curse my iron chain,
 and wish again thy mild reign
 with long and vain regret;
 all that i can, to thou i give,
 and can i still to reason live
 i be thy captive yet. 

but passion wild impetuous sea
 hurry i far from peace and thou;
 it be vain to struggle more:
 thus the poor sailor slumber lie,
 while swell tide around he rise,
 and push his bark from shore. 

in vain he spread his helpless arm,
 his pity friend with fond alarm
 in vain deplore his state;
 still far and farther from the coast,
 on the high surge his bark be toss,
 and founder yield to fate.
