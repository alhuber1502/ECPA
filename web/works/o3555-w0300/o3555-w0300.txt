HYMN V.

AWAKE, my soul, lift up thine eyes;
 See where thy foes against thee rise,
 In long array, a numerous host;
 Awake, my soul, or thou art lost. 

Here giant danger threat'ning stands
 Mustering his pale terrific bands;
 There pleasure's silken banners spread,
 And willing souls are captive led. 

See where rebellious passions rage,
 And fierce desires and lusts engage;
 The meanest foe of all the train
 Has thousands and ten thousands slain. 

Thou tread'st upon enchanted ground,
 Perils and snares beset thee round;
 Beware of all, guard every part,
 But most, the traitor in thy heart. 

Come then, my soul, now learn to wield
 The weight of thine immortal shield;
 Put on the armour from above
 Of heavenly truth and heavenly love. 

The terror and the charm repel,
 And powers of earth, and powers of hell;
 The man of Calvary triumph'd here;
 Why should his faithful followers fear?
