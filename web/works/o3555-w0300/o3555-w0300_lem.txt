hymn v. 

awake, my soul, lift up thy eye;
 see where thy foe against thou rise,
 in long array, a numerous host;
 awake, my soul, or thou be lose. 

here giant danger threaten stand
 muster his pale terrific band;
 there pleasure silken banner spread,
 and will soul be captive lead. 

see where rebellious passion rage,
 and fierce desire and lust engage;
 the mean foe of all the train
 have thousand and ten thousand slay. 

thou tread upon enchant ground,
 peril and snare beset thou round;
 beware of all, guard every part,
 but most, the traitor in thy heart. 

come then, my soul, now learn to wield
 the weight of thy immortal shield;
 put on the armour from above
 of heavenly truth and heavenly love. 

the terror and the charm repel,
 and power of earth, and power of hell;
 the man of Calvary triumph here;
 why shall his faithful follower fear?
