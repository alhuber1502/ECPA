to a lady, who command i to send she a account in verse, how i succeed in my subscription.

how i succeed, you kind ask;
 yet set i on a grievous task,
 when you oblige i to rehearse,
 the censure past upon my verse. 

though i with pleasure may relate,
 that many, true good, and great,
 with candid eye my line survey,
 and smile upon the artless lay;
 to those with grateful heart i bend —
 but your command i must attend. 

SERVILLA cry, i hate a wit;
 woman shall to their fate submit,
 shall in the needle take delight;
 it be out of character to write:
 she may succeed among the man;
 they tell i, swift subscribe for ten;
 and some say, Dorset do the same;
 but she shall never have my name:
 her poetry have cost i dear;
 when lady Carteret be here,
 the widow Gordon get my guinea;
 for which i own myself a ninny. 

OLIVIA lose oft at play;
 so will not throw her gold away. 

thus Silvia, of the haughty tribe:
 she never ask i to subscribe,
 nor ever write a line on i,
 i be no theme for poetry! 
she right judge; i have no taste —
 for women poetry, at least. 

then Fulvia make this sage reply;
 (and look with self-sufficient eye:)
 i oft have say, and say again,
 verse be only write by man;
 i know a woman can write;
 i do not say this out of spite;
 nor shall be think, by those who know i,
 to envy one so much below i. 

Sabina, fame in wisdom school,
 allow i write — but be a fool:
 "what! — must our son be form by rhyme? 
"a fine way to employ one time! " 

Albino have no gold to waste,
 far go in the italian taste:
 he vow he must subscribe this year,
 to keep dear carestini here;
 not from a narrow party view;
 he dote on senesino too;
 by turn their interest he will espouse;
 he be for the public good, he vow;
 a generous ardor fire his breast. 
hail, Britain, in such patriot bless! 

say belvidera, since a wit
 or friend or foe alike will hit,
 deliver i from wit, i say;
 grant heaven, they never may cross my way! 
beside, i oft have hear it hint,
 her poem never will be print:
 her sickness be a feint, no doubt,
 to keep her book from come out. 

of wit, say Celia, i will acquit she;
 then arch fall into a titter. 

a female bard! Pulvillio cry;
 it be possible she may be wise;
 but i can never find it yet,
 though oft in company we meet:
 she talk just in the common way:
 sure wit their talent shall display;
 their language sure shall be bright,
 before they shall pretend to write:
 i will never subscribe for book, say he;
 before god, it look like pedantry. 

highborn Belinda love to blame;
 on criticism found her fame:
 whenever she think a fault she spy
 how pleasure sparkle in her eye! 
call it not poetry, she say;
 no — call it rhyme, if you please:
 her number may adorn a ring,
 or serve along the street to sing:
 Stella and flavia well enough;
 what else i see, be stupid stuff;
 nor love nor satire in her lay,
 insipid! neither pain nor please:
 i promise once to patronize she;
 but on reflection, i be wise:
 yet i subscribe among the rest;
 i love to carry on a jest. 

Belinda thus her anger show,
 nor tell the world, from whence it flow:
 with more success to wound my lay,
 she gild the dart with other praise:
 to her own breast i leave the fair
 convince i stand acquit there. 

Amanda, your command, you see,
 though grievous, be obey by i. 
what my friend tell i have be say,
 just as it come into my head,
 no matter for the place or time,
 to show your power, i tag with rhyme. 

now let some news salute your ear,
 though i have weary you, i fear:
 know, — have vengeance vow,
 and in the fury temple bow:
 he but suspend his wrath, he say,
 till he can criticise my lay. 
malice, thy rancour i expect,
 and shall return it — with neglect:
 go on, display your treasure rage;
 invective shall not blot my page:
 what real fault you note, i will mend:
 proceed, your effort i attend;
 teach early, Dryden, by thy song,
 they never forgive, who do the wrong. 

now to the muse i bid adieu;
 nor rail at she, as poet do:
 protect by the good and great,
 i will not repine, but bless my fate. 

you, madam, who your sex adorn,
 who malice and detraction scorn,
 who with superior sense be bless,
 of every real worth possess;
 with eye indulgent view my lay:
 you know to blame, but love to praise:
 you know my fault, and know beside,
 i want not to be mortify. 
one merit i presume to boast,
 and dare to plead but one at most:
 the muse i never have debase;
 my lay be innocent at least;
 be ever ardent design
 to mend and to enlarge the mind. 
this must be own a virtuous aim. 
the praise of wit — let other claim.
