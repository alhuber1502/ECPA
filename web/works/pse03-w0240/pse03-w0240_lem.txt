song on madam s.

though the amorous beau,
 so courtly and fine,
 admire a dress,
 and face of fifteen. 

let orinda but speak,
 her tongue will surprise,
 and make he her slave,
 spite of celia bright eye. 

be she old and deform,
 her wit and her air,
 will conquer more heart,
 than the young and the fair. 

those charm be more noble,
 the lovely and kind
 may vanquish the body,
 she conquer the mind.
