Song on Madam Sâ€”.

Tho' the Amorous Beau,
 So courtly and fine,
 Admire a Dress,
 And Face of fifteen. 

Let Orinda but speak,
 Her Tongue will surprize,
 And make him her Slave,
 Spight of Celia's bright Eyes. 

Was she old and deform'd,
 Her Wit and her Air,
 Would conquer more Hearts,
 Than the Young and the Fair. 

Those Charms are more noble,
 The Lovely and Kind
 May vanquish the Body,
 She conquers the Mind.
