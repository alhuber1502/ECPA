FROM DELIA TO ALONZO. 

WHEN Adam was in spacious Eden plac'd,
 Where rural sweets luxuriant did abound,
 All that could charm the eye or please the taste,
 In this blest scene of happiness was found. 

O'er wide creation, he an empire sway'd:
 The creatures all with whom the world was stor'd,
 His sov'reign mandates with delight obey'd,
 And own'd him as their universal lord. 

What would he more, to render bless complete? 
You say he lack'd the sweets of social life,
 Until fair Eve, with charms divinely sweet,
 Became his friend, his partner, and his wife

But think, fond youth, how transient was the bliss,
 Scarce had he felt the joys of mutual love,
 Scarce had he once receiv'd th' ambrosial kiss,
 When ah! his darling did his ruin prove! 

Did she, who was adorn'd with ev'ry grace,
 Prove fatal to the father of mankind? 
Who of her daughters, a degen'rate race,
 Can boast more art the tranquil hours to bind? 

To sue for better, sir, would be in vain:
 None ever yet did mother Eve excel. 
Be warn'd by Adam; shun the glitt'ring train,
 Lest some fond nymph your pleasures all expel. 

A single life we find replete with joys,
 The matrimonial chain I ever dread,
 A state of celibacy is my choice;
 Therefore Alonzo never can succeed.
