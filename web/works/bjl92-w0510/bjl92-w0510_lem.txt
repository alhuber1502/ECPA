from Delia to Alonzo. 

when Adam be in spacious Eden place,
 where rural sweet luxuriant do abound,
 all that can charm the eye or please the taste,
 in this bless scene of happiness be find. 

over wide creation, he a empire sway:
 the creature all with who the world be store,
 his sovereign mandate with delight obey,
 and own he as their universal lord. 

what will he more, to render bless complete? 
you say he lack the sweet of social life,
 until fair eve, with charm divine sweet,
 become his friend, his partner, and his wife

but think, fond youth, how transient be the bliss,
 scarce have he feel the joy of mutual love,
 scarce have he once receive the ambrosial kiss,
 when ah! his darling do his ruin prove! 

do she, who be adorn with every grace,
 prove fatal to the father of mankind? 
who of her daughter, a degenerate race,
 can boast more art the tranquil hour to bind? 

to sue for better, sir, will be in vain:
 none ever yet do mother eve excel. 
be warn by Adam; shun the glitter train,
 lest some fond nymph your pleasure all expel. 

a single life we find replete with joy,
 the matrimonial chain i ever dread,
 a state of celibacy be my choice;
 therefore Alonzo never can succeed.
