Bryan and pereene.

a west indian ballad;

found on a real fact, that happen a few year ago in the island of saint Christopher.

the northeast wind do brisk blow,
 the ship be safe moor,
 young Bryan think the boat crew slow,
 and so leap overboard. 

pereene, the pride of indian dame,
 his heart long hold in thrall,
 and whoso his impatience blame,
 i wot, never love at all. 

a long, long year, one month and day,
 he dwell on english land,
 nor once in thought will ever stray,
 though lady seek his hand. 

for Bryan he be tall and strong,
 right blithesome roll his een,
 sweet be his voice whenever he sing,
 he scant have twenty see. 

but who the countless charm can draw,
 that grace his mistress true;
 such charm the old world never see,
 nor oft i ween the new. 

her raven hair play round her neck,
 like tendril of the vine;
 her cheek red dewy rose bud deck,
 her eye like diamond shine. 

soon as his well know ship she spy,
 she cast her weed away,
 and to the palmy shore she hie,
 all in her best array. 

in sea-green silk so neat clad,
 she there impatient stand;
 the crew with wonder see the lad
 repel the foam flood. 

her hand a handkerchief display,
 which he at part give;
 well please the token he survey,
 and manly beat the wave. 

her fair companion one and all,
 rejoice crowd the strand;
 for now her lover swim in call,
 and almost touch the land. 

then through the white surf do she haste,
 to clasp her lovely swain;
 when, ah! a shark bit through his waist:
 his heart blood die the main! 

he shriek! his half spring from the wave,
 stream with purple gore,
 and soon it find a live grave,
 and, ah! be see no more. 

now haste, now haste, you maid, i pray,
 fetch water from the spring:
 she fall, she fall, she dye away,
 and soon her knell they ring. 

now each may-morning round her tomb
 you fair, fresh flowret strew,
 so may your lover scape his doom,
 her hapless fate scape you.
