act iv. 29. 

i 

captain of my salvation, hear! 
stir up thy strength and bow the sky
 be thou the god of battle near;
 in all thy majesty arise! 

ii.

the day, the dreadful day at hand! 
in battle cover thou my head:
 past be thy word: i here demand,
 and confident expect thy aid. 

iii.

now arm i for the threaten fight
 now let thy power descend from high,
 triumphant in thy spirit may
 so shall i every foe defy. 

iv.

i ask thy help; by thou send forth
 thy glorious gospel to proclaim,
 be thou my mouth, and shake the earth,
 and spread by i thy awful name. 

v. 

steel i to shame, reproach, disgrace,
 arm i with all thy armour now,
 set like a flint my steady face,
 harden to adamant my brow. 

vi.

bold may i wax, exceed bold
 my high commission to perform,
 nor shrink thy harsh truth to unfold,
 but more than meet the gather storm. 

vii.

adverse to earth rebellious throng,
 still may i turn my fearless face,
 stand as a iron pillar strong,
 and steadfast as a wall of brass. 

viii.

give i thy may, thou god of power;
 then let or man or fiend assail! 
strong in thy strength, i will stand a tower
 impregnable to earth or hell.
