sonnet.

experience all silvered with age,
ah! vain thou visit i;
oh! go and the youthful engage,
to take thou through life trouble sea.

ah! lead they while bloom and gay,
to treasure of wisdom a store;
prosperity may pass away,
and leave its possessor no more.

attract they while habit be young,
to pleasure by virtue refine,
and bid they content to prolong,
in youth firm strengthen the mind.

for kindred, most love and dear,
and friendship, that charm of the soul;
rich cordial life be journey to cheer,
have oft bitterness mix in their bowl.

nor innocence fame can secure,
it fade with the blast of a breath;
if virtue our bliss will insure,
she point to a state beyond death.
