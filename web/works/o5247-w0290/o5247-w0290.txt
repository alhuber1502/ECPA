In Answer to Consolatory Verses wrote by a Friend.

WITH Ease Advice to virtuous Woe we give,
 But ah! how few by Stoick Rules can live? 
Virtue distrest in melting Verse appears;
 Beauteous in Misery, and adorn'd in Tears. 
But in the World 'tis view'd with other Eyes;
 Virtue in Rags is Beauty in Disguise;
 And can no more Contempt and Scorn disarm,
 Then a fair Face behind a Masque can charm. 
Whatever Gifts we may to Nature owe,
 Success is all our Merit here below. 
By Fortune favour'd Fools may rise to Fame;
 Without it Virtue is an empty Name.
