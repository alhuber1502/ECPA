sonnet [50] l.  from the novel of Celestina. 

farewell, you lawn! by fond remembrance bless,
 as witness of gay unclouded hour;
 where, to maternal friendship bosom press,
 my happy childhood pass amid your bower. 
you woodwalk wild! — where leaf and fairy flower
 by spring luxuriant hand be strew anew;
 rock! whence with shadowy grace rude nature lower
 over glen and haunt stream! — a long adieu! 
and you! — oh promise happiness! — who voice
 delude fancy hear in every grove,
 bid this tender, trust heart rejoice
 in the bright prospect of unfailing love:
 though lose to i — still may thy smile serene
 bless the dear lord — of this regret scene.
