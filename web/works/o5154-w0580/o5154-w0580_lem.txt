on a bay-leaf, pluck from virgil tomb near Naples.

1736. 

by the same.

bold be the irreligious hand,
that can all reverence withstand,
and sacrilegious presume
to rob the poet sacred tomb
of so much honourable shade,
as this, so small a trophy, make;
can dare to pluck from virgil brow
the honour nature do bestow,

sweet the gentle goddess smile,
and listen to her favourite child;
whether in shepherd clean weed
he deft tune his oaten reed,
and teach the vocal wood around
his Amaryllis to resound;

or teach he in a grave strain
to cloth the field with wave grain;
and in the marriage-fold to twine
the barren elm, and cluster vine;
to yoke the labour ox, to breed
to the know goal the foam steed;
and sing the manner, right, degree,
and labour of the frugal bee;

or whether with Aeneas' name
he swell the extend cheek of fame,
and all his god-like labour sing,
whence Rome extend glory spring;

the goddess smile, and own she know
the original from whence he draw,
and grateful she spontaneous give
this live honour to his grave.

hail, thou sweet shade, who reverence name
still foremost in the mouth of fame,
do preference and value give,
and teach this little leaf to live,
methinks seclude from that brow,
where grateful nature bad it grow,
this beauteous green shall fade away,
and yield to iron-toothed decay:
but virgil name forbid that crime,
and blunt the threaten scythe of time.
