to the lady. 

wife and servant be the same,
but only differ in the name:
for when that fatal knot be tie,
which nothing, nothing can divide:
when she the word obey have say,
and man by law supreme have make,
then all that be kind be lay aside,
and nothing leave but state and pride:
fierce as a eastern prince he grow,
and all his innate rigor show:
then but to look, to laugh, or speak,
will the nuptial contract break.
like mute she sign alone must make,
and never any freedom take:
but still be govern by a nod,
and fear her husband as her god:
he still must serve, he still obey,
and nothing act, and nothing say,
but what her haughty lord think fit,
who with the power, have all the wit.
then shun, oh! shun that wretched state,
and all the fawn flatterer hate:
value your self, and man despise,
you must be proud, if you will be wise.
