An INSCRIPTION on the TOMB,

Raised to the memory of the author's father, and of others his ancestors.

By the Same.

UNmark'd by trophies of the great and vain,
Here sleeps in silent tombs a gentle train.
No folly wasted their paternal store,
No guilt, no sordid av'rice made it more;
With honest fame, and sober plenty crown'd,
They liv'd and spread their cheering influence round.
May he whose hand this pious tribute pays,
Receive a like return of filial praise!
