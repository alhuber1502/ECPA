a inscription on the tomb,

raise to the memory of the author father, and of other his ancestor.

by the same.

unmarked by trophy of the great and vain,
here sleep in silent tomb a gentle train.
no folly waste their paternal store,
no guilt, no sordid avarice make it more;
with honest fame, and sober plenty crown,
they live and spread their cheer influence round.
may he who hand this pious tribute pay,
receive a like return of filial praise!
