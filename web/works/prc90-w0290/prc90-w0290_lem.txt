on a lady

for thou, Eliza, darling theme,
 too weak be all the stroke of art,
 who lovely eye reflect beam
 go thrill through the painter heart. 

as some young eagle, when it fail
 before the sun be too scorch ray,
 begin to pant for fan gale,
 and sicken at the brilliant gaze;

so while the artist draw that form,
 where every beauty be express,
 his rapture fancy grow too warm,
 and love light torch in his breast. 

and oh! as ill the poet try
 to paint the charm that deck thy mind;
 no, that his utmost skill defy,
 angelic sweetness there we find. 

then, peerless maid, it be all in vain
 to say how bright thy beauty shine,
 for every look express plain. 
the hand that form thou be divine.
