on the five of December, be the birthday of a beautiful young lady.

ode v. 

i 

hail, old of the monthly train,
 sire of the winter drear,
 December, in who iron reign
 expire the chequer year. 
hush all the bluster blast that blow,
 and proud plume in silver snow,
 smile glad on this bless of day. 
the livery cloud shall on thou wait,
 and Phoebus shine in all his state
 with more than summer ray. 

ii.

though jocund June may just boast
 long day and happy hour,
 though august be pomona host,
 and may be crown with flower;
 tell June, his fire and crimson die,
 by harriot blush and harriot eye,
 eclipse and vanquish, fade away:
 tell august, thou can let he see
 a rich, riper fruit than he,
 a sweet flower than may.
