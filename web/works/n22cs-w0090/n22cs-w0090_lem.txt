sonnet [09] ix.

bless be yond shepherd, on the turf recline,
 who, on the vary cloud which float above,
 lie idle gaze — while his vacant mind
 pour out some tale antique of rural love! 
ah! he have never feel the pang that move
 the indignant spirit, when with selfish pride,
 friend, on who faith the trust heart rely,
 unkind shun the implore eye of woe! 
the ill they ought to soothe, with taunt deride,
 and laugh at tear themselves have force to flow. 
nor his rude bosom those fine feeling melt,
 child of sentiment and knowledge bear,
 through who each shaft with cruel force be feel
 empoison by deceit — or barb with scorn.
