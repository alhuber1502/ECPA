my own epitaph.

here lie a true maid, deform and old;
 who, that she never be handsome, never need be tell. 
though she never have a lover, much friendship have meet;
 and think all mankind quite out of her debt. 
she never can forgive, for she never have resent;
 as she never have deny, so she never repent. 
she love the whole species, but some have distinguish;
 but time and much thought have all passion extinguish. 
though not fond of her station, content with her lot;
 a favour receive she have never forget. 
she rejoice in the good that her neighbour possess,
 and piety, purity, truth she profess. 
she live in much peace, but never court pleasure;
 her book and her pen have her moment of leisure. 
please with life, fond of health, yet fearless of death;
 believe she lose not her soul with her breath.
