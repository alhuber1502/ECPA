a inscription.

quercus loquitur. o you!

who by retirement to these sacred grove
impregnate fancy, and on think divine
build harmony — if sudden glow your breast
with inspiration, and the rapturous song
burst from a mind unconscious whence it spring:

— know that the sister of these hallow haunt,
dryad or hamadryad, though no more
from Jove to man prophetic truth they sing;
be still attendant on the lonely bard,
who step by step these silent wood among
wander contemplative, lift the soul
from low care, by every whisper breeze
tune the poetic mood; and fill the mind
with truth oracular, themselves of old
deign utter from the dodonean shrine.
