HYMN after the Sacrament.

I.

SONS of GOD, triumphant rise,
 Shout th' accomplish'd Sacrifice! 
Shout Your Sins in CHRIST forgiv'n,
 Sons of GOD, and Heirs of Heav'n! 

II.

Ye that round our Altars throng,
 List'ning Angels join the Song:
 Sing with Us, ye Heav'nly Pow'rs,
 Pardon, Grace, and Glory Ours! 

III.

Love's Mysterious Work is done! 
Greet we now th' accepted Son,
 Heal'd and quickned by his Blood,
 Join'd to CHRIST, and one with GOD. 

IV.

CHRIST, of all our Hopes the Seal;
 Peace Divine in CHRIST we feel,
 Pardon to our Souls applied:
 Dead for All, for Me he died! 

V.

Sin shall tyrannize no more,
 Purg'd its Guilt, dissolv'd its Pow'r;
 JESUS makes our Hearts his Throne,
 There he lives, and reigns alone. 

VI.

Grace our ev'ry Thought controuls,
 Heav'n is open'd in our Souls,
 Everlasting Life is won,
 Glory is on Earth begun. 

VII.

CHRIST in Us; in Him we see
 Fulness of the Deity. 
Beam of the eternal Beam;
 Life Divine we taste in Him! 

VIII.

Him we only taste below;
 Mightier Joys ordain'd to know
 Him when fully Ours we prove,
 Ours the Heav'n of perfect Love!
