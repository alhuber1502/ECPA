Cupid and Ganymede.

in heaven, one holiday, you read
 in wise Anacreon, Ganymede
 draw heedless Cupid in, to throw
 a main, to pass a hour, or so. 
the little trojan, by the way,
 by Hermes teach, play all the play. 

the god unhappy engage,
 by nature rash, by play enrage,
 complain, and sigh, and cry, and fret;
 lose every earthly thing he bet:
 in ready money, all the store
 pick up long since from danae shower;
 a snush-box, set with bleed heart,
 ruby, all pierce with diamond dart;
 his ninepin, make of myrtle wood;
 (the tree in ida forest stand)
 his bowl pure gold, the very same
 which Paris give the cyprian dame;
 two table-book in shagreen cover;
 fill with good verse from real lover;
 merchandise rare! a billet-doux,
 it be matter passionate, yet true:
 heap of hair ring, and cypher seal;
 rich trifle; serious bagatelle. 

what sad disorder play beget! 
desperate and mad, at length he set
 those dart, who point make god adore
 his may, and deprecate his power:
 those dart, whence all our joy and pain
 arise: those dart â€” come, seven the main,
 cry Ganymede: the usual trick:
 seven, slur a six; eleven: a nick. 

ill news go fast: it be quick know,
 that simple Cupid be undo. 
swift than lightning Venus fly:
 too late she find the thing too true. 
guess how the goddess greet her son:
 come hither, sirrah; no, begone;
 and, hark you, be it so indeed? 
a comrade you for Ganymede? 
a imp as wicked, for his age,
 as any earthly lady page;
 a scandal and a scourge to Troy:
 a prince son? a blackguard boy:
 a sharp, that with box and dice
 draw in young deity to vice. 
all heaven be by the ear together,
 since first that little rogue come hither:
 Juno she self have have no peace:
 and true I have be favour less:
 for Jove, as fame report, (but fame
 say thing not fit for i to name)
 have act ill for such a god,
 and take way extreme odd. 

and thou, unhappy child, she say
 (her anger by her grief allay)
 unhappy child, who thus have lose
 all the estate we ever can boast;
 whither, o whither will thou run,
 thy name despise, thy weakness know? 
nor shall thy shrine on earth be crown:
 nor shall thy power in heaven be own;
 when thou, nor man, nor god can wound. 

obedient Cupid kneel cry,
 cease, dear mother, cease to chide:
 gany a cheat, and i be a bubble:
 yet why this great excess of trouble? 
the dice be false: the dart be go:
 yet how be you, or i undo? 

the loss of these i can supply
 with keen shaft from cloe eye:
 fear not, we ever can be disgrace,
 while that bright magazine shall last:
 your crowd altar still shall smoke;
 and man your friendly aid invoke:
 Jove shall again revere your power,
 and rise a swan, or fall a shower.
