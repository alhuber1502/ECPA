On Sight of some Martyr's Sepulchres.

HEre lies Dust Confus'dly hurl'd,
But Dust that once shall judge the World! 
Blest Saints, when the quick Flames Enlarg'd
Your Souls, and from dull Flesh discharg'd,
Th'Ambitious Fires strove to Convey
Your Spirits on their tryumphant Way,
But wing'd with Glory They Aspird,
And lest the Flames behind them Tir'd.
