on sight of some martyr sepulchre.

here lie dust confuse hurl,
but dust that once shall judge the world! 
bless saint, when the quick flame enlarge
your soul, and from dull flesh discharge,
ambitious fire strive to convey
your spirit on their triumphant way,
but winge with glory they aspird,
and lest the flame behind they tire.
