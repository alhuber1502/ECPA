to Mira. invite she to a retreat in the country.

now spring return deck the year
 with all that be lovely, all that be fair;
 the field in lively green array,
 with deep gloom the silent shade;
 soft descend the gentle shower,
 and wake to life the spring flower;
 hence ambrosial sweet exhale,
 and various colour paint the vale;
 refresh air the zephyr blow,
 the stream with please murmur flow;
 while nightly amid the silent plain
 thy favourite bird renew her strain,
 come then, my Mira, come and share
 my joy, and breath a pure air. 
together let we range the plain,
 among the rustic nymph and swain;
 in rural dress, devoid of cure,
 give to the wind our flow hair,
 and round the meadow gayly roam,
 for youth do sober mirth become. 
now strain up you airy height,
 we will entertain the wander sight,
 with flowery field, and wave wood,
 hill and Dales, and fall flood:
 or to relieve the search eye,
 see distant spire and temple rise. 

come now, my Mira, let we rove
 together through the mazy grove;
 here, while with gentle pace we walk,
 beguile the time with please talk:
 here show thy melt eloquence,
 thy sprightly wit, thy manly sense;
 thy virtuous notion void of art,
 and while you charm, correct the heart. 

or now together careless lay,
 beneath a cypress spread shade,
 our thought to heavenly number raise,
 repeat pope harmonious lay,
 now Homer awful leaf turn over,
 or grave history explore;
 or study Plato sacred page,
 uncommon to our sex and age. 

now wander by the moon pale light,
 amid the silent shade of night,
 where on the late desert plain
 a please melancholy reign;
 soft through the rustle tree
 sob the sweet die breeze;
 the echo catch the plaintive sound,
 and gentle murmur breathe around. 
now sing, my friend, and let thy strain
 recount the art of faithless man:
 thy note, sweet philomel, shall join,
 and mix her soft complaint with thy. 

but raise, my Mira, raise thy song,
 to friendship noble strain belong. 
oh sing its tender chaste desire,
 its equal, pure, and last fire! 
such as in thy bosom burn,
 such as my fond soul return. 
friendship be but love refine,
 not weaken, but exalt the mind;
 and when its sacred power we prove,
 we guess how heavenly spirit love.
