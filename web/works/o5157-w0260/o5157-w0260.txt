VERSES occasioned by seeing a GROTTO built by Nine Sisters.

SO much this building entertains my sight,
Nought but the builders can give more delight;
In them the master-piece of Nature's shown,
In this I see Art's master-piece in stone.
O! Nature, Nature, thou hast conquer'd Art;
She charms the sight alone, but you the heart.
