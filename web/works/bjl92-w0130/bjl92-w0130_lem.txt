on the spring. 

now winter, reluctant, the sway
 resign to the genial spring;
 Sol shed a enliven ray,
 and warbler delightful sing. 

fresh verdure adorn the gay plain,
 so late overmantled with snow;
 the river, release from their chain,
 do now with soft murmur flow. 

the lark and the linnet unite,
 the cuckoo too join in the lay;
 all nature profuse of delight,
 and soft fan zephyr now play. 

how charm the garden appear? 
sweet primrose paint the gay vale:
 its head now the daffodil rear,
 the sweet of season to hail,

his team now the hind drive along;
 quite cheerful he plough the rude plain. 
he hum his love praise in a song,
 or whistle forget her disdain. 

the seed in the furrow he throw,
 indulge by bright phoebus ray;
 rich Ceres vast increase bestow,
 when autumn her bounty display. 

the lambkin now sport on the mead;
 they skip round the heath-covered hill;
 their dam how secure they feed
 by the side of yond murmur rill? 

near Damon appear with his lute,
 and wake the melodious lay;
 the songster, attentive and mute,
 be perch on the waver spray. 

as Phillis traverse the grove,
 all nature more charm appear:
 leander soft story of love,
 still touch find in her ear. 

they hand in hand trip over the plain;
 no couple more cheerful and gay:
 she count he the lovely swain;
 he call she the queen of the may. 

of each other heart they be sure;
 the art of no rival they dread. 
from mind so unsullied and pure,
 no treachery ever can proceed. 

few prince partake of such joy,
 remove from all faction and strife:
 sure riches and honour be toy,
 but they the endearment of life.
