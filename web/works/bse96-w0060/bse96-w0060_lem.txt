to time past.

write DEC.  1772. 

return, bless year! — when not the jocund spring,
 luxuriant summer, nor the amber hour
 calm autumn give, my heart invoke to bring
 joy, who rich balm over all the bosom pour;
 when never i wish may grace the close day
 one tint purpureal, or one golden ray;
 when the loud storm, that desolate the bower,
 find dear welcome than favonian gale,
 and winter bare, bleak field, than summer flowery vale! 

yet, not to deck pale hour with vain parade
 beneath the blaze of wide-illumined dome;
 not for the bound dance; — not to pervade,
 and charm the sense with music; — nor, as roam
 the mimic passion over theatric scene,
 to laugh, or weep; — o! not for these, i ween,
 but for delight that make the heart their home,
 be the grey night-frost on the sound plain
 more than the sun invoke, that gild the grassy lane. 

yes, for the joy that trivial joy excel,
 my love Honora, do we hail the gloom
 of dim november eve; — and as it fall,
 and the bright fire shine cheerful round the room,
 drop the warm curtain with no tardy hand;
 and feel our spirit, and our heart expand,
 listen their step, who still, wherever they come,
 make the keen star, that glaze the settle snow,
 more than the sun invoke, when first he tint the rose. 

affection, — friendship, — sympathy, — your throne
 be winter glow hearth; — and you be we,
 thy smile, Honora, make they all our own. —
 where be they now? — alas! their choice power
 fade at thy retreat; — for thou be go,
 and many a dark, long eve i sigh alone,
 in thril remembrance of the vanish hour,
 when storm be dear than the balmy gale,
 and winter bare bleak field than green luxuriant vale.
