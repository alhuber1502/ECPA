Written in the Conclusion of a Letter to Mr. Tickel, intreating him to recommend the Widow Gordon's Petition.

Eternal King, is there one Hour,
 To make me greatly bless'd? 
When shall I have it in my Pow'r
 To succour the Distress'd? 

In vain, alas! my Heart o'erflows
 With useless Tenderness;
 Why must I feel Another's Woes,
 And cannot make them less? 

Yet I this Torture must endure;
 'Tis not reserv'd for me
 To ease the Sighing of the Poor,
 Or set the Pris'ners free.
