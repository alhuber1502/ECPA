write in the conclusion of a letter to mr. tickel, entreat he to recommend the widow gordon petition.

eternal king, be there one hour,
 to make i great bless? 
when shall i have it in my power
 to succour the distress? 

in vain, alas! my heart overflow
 with useless tenderness;
 why must i feel another woe,
 and can make they less? 

yet i this torture must endure;
 it be not reserve for i
 to ease the sigh of the poor,
 or set the prisoner free.
