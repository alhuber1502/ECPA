sonnet [13] xiii. from Petrarch. 

oh! place i where the burn noon
 forbid the wither flower to blow;
 or place i in the frigid zone,
 on mountain of eternal snow:
 let i pursue the step of fame,
 or poverty more tranquil road;
 let youth warm tide my vein inflame,
 or sixty winter chill my blood:
 though my fond soul to heaven be fly,
 or though on earth it be doom to pine,
 prisoner or free â€” obscure or know,
 my heart, oh Laura! still be thy. 
whatever my destiny may be,
 that faithful heart, still burn for thou!
