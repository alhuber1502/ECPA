line in imitation of Cowley.

touch by thy wit, my soul on fire,
 my bosom throb with young desire. 
what! though thy form i never see,
 be there to man divulge a law
 that only what he see must touch his heart? 

the vulgar rule i disallow,
 and in my passion feel even now,
 that wit, like beauty, give the tender smart. 

methinks thy form i will not know,
 nor to thy face the pleasure owe
 of these delicious melt pain,
 which when a mortal once attain,
 he know the great bliss for man design. 

no, to my fancy i will apply,
 there find thy form, thy air, thy eye,
 and feast my frenzy with a zest refine. 

when in a pensive mood i sit,
 and melancholy take she fit,
 mild, tender, soft, thou shall appear,
 like the first blossom of the year:
 but when in brisk tide my spirit run,

l'allegro shall the pencil take,
 describe thy look, thy step, thy make,
 and show thou lively as bright maia son.
