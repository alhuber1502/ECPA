hymn on solitude.

by the late JAMES Thomson, ESQ; author of the season.

hail, ever-pleasing solitude!
companion of the wise and good!
but, from who holy, pierce eye,
the herd of fool, and villain fly.

oh! how i love with thou to walk!
and listen to thy whisper talk;
which innocence, and truth impart,
and melt the most obdurate heart.

a thousand shape you wear with ease,
and still in every shape you please;
now rapt in some mysterious dream,
a lone philosopher you seem;
now quick from hill to vale you fly,
and now you sweep the vault sky,
and nature triumph in your eye:
then strait again you court the shade,
and pine hang the pensive head.
a shepherd next you haunt the plain,
and warble forth your oaten strain.
a lover now with all the grace
of that sweet passion in your face!
then, soft-divided, you assume
the gentle-looking hâ€”d's bloom,
as, with her Philomela, she,
(her Philomela fond of thou)
amid the long withdraw vale,
awake the rival nightingale.
a thousand shape you wear with ease,
and still in every shape you please,

thy be the unbounded breath of morn,
just as the dew-bent rose be bear;
and while meridian fervour beat,
thy be the woodland dumb retreat;
but chief, when evening scene decay,
and the faint landskip swim away,
thy be the doubtful dear decline.
and that best hour of muse thy.

descend angel bless thy train,
the virtue of the sage, and swain;
plain innocence in white array,
and contemplation rear the head:
religion with her awful brow,
and rapt Urania wait on you.

oh, let i pierce thy secret cell!
and in thy deep recess dwell:
for ever with thy rapture fire,
for ever from the world retire;
nor by a mortal see, save he
a Lycidas, or Lycon be.
