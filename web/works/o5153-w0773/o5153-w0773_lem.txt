sonnet iv.

c**s, i hope the little heaven shall spare
of my short day, which flit away so fast,
and sickness threat with cloud to overcast,
in social converse oft with thou to share.

ill-luck for i, that wayward fate shall tear
thou from the haven thou have gain at last,
again to try the toil and danger pass
in foreign climate, and a hostile air:

yet duteous to thy country call attend,
which claim a portion of thy useful year,
and back with speed thy course to Britain bend.
if, ever again we meet, perchance shall end
my darken eve, thou will pay some friendly tear,
grateful to he, who live and die thy friend.
