to her grace the Dutchess of Manchester, and lady Diana spencer, now Dutchess of Bedford.

the humble petition of little Jemmy pen, at tunbridge-well.

madam, i hear, and hear with sorrow,
 that we be to lose your grace tomorrow;
 nor you alone, but lady di. 
where, thus desert, shall i fly? 
be i condemn to live in pain,
 till distant autumn come again? 
till time, in pity to my grief,
 shall bring you back to my relief? 

do not, relentless, let i moan;
 o take i, lady, as your own! 
though thousand have your rigour feel,
 let i your lovely bosom melt:
 since you to win my heart have deign,
 quit not the conquest you have gain:
 nor marlbro glorious footstep shun;
 he always keep the field he win.
