A SUNDAY EVENING's HYMN,

IN SICKNESS. 

MY fainting heart my God would praise,
And tune my trembling tongue;
Review his love thro' all my days,
And bid my faith be strong.

Tho' from his house his chast'ning hand,
Withheld my languid frame;
His altar in my heart shall stand,
And there I'll bless his name.

I'll count his mercies as they rose,
And thanks for each employ;
For nights of peace and calm repose,
And days of health and joy.

For friends, who form'd my mind with care,
For all my means of grace;
Shall impious doubts then check my prayer,
Tho' now he veils his face?

Resign'd, I wait a heavenly birth,
When God shall call me home;
Gently he weans my heart from earth,
My father bids me come.

If earthly sabbaths are no more,
I'll ask a seraph's lyre;
My spirit would delighted soar,
And join the heavenly choir.
