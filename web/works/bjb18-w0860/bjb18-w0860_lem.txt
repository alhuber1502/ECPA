saint JOHN xxi. 1. 

toil-worn upon their wavy sea,
 with empty net and waste store,
 the fisherman of Galilee
 be steer cheerless to the shore. 
but lo! upon the shelve strand,
 a form like one of abraham race,
 beckon with friendly outstretch hand,
 yet move with more than mortal grace. 

and word come waft on the wind, —
 "friend have you meat?" they answer "none." 
 "cast to the right and you shall find,"
 and to the right their net be throw:
 when all the treasure of the deep
 into their meshy cell be pour. 
who may it be? within they leap
 their yearn heart — "it be the lord." 

so he, traverse life broad main,
 who long have toil and nothing win,
 will feel how profitless and vain
 a worldling task when it be do! 
his hand hang listless by his side,
 with languid eye and gather brow,
 he wander, hope no more his guide,
 for what have she to offer now? 

but hark, a voice! he turn his head;
 a treasure rich before he lie;
 and ray of light from heaven be shed,
 to gleam the fair unfolded prize. 
who do this better gift impart,
 than earth or ocean can afford? 
o feel, and rouse thou, grateful heart! 
and glad own it be the lord.
