SCHOOL RHYMES FOR NEGRO CHILDREN.

HOW happy are we in that hour we love,
 When shadows grow longer and branches move;
 Blithe urchins then we be! 
From the school's low porch with a joyous shout,
 We rush and we run and we gambol about,
 So careless, light and free! 

And the good child merrily plays his part,
 For all is well in his guileless heart,
 The glance of his eye is bright. 
We hop and we leap and we toss the ball;
 Some dance to their shadows upon the wall,
 And spread out their hands with delight. 

The parrot that sits on her bough a-swinging,
 The bird and the butterfly, light air winging,
 Are scarcely more happy, I trow. 
Then hey for the meadow, the glade and the grove,
 For evening is coming and branches move,
 We'll have merry pastime now.
