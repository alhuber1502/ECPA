The Prospect.

FRom a tall Praecipice on the Sea-side,
A Rev'rend Hermite view'd the spreading Tide:
The Flood was curl'd with a becoming Wave;
But no Praesage of rising Tempests gave.
A goodly Ship was coasting by the Place,
Like a proud Courser foaming in her Pace;
With flatt'ring Courtship, the Lascivious Gails
Her Streamers curl'd, and wanton'd in her Sails.
The Waves divide to give the Pageant way;
Then close, and with rais'd Heads, the Pomp survey.
Whilst the grave Man this spectacle intends,
(Pleas'd with the sight) a suddain Storm descends.
The Winds grow rude, and rend the shaken Boat;
On the swoln Flood, the tatter'd Streamers float:
So, Blossoms with too violent a Breeze,
Are torn, and scatter'd round their shaken Trees.
Then, to his Cell return'd, the Anchorite
Draws sage Remarques from this Disastrous sight
Of Earthly Grandeur, weighs the Uncertain state;
Which, in its gawdiest Bloom, and proudest Height,
Stands most expos'd to th'Shock of suddain Fate.
