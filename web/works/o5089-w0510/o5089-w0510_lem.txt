Petrarch and Laura.

a epigrammatic tale.

dan Petrarch of old, it have often be say,
 by some cardinal urge, his fair Laura to wed,
 with a offer of fortune (and well-timed it be,
 for poet have seldom much rend from parnass)
 cry, my lord you will excuse i, but i have a reason
 why even this offer become out of season;
 i have a new book of sonnet just ripe for the press,
 upon the same plan as the last, you may guess;
 i have there, all along, make my Laura a goddess,
 and Venus, to please i, have lend she the boddice;
 while Hebe, Minerva, and twenty to boot,
 with gift all celestial have trick i her out. 
now marriage, my lord, the whole charm will destroy,
 and hurl her divinity quite from the sky,
 to my cost i shall find she no more than a woman,
 and my sonnet, alas! will gain credit with no man.
