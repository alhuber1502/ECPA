a address of the statue at STOWE, to lord Cobham, on his return to his garden.

from every muse and every art thy own,
thy bower our theatre, thy mind our throne!
hail! to thy virtue manumise from state;
hail! to thy leisure to be wise great.

fetter by duty and to form enslave,
how timely have thy year a remnant save!
to taste that freedom which thy sword maintain,
and lead in letter ease, a life unpain:
so Scipio (Carthage fall) resign his plume,
and smile at the forgetfulness of Rome.
o great bless! who evening sweet shine,
and, in unclouded slowness, calm decline!
while free reflection with revert eye,
wane from hot noontide and a trouble sky,
divide life well: the large part, long know
thy country claim; the last and best thy own.

here while detach, thy self-supported soul
resume dominion and escape control;
move with a grandeur, monarch wish in vain,
above all fear, storm, danger, hope or pain;
a glance sometime from thy safe summit show,
and see the dusty world look dim below:
through the dark throng discern huge slave of pride
shoulder unheeded happiness aside;
thwart and push and labour into name,
and dignify with all the dirt of fame;
then with a smile superior, turn away,
and lop the exuberance of some straggle spray;
wind through thy maze to serene delight,
and from the burst bubble shade thy sight.

yet where thou shine, like heaven behind a cloud,
move like light, all pierce, though not loud;
the muse shall find thou in thy bless retreat,
and breathe this honest wish at cobham foot:
fresh as thy lake, may all thy pleasure flow!
and breezy like thy grove, thy passion blow!
wide as thy fancy, be thy spread praise!
and long and lovely as thy walk, thy day!
