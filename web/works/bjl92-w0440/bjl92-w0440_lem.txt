to my aunty. 

my ever dear and worthy aunty,
 who never of wit nor lear be vaunty;
 yet often can, like honest grandam,
 unraveling dream; and while, at random,
 do truth in mystic term declare,
 which make we aft with wonder stare. 

last night, when Morpheus soft hurl
 his silken sceptre over the world,
 some anxious care within my breast
 be silent consign to rest;
 yet do in sleep their power retain,
 as show the vision of my brain. 

my work i think appear in print,
 and be to different corner send,
 whare patron kind, but scant of skill,
 have sign my superscription bill. 
voratious critic by the way,
 like eagle watch for their prey,
 soon catch the verse with aspect sour,
 and do ilk feeble thought devour;
 nor do its humble, helpless state,
 one fraction of their rage abate. 

Tom touchy, one of high pretence
 to taste and learning, wit and sense,
 be at the board the foremost man,
 its imperfection all to scan. 
soon as the line he seem to doubt,
 the mean critic scratch it out;
 still to be name on touchy side,
 be both their interest and their pride. 

will hasty, in a unco rage,
 revise the volume page by page;
 but aft be deem a stupid ass,
 for censure what alone may pass. 

jack timorous glad will have speak,
 but quiver lip his sentence break;
 so much he fear a brother scorn,
 the whole escape his claw untorn. 

James easy calm my throb heart,
 and whisper tell each man apart,
 that he the volume much esteem;
 its little fault he nothing deem:
 and if his vote they will receive,
 it may through countless age live. 

while i poor James speech admire,
 Tom touchy at the sound be fire:
 and ah! it grieve i much to find,
 he prove he senseless, deaf, and blind:
 then quick as thought, ere i can tell he,
 ilk critic club be up to fell he;
 and as he, helpless, meet the stroke,
 i, start, tremble, since awake. 

now aunty, see this sad narration,
 which fill my breast with fair vexation
 and if you can some comfort gie i,
 make no delay, but send it to i:
 for i be command by Apollo,
 your sage advice in this to follow.
