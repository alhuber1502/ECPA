TIME.

TIME may ambition's nest destroy,
 Though on a rock 'tis perch'd so high,
 May find dull av'rice in his cave,
 And drag to light the sordid slave;
 But from affection's temper'd chain
 To free the heart he strives in vain. 

The sculptur'd urn, the marble bust,
 By time are crumbled with the dust;
 But tender thoughts the muse has twin'd
 For love, for friendship's brow design'd,
 Shall still endure, shall still delight,
 Till time is lost in endless night.
