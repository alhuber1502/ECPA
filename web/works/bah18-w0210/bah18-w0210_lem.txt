time.

time may ambition nest destroy,
 though on a rock it be perch so high,
 may find dull avarice in his cave,
 and drag to light the sordid slave;
 but from affection tempere chain
 to free the heart he strive in vain. 

the sculpture urn, the marble bust,
 by time be crumble with the dust;
 but tender thought the muse have twine
 for love, for friendship brow design,
 shall still endure, shall still delight,
 till time be lose in endless night.
