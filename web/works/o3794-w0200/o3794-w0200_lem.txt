on the burn of lord mansfield library, together with his mss. by the mob, in the month of June, 1780. 

1. 

so then â€” the Vandals of our isle,
 swear foe to sense and law,
 have burn to dust a noble pile
 than ever roman saw! 

2. 

and Murray sigh over pope and swift,
 and many a treasure more,
 the well-judged purchase and the gift
 that grace his letter store. 

3. 

their page mangle, burn and tear,
 the loss be his alone,
 but age yet to come shall mourn
 the burn of his own.
