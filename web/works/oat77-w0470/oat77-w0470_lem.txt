the ignorant.

a ignorant i be,
and glory in the name '
i wot not what of yore
rash furioso do,
nor what the dream sage say:
i can run a list of old Rome triumph over.
it be knowledge first to ruin lead we on;
for with this mortal itch possess
the happy pair transgress,
needs must they know, they know and be undo! 
and to this hour our misery sole relief
consist in ignorance of our grief! 
then plod mortal cease
to boast your dear-bought faculty;
for since with knowledge sorrow must increase,
let such as on those term can science prize,
improve in science; but for i,
so i may ignorant and happy be,
i will never repine or look with envious eye,
on the unhappy learnt, and miserable wise.
