On Celia's Picture, drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller. 

WITH such a sapient Eye, and heav'nly Mind,
 MINERVA taught her Arts to human Kind;
 With such attractive Charms, and graceful Air,
 VENUS was judg'd the Queen of all the Fair:
 Such Sense and Beauty to the Painter shone,
 He drew Two Goddesses, to finish One.
