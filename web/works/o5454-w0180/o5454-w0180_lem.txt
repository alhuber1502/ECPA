song xviii.

against scoff and call name.

i 

our tongue be make to bless the lord,
 and not speak ill of man;
 when other give a rail word,
 we must not rail again. 

ii.

cross word and angry name require
 to be chastise at school;
 and he be in danger of hell-fire
 that call his brother fool. 

iii.

but lip that dare be so profane,
 to mock and jeer and scoff
 at holy thing or holy man,
 the lord shall cut they off. 

iv.

when child in heir wanton play
 serve old Elisha so;
 and bid the prophet go his way,
 "go up, thou bald-head, go." 

v. 

god quick stop their wicked breath,
 and send two rage bear,
 that tear they limb from limb to death,
 with blood and groan and tear. 

vi.

great god, how terrible be thou
 to sinner ever so young! 
grant i thy grace, and teach i how
 to tame and rule my tongue.
