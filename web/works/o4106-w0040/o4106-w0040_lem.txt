song.

my day have be so wondrous free,
 the little bird that fly
 with careless ease from tree to tree,
 be but as bless as i. 

ask glide water, if a tear
 of i increase their stream? 
or ask the fly gale, if ever
 i lend one sigh to they? 

but now my former day retire,
 and i be by beauty catch,
 the tender chain of sweet desire
 be fix upon my thought. 

you nightingale, you twist pine! 
you swain that haunt the grove! 
you gentle echo, breezy wind! 
you close retreat of love! 

with all of nature, all of art,
 assist the dear design;
 o teach a young, unpractised heart,
 to make my Nancy mine. 

the very thought of change i hate,
 as much as of despair;
 nor ever covet to be great,
 unless it be for she. 

it be true, the passion in my mind
 be mix with soft distress;
 yet while the fair i love be kind,
 i can wish it less.
