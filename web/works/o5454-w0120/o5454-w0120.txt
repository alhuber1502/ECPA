SONG XII.

The Advantages of early Religion.

I.

HAPPY the Child whose tender Years
 Receive Instructions well:
 Who hates the Sinner's Path, and fears
 The Road that leads to Hell. 

II.

When we devote our Youth to GOD,
 'Tis pleasing in his Eyes;
 A Flow'r, when offer'd in the Bud,
 Is no vain Sacrifice. 

III.

'Tis easier Work if we begin
 To fear the LORD betimes;
 While Sinners that grow old in Sin
 Are harden'd in their Crimes,

IV.

'Twill save us from a thousand Snares,
 To mind Religion young;
 Grace will preserve our following Years,
 And make our Virtue strong. 

V.

To thee, Almighty GOD, to thee,
 Our Childhood we resign;
 'Twill please us to look back and see
 That our whole Lives were thine. 

VI.

Let the sweet Work of Pray'r and Praise
 Employ my youngest Breath;
 Thus I'm prepar'd for longer Days,
 Or fit for early Death.
