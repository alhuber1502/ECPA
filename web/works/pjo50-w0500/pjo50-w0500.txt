Written at her Apartment in Windsor-Castle. 

I.

Whilst You, dear Maid, to soft alarms
 Resign the genial hour,
 Forsaking all for Henry's charms,
 Your own, and Ours no more:

II.

I lean my philosophic head
 On table cold as clay,
 And read — good Gods, how I do read! 
My very soul away. 

III.

My Lady hears away her rage
 In tragedy so deep:
 Fringes no more her soul engage —
 Ev'n John has leave to sleep. 

IV.

Thus all forgetting, or forgot,
 While You are from our view,
 To knot and read, and read and knot,
 Is all we have to do.
