write at her apartment in windsor-castle. 

i 

while you, dear maid, to soft alarm
 resign the genial hour,
 forsake all for Henry charm,
 your own, and we no more:

ii.

i lean my philosophic head
 on table cold as clay,
 and read — good god, how i do read! 
my very soul away. 

iii.

my lady hear away her rage
 in tragedy so deep:
 fringe not more her soul engage —
 even John have leave to sleep. 

iv.

thus all forget, or forget,
 while you be from our view,
 to knot and read, and read and knot,
 be all we have to do.
