the choice.

grant i indulgent heaven a rural seat,
rather contemptible than great. 
where, though i taste life sweet, still i may be
athirst for immortality. 
i will have business, but exempt from strife;
a private, but a active life.
a conscience bold and punctual to his charge;
my stock of health or patience large.
some book i will have, and some acquaintance too,
but very good, and very few. 
then (if one mortal two such grant may crave)
from silent life i will steal into my grave.
