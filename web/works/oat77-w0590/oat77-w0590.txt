The Choice.

GRant me indulgent Heav'n a rurall Seat,
Rather Contemptible than Great. 
Where, though I Tast Life's Sweets, still I may be
Athirst for Immortalitie. 
I wou'd have Business, but exempt from Strife;
A Private, but an Active Life.
A Conscience bold and punctuall to his Charge;
My Stock of Health or Patience Large.
Some Books I'd have, and some Acquaintance too,
But very Good, and very Few. 
Then (if one Mortall Two such Grants may Crave)
From Silent Life I'd Steal into my Grave.
