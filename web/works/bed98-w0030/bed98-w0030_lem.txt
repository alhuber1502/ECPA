the laurel.

that fortune fickle, beauty frail,
have be the theme of many a tale,
and solemn bard, with soar eye,
have trace our passage to the sky.
that earthly honour quick pass,
that life be a dream, and flesh be grass,
be truth the preacher will impart,
in melt lesson to the heart,
and, if on beauty, wealth, or fame,
you dare to build a haughty claim,
the moralist again will try,
to wean your heart from vanity.
attend, you beauty of a day,
for you i dress my moral lay,
you, who to wealth or fame aspire,
for you i tune my will lyre.

there live a maid, Eliza name,
who be for nothing very fame,
with beauty she be never bless,
and this her sex can well attest,
to fortune she as little owe,
a circumstance well understand,
all her pretension, all her aim,
be to deserve a honest name;
with modesty to live retire,
and leave the gay to be admire,
a shepherd, skill in flattery lore,
however, send some verse to she,
he praise she for ideal grace,
and wrong he be in many place,
though wrong, she know he mean no evil,
and think he be exceed civil,
she tell he, as in duty bind,
she wish he be with laurel crown;
a nymph there be of lovely mien,
who live at that time on the green,
no fit subject for his muse,
the poet sure can ever choose;
and ready for his simile,
the earth and sky before he lie;
to he the garden yield its pride,
the mine its treasure can hide,
and little brook, and mighty sea,
he pilfer with the great ease,
oh! for the magic of his art,
to sooth the weakness of the heart;
and on the sunbeam of a eye,
to rise to immortality;
my humble muse, alone must tell,
i know the nymph and love she well,
much merit she may just claim,
and Hannah be the fair one name;
as cheerful they pass the day,
together oft these nymph will stray,
and once a laurel they espy,
which raise its head with conscious pride;
the tree a little garden grace,
and by a lowly cot be place,
they pity that apollo care,
shall waste its classic honour there,
the thought to flatter Colin lead,
how much its leaf will grace his head,
equal please with the intent,
they instant to the cottage go,
the dame, for who the laurel grow,
no Daphne or Apollo know,
the lady speak she very fair,
tell she they see a laurel there,
if she can such a favour grant,
some of it be leave they soon shall want;
the dame reply, they be too good,
on such a trifle to have stand,
but near the road, and low the wall,
they may, for she, have take they all;
it be a tree she have no good in,
except indeed to mend a pudding,
and then in winter it be green,
a time one value such a thing,
but they be welcome to a part,
of her tree leaf, with all her heart.
with skilful hand, fair Hannah weave,
apollo consecrate leaf,
nor ever before or since be see,
so gay a garland on that green,
its wave circle gay play,
to crown the favour poet head.
a sylph, who tread the rural scene,
in haste convey it over the green;
the yield door soon open fly,
and full she shine on colin view;
he hail she as a nymph divine,
she he a favourite of the nine,
the prize of wit she then display,
wish to see it on his head.
his head — his dinner scarce begin,
on honour — less than eat run,
it be a truth the shepherd own,
he think of salad more than crown:
but such a slight soon to repair,
he view it with attentive care,
and on its leaf he find a note,
which simple thus the lady write.

'let gold and gem, a ponderous weight,
'surround the care-worn brow of state,
'and may the mournful yew be spread,
'over the cold ash of the dead.
'while the gay rose and myrtle twine,
'the happy lover temple bind.
'but may the head of sad despair,
'a wreathe of droop willow wear.
'while still at friendship sacred shrine,
'the vine shall round the elm entwine.
'but when a poet we have find,
'with laurel shall the bard be crown.'

it be with surprise the damsel learn,
the shepherd have the crown return.
he say Eliza ought to wear it,
nor will he even pretend to share it.
well please she keep the gild crown,
by flattery more beauteous grow.
a vision now i introduce,
be aught deny the poet use?
but lady, that it need not fright,
it be no imp that shun the light,
or haunt the mansion of the dead,
from they it be for ever flee,
its being rise when earth begin,
and end but with the race of man;
its silent path be swift tread,
and many victim strew its road,
its hand a scythe and hourglass bear,
to mark its progress and its power,
it touch the crown, which own its stroke,
while thus to reason ear it speak. —
'a boundless conqueror be i,
'nor boast of partial victory;
'i take this trifle toy from you,
'and mighty empire i subdue.
her fade crown Eliza view,
and thus the moral thought pursue —
fade trifle, pass jest,
mimic pageant of a day,
no more for laurel we will contest,
prize which time shall bear away.
