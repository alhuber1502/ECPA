the rival nymph.

a tale.

CLarissa bless with every grace,
 a shape divine, and charm face,
 have triumph long over many a Swain,
 and oft be woo, but woo in vain;
 not so Amanda, bloom youth,
 soft innocence, and artless truth,
 be all the beauty she can boast,
 not form by nature for a toast;
 yet some there be, who in her mind
 a thousand nameless charm can find:
 she love not visit, park, or play,
 but mope, and read her time away;
 insensible to a degree,
 her heart be all her own, and free;
 yet oft of love soft please pain,
 the nymph will write in melt strain. 
the lambent flame that warm her breast,
 each tender flow line confess;
 moneses, who enchant form
 be one continue endless charm:
 to who indulgent heaven have join,
 all that can beautify a mind;
 have often own bright beauty power,
 have sigh and love â€” for half a hour. 
but yet the lovely youth confess,
 whoever can wound his destine breast,
 her charm must over time prevail,
 her wit must please when beauty fail;
 yet since he can not hope to find,
 one bless with all those charm of mind;
 he think Clarissa worth his care,
 and all the hour he have to spare;
 soft vow, and tender speak eye,
 plead look, and melt sigh;
 make the believe maid approve
 his false, but well dissemble love. 
but while Clarissa charm he own,
 he with a secret passion burn. 
Amanda find the way to win
 his heart, and let her image in;
 his pain the lovely youth conceal,
 all but what his eye reveal:
 his eye, that all his passion tell,
 and speak the love he feel so well. 

Amanda hear the youth complain,
 she hear and feel a equal flame;
 but still with native shyness arm,
 she shun the lovely Swain she charm;
 his look, his sigh, his action move,
 and in soft language plead for love. 

Clarissa still exult, and cry,
 he be yet a victim to my eye;
 he neither will, nor can be free;
 i he still love, and only i:
 ah! cease to claim my charm prize;
 Amanda, to the fair reply,
 can i, Clarissa, can i boast,
 the heart that to thy charm be lose,
 with joy i will they all resign,
 to keep my love moneses mine. 

in vain the nymph declare her flame,
 Clarissa still assert her claim;
 and until the love moneses own,
 the conquer maid for who he burn;
 until he will the happy fair unfold,
 the sequel must remain untold.
