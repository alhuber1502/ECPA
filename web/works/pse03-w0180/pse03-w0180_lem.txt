love.

love, like original sin, in all do dwell,
 fool sigh in private, and the witty tell;
 boast they be fond passion in repeat rhyme,
 that other reign mischief of the time:
 the learnt ashamed to own their amorous pain,
 vent the warm rapture in a pious strain,
 sigh, languish, die, (though for a mortal fair,)
 in lay divine, like Quarles and Arwaker.
