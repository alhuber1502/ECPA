ae night in dark December.

ae night in dark December, when wintery blast blow high,
 poor Jenny sit she in the nook and wish her jockey by:
 long time thou have promise i to come from yonder busy town,
 and gin you do haste i fear the wrinkle will come soon;
 for i have fret myself with care, thy face i can see,
 and when ilk lass be with her lad i sigh and wish for thou. 

what signify a mint of gear when we be both grow old,
 and when December in the heart keep turn all thing cauld? 
thou will grow so cross, and i so stiff, my will i will bend,
 for time aye harden little fault until they can mend:
 man never will give up their way, and i will think i the best,
 and as so long we have court be will be the younker jest. 

i will have thou in a April morn when bird begin to sing,
 like they to choose thyself a mate, and hail the cheerful spring;
 o haste to i while over thy way she strew the fair flower,
 nor suffer these poor eye again to add to April shower;
 i will aye be gay, and ever smile, gin thou will make haste to i,
 if not, i will quick change my mind, and think no more of thou!
