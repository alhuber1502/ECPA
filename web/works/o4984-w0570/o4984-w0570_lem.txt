true beauty.

by dr. Fordyce.

the diamond and the ruby blaze
 dispute the palm with beauty queen:
 not beauty queen command such praise,
 devoid of virtue if she be see. 

but the soft tear in pity eye
 outshine the diamond bright beam;
 but the sweet blush of modesty
 more beauteous than the ruby seem.
