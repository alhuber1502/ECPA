TRUE BEAUTY.

BY DR. FORDYCE.

THE diamond's and the ruby's blaze
 Disputes the palm with Beauty's queen:
 Not Beauty's queen commands such praise,
 Devoid of virtue if she's seen. 

But the soft tear in Pity's eye
 Outshines the diamond's brightest beams;
 But the sweet blush of Modesty
 More beauteous than the ruby seems.
