A HYMN FOR NEW YEAR'S DAY.

AGAIN time's ever fleeting hand
Points to the finish'd year;
It's moments with past ages stand,
Nor more for me appear.

Say has improvement mark'd your flight,
Seasons in mercy given?
Does the recording angel write
His testimony, heaven?

For tho' from me for ever flown,
Unchang'd you awful mount;
And angels smile, or fiends you frown
Upon my last account.

Then as the opening dawn I hail,
Of time to me renew'd;
Be what I do and where I fail,
Impartially review'd.

And while th' important moments pass,
And time again revolves;
Spirit of power and heavenly grace,
Assist my weak resolves.

From each imperfect virtuous part,
Then purer good shall spring;
From errors past, a contrite heart,
Sainted repentance bring.
