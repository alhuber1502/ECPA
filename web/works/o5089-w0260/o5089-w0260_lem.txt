prologue to the Englishman at Bordeaux.

perform since the conclusion of the peace, with universal applause, at Paris.

too long by some fatality mislead,
 from pride result, or from folly breed;
 each clime to all the virtue lay a claim,
 and soar, self-flattered, to the top of fame;
 confine each merit to itself alone,
 or think no other equal to its own:
 even the pale russian shiver as he lie,
 beneath the horror of his bitter sky,
 while the loud tempest rattle over his head,
 or burst all dreadful on his totter shed,
 hug a soft something close to his soul,
 that soothe the cut sharpness of the pole,
 elate his bosom with a conscious pride,
 and smile contempt on all the world beside. 

it be you, o France, the early to unbind
 this more than Gordian manacle of mind! 
tonight we bid your justice may be show
 to foreign virtue equal with your own;
 think, noble think, when nature first be bear,
 and fair creation kindle into morn,
 the world be but one family, one band,
 which glow all grateful to the heavenly hand;
 through every breast a social impulse run,
 link beast to beast, and fasten man to man,
 and the sole difference which he hear, or have,
 dwell in the simple phrase, "good or bad."
then scorn to give such partial feeling birth,
 as claim but one poor competence of earth;
 be more than french; on every country call,
 and rise, exalt, citizen of all.
