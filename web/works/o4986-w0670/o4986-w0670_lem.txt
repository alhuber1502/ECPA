the vanity of wealth:

a ode.

by the same.

no more thus brood over yond heap,
 with avarice painful vigil keep,
 still unenjoyed the present store,
 still endless sigh be breathe for more. 
o quit the shadow, catch the prize,
 which not all india treasure buy! 
to purchase heaven have gold the power? 
can gold remove the mortal hour? 
in life can love be buy with gold? 
be friendship pleasure to be sell? 
no â€” all that be worth a wish, a thought,
 fair virtue give, unbribed, unbought. 
cease then on trash thy hope to bind,
 let noble view engage thy mind. 

with science tread the wondrous way,
 or learn the muse moral lie;
 in social hour indulge thy soul,
 where mirth and temperance mix the bowl;
 to virtuous love resign thy breast,
 and be by blessing beauty bless. 

thus taste the feast by nature spread,
 ere youth, and all its joy be flee;
 come, taste with i the balm of life,
 secure from pomp, and wealth, and strife. 
i boast, whatever for man be mean,
 in health, and Stella, and content;
 and scorn! oh! let that scorn be thy! 
mere thing of clay, that dig the mine.
