fairy revels,

a song.

hark, the raven flap his wing,
 the owlet leave her oaken bower,
 now we dance in airy ring,
 on mossy bank at evening hour:
 and light beat the dewy ground
 with our tiny foot around. 

vapour dark, or sprite impure,
 our fairy revel never invade,
 in the hawthorn break secure
 the glowworm light we through the shade. 
we light beat the dewy ground
 with our tiny foot around.
