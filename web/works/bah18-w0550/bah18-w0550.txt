FAIRY REVELS,

A SONG.

HARK, the raven flaps his wings,
 The owlet leaves her oaken bower,
 Now we dance in airy ring,
 On mossy banks at ev'ning hour:
 And lightly beat the dewy ground
 With our tiny feet around. 

Vapours dark, or sprites impure,
 Our fairy revels ne'er invade,
 In the hawthorn brake secure
 The glow-worm lights us thro' the shade. 
We lightly beat the dewy ground
 With our tiny feet around.
