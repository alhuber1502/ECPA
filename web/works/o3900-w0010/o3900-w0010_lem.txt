eupolis hymn to the creator.

author of be, source of light,
 with unfading beauty bright,
 fullness, goodness, roll round
 thy own fair orb without a bind:
 whether thou thy supplicant call
 truth, or good, or one, or all,
 ei or iao; thou we hail
 essence that can never fail,
 grecian or barbaric name,
 thy steadfast be still the same. 

thou, when morning greet the sky
 with rosy cheek and humid eye;
 thou, when sweet-declining day
 sink in purple wave away;
 thou will i sing, o parent Jove
 and teach the world to praise and love. 

yonder azure vault on high,
 yonder blue, low, liquid sky,
 earth on its firm basis place,
 and with circle wave embrace,
 all, create power confess,
 all their mighty maker bless. 
thou shake all nature with thy nod,
 sea, earth and air confess the god:
 yet do thy powerful hand sustain
 both earth and heaven, both firm and main. 

scarce can our dare thought arise
 to thy pavilion in the sky;
 nor can Plato self declare
 the bliss, the joy, the rapture there. 
barren above thou do not reign,
 but circle with a glorious train,
 the son of god, the son of light,
 ever joy in thy sight:
 (for thou their silver harp be string,)
 ever beauteous, ever young,
 angelic form their voice raise,
 and through heaven arch resound thy praise. 

the feather soul that swim the air,
 and bathe in liquid ether there,
 the lark, precentor of their choir
 lead they high still and high,
 listen and learn; the angelic note
 repeat in their warble throat:
 and ere to soft repose they go,
 teach they to their lord below:
 on the green turf, their mossy nest,
 the evening anthem swell their breast. 
thus like thy golden chain from high,
 thy praise unite the earth and sky. 

source of light, thou bid the sun
 on his burn axle run;
 the star like dust around he fly,
 and show the area of the sky. 
he drive so swift his race above,
 mortal can perceive he move:
 so smoothe his course, oblique or strait,
 Olympus shake not with his weight. 
as the queen of solemn night
 fill at his vase her orb of light,
 impart lustre; thus we see,
 the solar virtue shine by thou. 

eiresione we will no more,
 imaginary power, adore;
 since oil, and wool, and cheere wine,
 and life-sustaining bread be thy. 

thy herbage, o great Pan, sustain
 the flock that graze our attic plain;
 the olive, with fresh verdure crown,
 rise pregnant from the ground;
 at thy command it shoot and spring,
 and a thousand blessing bring. 
Minerva, only be thy mind,
 wisdom, and bounty to mankind. 
the fragrant thyme, the bloomy rose,
 herb and flower and shrub that grow
 on thessalian tempe plain,
 or where the rich sabean reign,
 that treat the taste or smell or sight,
 for food, for medicine or delight;
 plant by thy parent care,
 spring and smile and flourish there. 

o you nurse of soft dream,
 Reedy brook and wind stream,
 or murmur over the pebble sheen,
 or slide through the meadow green,
 or where through mat sedge you creep,
 travel to your parent deep:
 sound his praise, by who you rise,
 that sea, which neither ebb nor flow. 

o you immortal wood and groves,
 which the enamour student love;
 beneath who venerable shade,
 for thought and friendly converse make,
 fame hecadem, old hero, lie,
 who shrine be shade from the sky,
 and through the gloom of silent night
 project from far its tremble light;
 you, who root descend as low,
 as high in air your branch grow;
 your leafy arm to heaven extend,
 bend your head, in homage bend:
 Cedars and pine that wave above,
 and the oak belove of Jove. 

omen, monster, prodigy,
 or nothing be, or Jove from thou! 
whether various nature play,
 or re-inversed thy will obey,
 and to rebel man declare
 famine, plague or wasteful war. 
laugh, you profane, who dare despise
 the threaten vengeance of the sky,
 while the pious, on his guard,
 undismayed be still prepare:
 life or death, his mind be at rest,
 since what thou send must needs be best. 

no evil can from thou proceed:
 it be only suffer, not decree. 
darkness be not from the sun,
 nor mount the shade till he be go:
 then do night obscene arise
 from Erebus, and fill the sky,
 fantastic form the air invade,
 daughter of nothing and of shade. 

can we forget thy guardian care,
 slow to punish, prone to spare! 
thou brake the haughty persian pride,
 that dare old ocean power deride;
 their shipwreck strew the eubean wave,
 at Marathon they find a grave. 
o you bless greek who there expire,
 for Greece with pious ardor fire,
 what shrine or altar shall we raise
 to secure your endless praise? 
or need we monument supply,
 to rescue what can never die! 

and yet a great hero far
 (unless great Socrates can err)
 shall rise to bless some future day,
 and teach to live, and teach to pray. 
come, unknown instructor, come! 
our leap heart shall make thou room;
 thou with Jove our vow shall share,
 of Jove and thou we be the care. 

o father king, who heavenly face
 shine serene on all thy race,
 we thy magnificence adore,
 and thy wellknown aid implore:
 nor vain for thy help we call;
 nor can we want: for thou be all!
