the invocation.

with some auspicious aid you power above,
 help to support the weight of slight love. 
i ask not rage to curse the dare man;
 that by instinctive power all woman can,
 but keep i mild as when love first begin. 
it be the malignancy of low desire,
 that with neglect turn to revengeful fire:
 but my great passion, like Ã¦thereal flame,
 without supply can ever burn the same;
 love glow in every atom of my frame. 
sparkle in every thought, flame at my heart,
 like the extensive soul it do exert;
 it be all in all, and all in every part. 
from his cold breast no languid warmth i want,
 his fire when at their height to i be faint,
 yet my hard fate force this soft complaint. 
that so much truth be unregarded lose,
 and we have least when we deserve it most. 
oh! be i fickle as the restless wind,
 or as the wise part of womankind:
 then for the charmer i will not long mourn,
 but treat his negligence with equal scorn. 
he shall no more my slight favour wear,
 but from the sigh crowd that deaf my ear,
 i will choose some kind youth and fix they there. 
but oh! my tender soul too weak do prove,
 either to change or bear the force of love;
 too sure it be doom by my relentless fate
 that i must love and sink beneath the weight.
