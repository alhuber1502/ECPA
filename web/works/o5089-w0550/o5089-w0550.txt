EPITAPH ON CLAUDIUS PHILLIPS.

BY THE SAME.

PHILLIPS! whose touch harmonious could remove
 The pangs of guiltless power or hapless love,
 Rest here oppress'd by poverty no more,
 Here find that calm thou gav'st so oft before:
 Rest undisturb'd within this humble shrine,
 Till angels wake thee with a note like thine.
