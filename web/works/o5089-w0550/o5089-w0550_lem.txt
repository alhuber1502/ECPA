epitaph on Claudius Phillips.

by the same.

Phillips! who touch harmonious can remove
 the pang of guiltless power or hapless love,
 rest here oppress by poverty no more,
 here find that calm thou give so oft before:
 rest undisturbed within this humble shrine,
 till angel wake thou with a note like thy.
