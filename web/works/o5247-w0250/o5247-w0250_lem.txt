verse write extempore on a gentleman play on the flute.

i 

oh! cease thy too harmonious strain,
 nor thus my ravish soul surprise:
 what new idea, please pain,
 do by the sweet enchantment rise? 

ii.

lulled by the dear bewitch sound,
 each jar passion charm to rest;
 yet my soul feel a please wound,
 and sweet disorder fill my breast. 

iii.

forbear to show thy heavenly art,
 nor aim a conquest over my mind;
 by music soften to the dart,
 love may a easy entrance find.
