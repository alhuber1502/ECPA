by the same. 

new-year's-day, 1733. 

see, the bright sun renew his annual course,
 each beam re-tinge, and revive its force,
 by year uninjured; so may thou remain,
 not time from thou, but thou from time may gain:
 o may the fate thy vital thread prolong,
 and make thy life immortal, as thy song! 

less lustre wait the god, when he refine
 the ripen metal in Peruvian mine;
 brighten the crystal with transparent day,
 or point the diamond with its sparkle ray;
 than when, delight, he thy soul inspire,
 inform thy judgement, and thy fancy fire;
 assist thou strike out some bold design,
 and breathe immortal honour on each line:
 in common as his ray on all descend,
 so you the great delight, the poor befriend:
 as heat productive his bright beam bestow,
 so, warm with life, your powerful number flow:
 as he from cloud burst forth divine bright,
 so envy set you in a fair light:
 yet, though thus far similitude we see,
 one thing disturb the wondrous harmony;
 with fade light the winter sun appear,
 while you shine bright in decline of year.
