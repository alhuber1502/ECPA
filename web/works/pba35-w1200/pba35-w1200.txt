To Mrs. Barber. 

By the Same. 

New-Year's-Day, 1733.

See, the bright Sun renews his annual Course,
 Each Beam re-tinges, and revives its Force,
 By Years uninjur'd; so may'st thou remain,
 Not Time from thee, but thou from Time may'st gain:
 O might the Fates thy vital Thread prolong,
 And make thy Life immortal, as thy Song! 

Less Lustre waits the God, when he refines
 The rip'ning Metal in Peruvian Mines;
 Brightens the Crystal with transparent Day,
 Or points the Di'mond with its sparkling Ray;
 Than when, delighted, he thy Soul inspires,
 Informs thy Judgment, and thy Fancy fires;
 Assists thee striking out some bold Design,
 And breathes immortal Honours on each Line:
 In common as His Rays on all descend,
 So You the Great delight, the Poor befriend:
 As Heat productive His bright Beams bestow,
 So, warm with Life, your pow'rful Numbers flow:
 As He from Clouds bursts forth divinely bright,
 So Envy sets You in a fairer Light:
 Yet, tho' thus far Similitude we see,
 One Thing disturbs the wond'rous Harmony;
 With faded Light the Winter Sun appears,
 Whilst You shine brighter in Decline of Years.
