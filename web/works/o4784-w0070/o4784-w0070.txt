There's No To-Morrow,

A FABLE imitated from Sir Roger L'Estrange. 

TWO long had Lov'd, and now the Nymph desir'd,
 The Cloak of Wedlock, as the Case requir'd;
 Urg'd that, the Day he wrought her to this Sorrow,
 He Vow'd, that he wou'd marry her To-Morrow. 
Agen he Swears, to shun the present Storm,
 That he, To-Morrow, will that Vow perform. 
The Morrows in their due Successions came;
 Impatient still on Each, the pregnant Dame
 Urg'd him to keep his Word, and still he swore the same. 
When tir'd at length, and meaning no Redress,
 But yet the Lye not caring to confess,
 He for his Oath this Salvo chose to borrow,
 That he was Free, since there was no To-Morrow;
 For when it comes in Place to be employ'd,
 'Tis then To-Day; To-Morrow's ne'er enjoy'd. 
The Tale's a Jest, the Moral is a Truth;
 To-Morrow and To-Morrow, cheat our Youth:
 In riper Age, To-Morrow still we cry,
 Not thinking, that the present Day we Dye;
 Unpractis'd all the Good we had Design'd;
 There's No To-Morrow to a Willing Mind.
