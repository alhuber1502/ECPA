to W. p. esq. Avondale.

we wish for thou, dear friend! for summer eve
 upon thy lovely landscape never cast
 look of more linger sweetness than the last. 
the slant sun, reluctant to bereave
 thy wood of beauty, fond seem to leave
 smile of the soft light, that slow pass
 in bright succession over each charm thou have
 thyself so oft admire. and we may grieve
 thy eye of taste shall ever wander hence
 over scene less lovely than thy own; but here
 thou will return, and feel thy home more dear;
 more dear the muses gentle influence,
 when on the busy world, with wisdom smile,
 and heart uninjured, thou have gaze awhile.
