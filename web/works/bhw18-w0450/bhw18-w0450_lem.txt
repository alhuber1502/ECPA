line write on the pillar erect to the memory of mr. Barlow,

minister of the unite state at Paris, who die at NAROWITCH in Poland, on his return from Wilna, DEC.  26, 1812. 

where over the polish desert trackless way
 relentless winter rule with savage sway, —
 where the shrill polar wind, as wild they blow,
 seem to repeat some plaint of mortal woe, —
 far over the cheerless waste, the traveller eye
 shall this recording pillar long descry,
 and give the sod a tear where Barlow lie —
 he who be simple great and noble wise. 
here, lead by patriot zeal, he meet his doom,
 and find, amid the freeze waste, a tomb;
 far from his native soil the patriot fall,
 far from that western world he sing so well! 
nor she, so long belove! nor she be nigh,
 to catch the die look, the part sigh! 
she who, the hopeless anguish to beguile,
 in fond memorial rear the funeral pile! 
who widow bosom on columbia shore
 shall mourn the moment that return no more;
 while, bend over the broad atlantic wave,
 sad fancy hover on the distant grave.
