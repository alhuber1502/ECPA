in the dream of the moment.

in the dream of the moment i call for the bowl,
 and fond imagine each grief will depart;
 but i find that a bumper can reach the pure soul,
 nor wine clear the sorrow that weigh down the heart. 

though fancy may sparkle as shine the gay glass,
 and wit, like air-bubble, keep rise the while,
 or mirth and good humour shake hand as they pass,
 and fond recollection come back with a smile;

yet, right if i ween, for the joy that be past
 i see a soft tear steal into her eye; —
 we know, gentle maid, that such hour can last,
 though hold fast by friendship and brighten by joy. 

ah! well do i know, for, since reason young dawn
 first hold her light torch over this silver-grown head,
 i have mark the sweet floweret adorn the lawn,
 fade under my eye, and then mix with the dead. 

the light leaf of summer that fan we today,
 and shake their green head as we frolic around,
 one breath of cold winter shall waft they away,
 and a new wave race the next season be find. 

since thus it must be — since our summer must fade,
 and autumn and winter succeed in their turn,
 let we make much of life, and enjoy her green shade,
 nor long for lose pleasure continue to mourn.
