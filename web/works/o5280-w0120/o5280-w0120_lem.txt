elegiac ballad.

to HENRY m'kenzie ESQ.

dim be the beamy star of night,
 the moon have veil her temperate light;
 the gale be rude, the gale be high,
 and cheerless show the lower sky;
 all house within a age yew,
 who bough be dank with midnight dew,
 night lonely bird, with sadden strain,
 awake the echo of the plain;
 while still the sweet responsive maid,
 from forth her dark, unnoticed shade,
 repeat slow the doleful tale,
 and faint give it to the gale. 
it be then the churchyard hollow sod
 with frantic step poor Nancy tread;
 she seek the spot where Henry sleep,
 and over his grave in anguish weep. 
fond friendship hand have plant there
 such flowret wild as woodland bear;
 the cowslip sweet, the violet blue,
 there drink soft pity fall dew;
 the panzy pale, the wild rose red,
 be cluster round her Henry head;
 and, wave over the thron-bound grave,
 the woodbine there its fragrance give. 
beside the spot a willow grow,
 of love, like she, the emblem true;
 from that one votive branch she break,
 and thus the lovely mourner speak:
 "who can the friendly charm impart
 to heal poor Nancy break heart? 
on this green grave she rest her head,
 to weep her friend, her true-love dead. 
then from the tomb, dear youth, return,
 nor long let thy Nancy mourn;
 in pity quit the cheerless grave,
 and from despair thy Nancy save. 
he come, he come; i see he now
 on yonder mountain spiry brow;
 at Nancy call i know he will come,
 to soothe her grief, and lead she home. 
ah, i! he be go; he shun these arm. 
can Henry scorn his Nancy charm? 
ah, no! ah, no! my Henry dead. 
then be this grave my bridal bed." 
all over the grave her form she throw,
 her tress sleep in the dew;
 on heaven she fix her azure eye,
 she sigh, she sink, no more to rise. 
you favour few, who know to love,
 who sorrow sacred pleasure prove;
 to where these lover sleep repair,
 and pity self shall meet you there.
