to lady Charlemont, in return for her present of flower

march, 1808. 

yes, though the sullen east-wind storm,
 and sunless sky the spring deform,
 the lovely nina graceful hand
 can, like a fairy lily wand,
 bid every vernal sweet appear,
 and bloom with early fragrance here! 
yes here, even here, they breathe perfume,
 though wall of melancholy gloom,
 with northern aspect frown rude,
 each bright beam of heaven exclude. 
behold! at nina soft command,
 the flower their velvet leaf expand,
 and sweet, and blue like her own eye,
 (that love in languid peace to lie,
 and bend beautiful in shade,
 seem of the amorous light afraid)
 fresh violet here their charm diffuse,
 and here, with rich mingle hue,
 the gold and purple crocus vie
 to mock the pomp of majesty. 
see how her soul-bewitching smile
 can even selfish love beguile! 
while fair Narcissus bend no more
 his snowy beauty to adore,
 but lift for once his cup of gold
 a fair image to behold. 
dear Nina! teach a grateful heart
 thy own persuasive, win art;
 so may i best my thanks commend,
 so please each kind, each cherish friend! 
for, as thy hand with smile flower
 have crown the linger, wintery hour,
 even thus for i affection care
 have shelter from the nip air
 the tender bud of half-chilled hope
 that seem in wither gloom to droop,
 and bid they bloom, revive again,
 in spite of year, and grief, and pain. 
over i affection love to shed
 her comfort full, unmeasured;
 to bless my smile hearth she send
 the dear smile of dear friend,
 and bid my prison couch assume
 no form of pain, no air of gloom;
 but sweet content and cheerful ease,
 all that in solitude can please,
 and all that soothe, social love
 can bid its quiet favourite prove,
 woo by the voice of tenderness,
 unite my happy home to bless. 
as round that lovely picture wreath
 where Rubens bid his pencil breathe,
 where touch with all its magic power
 glow the rich colour of each flower,
 attendant cherub sweet join,
 and all their odorous wing entwine;
 one cherub guard each blush flower,
 and pure ambrosia seem to shower:
 so, Nina, over each peaceful day
 protect love and kindness play,
 and shed over each some balmy pleasure
 that grateful memory love to treasure!
