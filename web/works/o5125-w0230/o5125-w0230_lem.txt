the mistaken lover.

Strephon the sprightly and the gay,
 love Celia fresh and fair as may:
 none shine so brilliant in the Mall,
 the court, the assembly and the ball;
 none bare at will the laureled prize,
 but Celia with the kill eye. 

it be at the draw room or play,
 (but which our author can say)
 as Celia roll her eye around,
 this youth receive a mortal wound. 
what shall he do? — "commence the beau,
"for woman oft be catch by show. "
the wound Strephon now behold,
 array in coat of green and gold,
 (of which we something may advance)
 the sleeve be alamode de France. 
we leave it here — and haste to tell,
 how smart round his temple fall
 the modish wig. — yet we presume,
 more graceful be the scarlet plume:
 though some rude soldier (doom to bear
 the southern and the northern air,
 and walk through every kind of weather)
 may jeer at strephon scarlet feather;
 and tell we such shall never be wear,
 unless you fight at marstonmoor. 

his person finish, now the care
 be to address and gain the fair:
 he purchase all the song of note,
 and get the lover cant by rote:
 he bribe her footman and her maid,
 and with his nightly serenade
 her vault roof and garden ring:
 for she he ogle, dance and sing;
 be often at her toilet see,
 with sonnet to the paphian queen:
 then at her foot deject lie,
 pray, weep, sigh, die. 

 "be Celia kind?"it shall be know:
 do you think our heart be make of stone? 
yes, she be kind, and to proceed,
 the write draw and friend agree:
 grave Hymen sacred knot be tie,
 and Celia fair commence a bride. 

but i shall pass the wedding-day,
 nor stay to paint the lady gay,
 nor splendour of the light hall,
 the feast, the fiddle, nor the ball. 
a lovely theme! — it be true, but then
 we will leave it to a soft pen:
 those transient joy will fade too soon,
 we will therefore skip the hony-moon. 

it be half a year — it may be more,
 since Celia bring her shine store,
 five thousand pound of sterling clear,
 to bless the mansion of her dear. 

some tell we wife their beauty lose,
 when they have spoil their bridal shoe:
 some learned casuist make it clear,
 a wife may please for half a year:
 and other say, her charm will hold
 as long as the suspend gold;
 but that her bloom be soon decay,
 and wither when her Fortune pay. 

now which of these be celia case,
 (though all be common to her race)
 i shall not rack my brain about,
 but leave the learnt to pick it out. 

this husband, whimsical and gay,
 love music, masquerade, and play,
 be one of those most happy elf,
 that dote upon their charm self:
 who hate dull domestic wall,
 fly here and there as fancy call;
 still in pursuit of something new,
 nor even to their vice true. 

mistaken Strephon find no more
 his celia charm as before:
 her eye! — why, they have lose their fire:
 the rose on her cheek expire. 
her shape — it be alter strange, sure;
 her voice no mortal can endure. 

then to the park where Claudia roll
 her eye to fish for shallow soul:
 or at the play he must appear,
 for lovely Lindamine be there:
 no mortal bell so fair as she,
 if wretched Strephon be but free. 

in the country he delude the morn
 with Ringwood and the hunt horn:
 perhaps may with his dear dine,
 then hey for company and wine;
 wine that will make a hermit gay,
 with music intermix and play. 
for table and for card they call:
 the dice-box rattle in the hall. 

now all be happy nor give over,
 till watch point to number four:
 then see the face of dawn day:
 here Lucy.  "where be your lady, pray? 
"she be go to rest. — there let she be,
 "go make the crimson bed for i."
all this a while in silence pass,
 the lady patience fail at last. 

one morning (so the fate decree)
 alone be sit he and she:
 not yet arrive the roar band,
 nor rake nor coxcomb be at hand. 
this bless occasion please the fair,
 and with a mild and cheerful air,
 she thus begin: "my Strephon say,
"why this deject face to day? 
 "why be thou always cross and dull,
"unless the noisy room be full? 
 "black discontent and anger lie
"close lurk in thy sullen eye;
 "those eye that i with sorrow see
"disgust when they roll on i. 

here cease the great injure bride,
 and Strephon with a blush reply:
 "why, madam, i must own that you,
"have merit, (give the de'l his due)
 "and be the pleasure of my life,
"before you wear the name of wife:
 "but madam, the reason be, i find,
"that while a lover i be blind:
 "and now the fault be not in i,
"it be only this — that i can see. 
i think you once a goddess trim,
 "the grace dwell on every limb:
"but, madam, if you ever be such,
 "methinks you be alter very much:
"as first (i beg your pardon though)
 "you hold your head extreme low:
"and though your shape be not awry,
 "your shoulder stand prodigious high:
"your curl hair i dare have swear,
 "be black than the sable moor:
"but now i find it be only brown,
 "a colour common through the town:
"it be true you be mighty fair — but now
 "i spy a freckle on your brow;
"your lip i own be red and thin,
 "but there be a pimple on your chin:
"beside your eye be grey. — alack! 
 "until now i always think they black. 

 "thus, madam, i the truth have tell;
"it be true, i thank you for your gold;
 "but find in search of my breast,
"that i can part with all the rest. 
he cease — and both be mute a while,
 until Celia answer with a smile:
 "who will have think, my dear, say she,
"that love be blind to this degree;
 "but in my turn i will own it too,
"that i be as much deceive as you:
 "from hence let our example show
"the gay coquette and sprightly beau;
 "that love like they will never hold,
"not though it be cement with gold:
 "let all the youth to you repair,
"for counsel — and to i the fair. 
 "it will help to make our strephons wise,
"and stop the growth of tender lie:
 "and more than Plato moral page
"instruct the celia of the age. 

 "but now, my dear, as you see
"in mutual hatred we agree,
 "methinks it be better we retreat,
"each party to a distant seat;
 "and though we value each the other,
"just as one rush regard another:
 "yet let we often send to hear,
"if health attend the absent dear:
 "and though each other we will shun,
"as debtor do a hateful do:
 "(nor mind the cross of a street)
"yet let we be civil when we meet,
 "and live in short like courtly friend:
"they part — and thus the story end.
