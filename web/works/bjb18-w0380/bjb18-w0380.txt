THIRD DEVOTIONAL SONG.

OUR Father and Almighty Lord,
 By angels and by saints adored,
 With starry brightness circled round,
 Gleam beyond gleam, which hath no bound, —
 Though He be high and we are low,
 Accepts the grateful thanks that flow
 From infant lips, and to the skies,
 Like morning's early vapour rise; —
 The simplest child who lisps a prayer,
 His mercy and his love will share.
