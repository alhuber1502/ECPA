third devotional song.

our father and almighty lord,
 by angel and by saint adore,
 with starry brightness circle round,
 gleam beyond gleam, which have no bound, —
 though he be high and we be low,
 accept the grateful thanks that flow
 from infant lip, and to the sky,
 like morning early vapour rise; —
 the simple child who lisp a prayer,
 his mercy and his love will share.
