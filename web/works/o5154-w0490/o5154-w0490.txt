To the Author of the Farmer's Letters, which were written in IRELAND in the Year of the Rebellion, by HENRY BROOKE, Esq; 1745.

By the Same.

OH thou, whose artless, free-born genius charms,
Whose rustick zeal each patriot bosom warms;
Pursue the glorious task, the pleasing toil,
Forsake the fields and till a nobler soil;
Extend the Farmer's care to human kind,
Manure the heart, and cultivate the mind;
There plant religion, reason, freedom, truth,
And sow the seeds of virtue in our youth:
Let no rank weeds corrupt, or brambles choak,
And shake the vermin from the British oak;
From northern blasts protect the vernal bloom,
And guard our pastures from the wolves of Rome. 
In Britain's liberty ingraft thy name,
And reap the harvest of immortal fame!
