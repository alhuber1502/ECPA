inscription on a summer-house belong to Gilbert west, ESQ. at Wickham, in Kent.

by the same.

not wrap in smoky London sulphurous cloud,
 and not far distant, stand my rural cot:
 neither obnoxious to intrude crowd,
 nor for the good and friendly too remote. 

and when too much repose bring on the spleen,
 or the gay city idle pleasure cloy;
 swift as my change wish i shift the scene,
 and now the country, now the town enjoy.
