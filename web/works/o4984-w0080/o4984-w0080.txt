INSCRIPTION ON A SUMMER-HOUSE BELONGING TO GILBERT WEST, ESQ. AT WICKHAM, IN KENT.

BY THE SAME.

NOT wrapt in smoky London's sulphurous clouds,
 And not far distant, stands my rural cot:
 Neither obnoxious to intruding crowds,
 Nor for the good and friendly too remote. 

And when too much repose brings on the spleen,
 Or the gay city's idle pleasure's cloy;
 Swift as my changing wish I shift the scene,
 And now the country, now the town enjoy.
