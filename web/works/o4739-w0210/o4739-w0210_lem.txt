to ANNA Matilda. 

nor will i more of fate complain;
 for i have live to feel thy strain;
 to feel its sunlike force divine,
 swift dart through the cloud of woe,
 shoot to my soul a saint glow. 
yet, yet, Matilda, spare to shine! 
one moment be the blaze suppress! 
lest from this clod my spirit spring,
 and bear by zephyrs tremble wing,
 seek a new heaven upon thy breast. 
but say, do calm indifference dwell
 on the low mead or mountain swell,
 or at grey evening solemn gloom,
 bend her bosom to the tomb? 
or when the weak dawn orient rise,
 in silvery foliage deck, appear;
 tell i, if perchance she go
 to the fresh garden be proud array,
 where, doubtful of the come day,
 each droop floweret shed translucent tear. 
ah! tell i, tell i where,
 for thou shall find i there,
 like she own son, in vestment pure,
 with deep disguise of smile secure:
 so shall i once thy form descry,
 for once, hold converse with thy eye. 
vain be the thought, for at thy sight,
 soon as thy potent voice be find,
 can i conceal the vast delight,
 can i be tranquil at the sound,
 can i repress quick rapture start,
 or hide the burst of my heart? 
let but thy lyre impatient seize
 depart twilight filmy breeze,
 that wind the enchant chord among,
 in linger labyrinth of song:
 anon, the amorous bird of woe
 shall steal the tone that quiver flow,
 and with they sooth the sigh wood,
 and with they charm the slumber flood;
 till, all exhaust by the lay,
 he hang in silence on the spray,
 drop to his idle flower beneath,
 and, amid her blush, cease to breathe. 

warn by his fate, it be sure well
 to shun the fascinate spell;
 nor still, presumptuous, dare to fling
 my rude hand over the sound string;
 as though i fond will aspire,
 to match matilda heavenly fire. 
yet may i sometime, far remote,
 hear the love cadence of her note,
 and though the laurel i resign,
 o may the bliss of taste be mine!
