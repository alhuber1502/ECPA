a imitation of the sixteenth ode of the third book of Horace.

believe i, sir, your cost and care,
 your dog and lock, your bolt and bar,
 your palisade, and wall of brass,
 be all too weak, when gold attack the place. 
a brazen tower Acrisius rear;
 a brazen tower, he think, will guard
 his daughter from the lecherous arm
 of those who nightly seek her charm;
 while surly mastiff watch the dame,
 and thunder, tell if lover come:
 these keep the nymph from god and man,
 not Jove himself can enter in;
 till Venus (wondrous to behold!) 
transform his godship into gold. 
o Stanley, Stanley! gold have power
 the stern heart to move,
 to burst the wall, or pierce the tower,
 impervious even to Jove. 
gold can the subtle head deceive,
 or peace, or war can bring,
 buy vote, raise Gallic arm, and give
 the polander a king. 

Apollo know the force of gold,
 when philip martial fate he thus foretell:
 "the sharp lance of steel may err,
" so may the sure bow;
 "but know, o king, the golden spear
" will vanquish every foe. " 
the God advice the prince pursue;
 he fight with gold, and gold subdue:
 whence some historian say, it be this,
 and not young ammon father, conquer Greece. 
gold have a absolute command;
 it rule at sea, as well as land:
 for, when two adverse fleet engage,
 and firy tube displode their rage;
 a bribe can make their thunder cease,
 and hush the watery world to peace. 

yet, notwithstanding all its force,
 it often bring the great curse. 
vexatious care and discontent
 increase gold attend;
 desire enlarge, as wealth augment;
 for avarice know no end.
 we labour up the golden hill with pain;
 but never surmount the tower Alps of gain. 

o Stanley, honour of my muse! 
i fear, and just fear,
 to steer the course ambition show,
 or soar beyond my sphere. 
he be poor, who always after wealth aspire;
 he be rich, who always curb his own desire. 
i more admire a humble seat,
 than all the pomp, which vex the great;
 and from their gild roof retire,
 on isis bank to tune my lyre. 
in this retreat i be noble bless,
 than Croesus ever can be,
 than if (like miser) i possess
 a wealthy poverty. 
while favour by the best of queen,
 who all my want supply;
 while fragrant groves, and flowery scene,
 delight my muse eye;
 my fate a far superior bless bring,
 than all the pageantry of eastern king. 
what though no flock, on Richmond plain,
 with fleece deck my pride? 
what though i seldom drink champagne,
 or quaff the purple tide? 
if these i want, be your bard to ask,
 i know, your generous soul will send a cask. 
i make my want and wealth agree;
 i pay my debt no worse than he,
 who over the sea extend his reign,
 and add all Sicily to Spain. 
who covet most, be most in need,
 and always ride a restless steed,
 which foam, and fly without controul,
 still seek, but never obtain the goal. 
then happy those, who heaven have bless,
 with what may life sustain;
 nor be with pinch want depress,
 nor curse with too much gain:
 for boundless wealth never fill a boundless mind;
 the man who still pursue, be still behind.
