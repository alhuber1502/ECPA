a pastoral on the queen.

(Phillis.)

why (Philomela) sleep those cheerful strain,
 with which so much you gratify the plain? 
when every murmur stream and pretty spring
 of some soft tale will stop to hear thou sing
 in note, that all the nymph and shepherd move;
 and Theron too, have he be by, have love. 
but ah! unwelcome alteration, now
 no pleasant smile, or wreathe, adorn thy brow:
 about the plain thy flock neglect, stray;
 and thou, as careless and forlorn as they:
 in hollow rock, and cypress shade, alone,
 do teach the mournful dove a sad moan. 
for, all i hear from thou, when listen by,
 be break note, of some sad elegy:
 but such a great and unaffected air
 thy solitary lamentation be,
 i find, no selfish grief, or interest
 can draw those generous murmur from thy breast. 
it be sure, the public loss thou do condole;
 it be that which yet lie press on thy soul. 

(Philomela.)

it be that indeed, our common loss and care,
 which, in my breast, claim this unvulgar share;
 too sad claim it: oh! the queen, the queen
 have leave the world: but heaven! how black a scene
 her exit make it? — oh illustrious saint! 
(by death, from our most warm caress rend;
 can i but speak thy worth: but that be a theme
 too mighty for my bold thought to stem:
 even my own grief, i have no word to paint,
 nor find my love a elegant complaint. 
my lyre it self no more can give i ease,
 (nor the strong tumult of my soul appease;
 no more can give my swell breast relief,)
 then fate reverse the subject of my grief:
 it be all in vain —
 alas! the royal shepherdess be go;
 and, with she, the whole sex glory fly. 
oh! can not all those heavenly virtue save
 divine Maria from the insatiate grave? 
nor she, and our dear hero move tear? 
nor all the poor lament nation fear? 
no, no; they can not — she resign her breath;
 the charm queen a trophy fall to death.
