song.

i 

from thou, ELIZA, i must go,
 and from my native shore:
 the cruel fate between we throw
 a boundless ocean roar;
 but boundless ocean, roar wide,
 between my love and i,
 they never, never can divide
 my heart and soul from thou. 

ii.

farewell, farewell, ELIZA dear,
 the maid that i adore! 
a bode voice be in my ear,
 we part to meet no more! 
but the late throb that leave my heart,
 while death stand victor by,
 that throb, ELIZA, be thy part,
 and thy that late sigh!
