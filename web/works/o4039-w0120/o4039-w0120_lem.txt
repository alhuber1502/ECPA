elegy.

haste, haste, you solemn messenger of night,
 spread the black mantle on the shrink plain;
 but, ah! my torment still survive the light,
 the change season alter not my pain. 
you variegate child of the spring;
 you blossom blush with the pearly dew;
 you bird that sweet in the hawthorn sing;
 you flowery meadow, lawn of verdant hue,
 faint be your colour; harsh your love-note thrill,
 to i no pleasure nature now can yield:
 alike the barren rock and woody hill,
 the dark-brown blast heath, and fruitful field. 
you spout cataract, you silver stream;
 you spacious river, who the willow shrowd;
 ascend the bright-crowned sun far-shining beam,
 to aid the mournful tear-distilling cloud. 
you noxious vapour, fall upon my head;
 you writhe adder, round my foot entwine;
 you toad, your venom in my footpath spread;
 you blast meteor, upon i shine. 
you circle season, intercept the year;
 forbid the beauty of the spring to rise;
 let not the life-preserving grain appear;
 let howl tempest harrow up the sky. 
you cloud-girt, moss-grown turret, look no more
 into the palace of the god of day:
 you loud tempestuous billow, cease to roar,
 in plaintive number, through the valley stray. 
you verdant-vested tree, forget to grow,
 cast off the yellow foliage of your pride:
 you soft tinkle rivulet, cease to flow,
 or swell with certain death and poison, glide. 
you solemn warbler of the gloomy night,
 that rest in lightning-blasted oak the day,
 through the black mantle take your slow-paced flight,
 rend the silent wood with shriek lay. 
you snow-crowned mountain, lose to mortal eye,
 down to the valley bend your hoary head,
 you livid comet, fire the people sky —
 for — lady Betty tabby cat be dead.
