the Chelsea pensioner. 

when war have break in on the peace of old man,
 and from Chelsea to arm they be summon again;
 two veteran grow grey, with their musket sore soil,
 with a sigh be relate how hard they have toil;
 the drum it be beat, to fight they incline,
 but aye they look back to the day of langsyne. 

oh! Davy, man, well thou remember the time,
 when two brisk young callans, and both in our prime,
 the duke bid we conquer, and show we the way,
 and money a braw chiel we lay low on that day;
 yet i will venture, full cheerful, this old trunk of i,
 can William but lead, and i fight, as langsyne. 

but garrison duty be all we can do,
 though our arm be wear weak yet our heart be still true;
 we care for danger by land or by sea,
 for time be turn coward and no thou and i;
 and though at the change we shall sad repine,
 youth will return, nor the strength of langsyne. 

when after our conquest, it joy i to mind
 how thy Janet caress thou and my Meg be kind;
 they follow our fortune, though never so hard,
 and we care not for plunder with such a reward;
 even now they be resolve baith their hame to resign,
 and will follow we yet for the sake of langsyne.
