to dr. Oliver, who correct my bath poem. 

while rash, unknowing of Parnassus' height,
 my virgin Muse attempt the unequal flight;
 the croud ill-judging, and her partial friend
 or veil her fault, or blind each commend:
 while the just critic silent censure show;
 blame this dull thought, that diction much too low:
 cautious and tremble now she fear to fly,
 you plume her wing, and bid she bold try. 
yet blind wander, when she aim to rise,
 you clear the mist of error from her eye;
 you smooth her verse, and blot th'unmeaning line,
 improve the thought, and aid the lame design. 
with chemic art the chaos you divide,
 extract the spirit, bid the phlegm subside;
 correct, new range, precipitate, confine;
 you be the skill, the mean material mine
 you, her Apollo, give the muse she fire,
 whenever she please, it be when you inspire;
 even pope approve, when you have tune her lyre. 
the debt of honour bid i not conceal;
 i will dare your friendship, and the truth reveal. 
no base ingratitude shall taint my name;
 i will keep my virtue, tho'i lose my fame. 
my honest pride disdain to steal the bay,
 or, like the moon, to shine with borrow ray. 
the great merit that my muse can show,
 be that she stand correct and fair by you. 
not only fame, but health to you i owe:
 when my joint tremble, and my pulse beat low,
 when all my friend have take a part sigh,
 and tear drop silent from a parent eye;
 though neither youth nor beauty be my friend,
 nor gold nor fame can tempt, yet you attend. 
while soft compassion languish in your eye,
 and gentle breathe in sympathetic sigh,
 pure goodness winge your foot, inspire your tongue;
 soft be your accent, but your reason strong. 
heaven bid i live, and you prescribe the way;
 to you, next heaven, my grateful thanks i pay. 
and now i breathe, and live, and sing anew;
 and owe my breath, and life, and song to you
