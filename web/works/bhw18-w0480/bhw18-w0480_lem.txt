the traveller in haste;

address to THOMAS Clarkson, ESQ. in 1814, when many english arrive at Paris, but remain a very short time.

love ENGLAND! now the narrow sea
 in vain will separate France and thou:
 may favour zephyr swell the sail
 that waft the crowd my wish hail! 
stranger to i, they hither roam,
 but english accent speak of home;
 and Scotia, still more dear to i
 be those which lead i back to thou! 
accent that wake with magic power
 the spirit of depart hour! —
 ah, lose to i thy fir-clad hill,
 the music of thy mountain-rills, —
 yet ever shall the memory last,
 "pleasant and mournful" of the past. 
but here, from scene so new, so strange,
 where meditation long may range,
 and taste may fix her ardent eye,
 how swift the rapid traveller fly! 
what haste to come, what haste to go,
 unknowing half they wish to know;
 delight as they rush along,
 but not less eager to be go. 
in vain the art unfold their gate,
 for there no stranger ever wait;
 in vain unlock that wealth sublime
 immortal genius wrist from time: —
 ah, wherefore open the classic book,
 for those who have no time to look? 
who amid the academic bower,
 on breguet call to mark the hour;
 through the long gallery swift advance,
 and judge perfection with a glance! 
but to what class do he belong
 who come less eager to be go,
 and yet inflexible refuse
 to heed the art, or court the muse? 
the group that press to give the "Apollo"
 a part glance, he scorn to follow;
 in vain the "Venus" may expect
 one look, and wonder at neglect;
 for Clarkson slight all form of beauty, —
 not that he think indifference duty,
 but dear pleasure fill the space
 of classic charm, and attic grace: —
 he come at this decisive hour
 in pity cause, to plead with power;
 his embassy be from the slave,
 his diplomatic skill to save! 
he come the fetter to unbind,
 to stipulate for half mankind;
 and when applause record his name,
 sigh that philanthropy be fame.
