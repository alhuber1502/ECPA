sonnet [21] xxi. suppose to be write by Werter. 

go! cruel tyrant of the human breast! 
to other heart, thy burn arrow bear;
 go, where fond hope, and fair illusion rest! 
ah! why shall love inhabit with despair! 
like the poor maniac i linger here,
 still haunt the scene, where all my treasure lie;
 still seek for flower, where only thorn appear,
 'and drink delicious poison from her eye!' 
towards the deep gulph that open on my sight
 i hurry forward, passion helpless slave! 
and scorn reason mild and sober light,
 pursue the path that lead i to the grave! 
so round the flame the giddy insect fly,
 and court the fatal fire, by which it die!
