on the d—ss of R—D. 

by the same.

what do scholar, and bard, and astronomer wise,
 mean by stuff our head with nonsense and lie;
 by tell we Venus must always appear
 in a car, or a shell, or a twinkle star;
 draw by sparrow, or swan, or dolphin, or dove,
 attend in form by the grace and love:
 that ambrosia and nectar be all she will taste,
 and her passport to heart on a belt round her waist? 

without all this bustle i see the bright dame,
 to supper last night to P—y's she come
 in a good warm sedan; no fine open car;
 two chairman her dove, and a flambeau she star;
 no nectar she drink, no ambrosia she eat;
 her cup be plain claret, a chicken her meat:
 nor want a cestus she bosom to grace,
 for r—d, that night, have lend she her face.
