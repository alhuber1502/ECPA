To Mrs. CÃ†sar, at the Speaker's Lodgings at Bath. 

When lately you acquitted me,
 With Carteret I din'd;
 And, in Return, (tho' grievous) thee
 To Onslow I resign'd. 

'Tis wise the happy Hour to seize;
 For, search the Nation round,
 Such Peers, or Commoners, as these,
 Where are they to be found? 

Our Situation's chang'd you see:
 (How Pleasures fleet away!) 
But Yesterday you envy'd me;
 I envy you To-day.
