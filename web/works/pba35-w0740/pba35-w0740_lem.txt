to mrs. CÃ†sar, at the speaker lodging at bath. 

when late you acquit i,
 with Carteret i dine;
 and, in return, (though grievous) thou
 to Onslow i resign. 

it be wise the happy hour to seize;
 for, search the nation round,
 such peer, or commoner, as these,
 where be they to be find? 

our situation change you see:
 (how pleasure fleet away!) 
but yesterday you envy i;
 i envy you today.
