song.

to Almeria.

though since i love a age be fly,
 the blissful hour you still postpone;
 Ah! lovely maid, no long frown,
 but each fond hope with rapture crown. 

nor think, though lure by angel charm,
 that time will linger in thy arm;
 Oh! no; his scythe shall crop the rose
 that on thy cheek divine blow. 

but ere the russian riot there,
 to nature yield, enchant fair;
 nor more my ardent wish reprove,
 for know, life rich boon be love.
