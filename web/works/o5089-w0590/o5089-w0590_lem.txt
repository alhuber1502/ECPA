mr. dodsley answer.

yes, yes, my friend, my heart i own
 be weak, be vain enough to have show
 that ode among its better;
 but prudence whisper in my ear,
 be diffident, nor press so near
 to rank with man of letter. 

aim not in that select wreath,
 where bud of sweet odour breath,
 to mix thy faint bloom;
 nor dare to place with flower so bright,
 pale hemlock, and cold aconite,
 to poison their perfume. 

abash i listen, yet obey
 the friendly voice, and to the shade
 Melpomene be drive;
 but mark the event, it be hence she shine,
 with lustre from your partial line
 her own can never have give.
