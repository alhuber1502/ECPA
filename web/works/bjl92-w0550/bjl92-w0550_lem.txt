a young lady lamentation

for the loss of her sister by marriage.

what tongue can half my woe express? 
what force of eloquence can tell? 
the cause of my deep distress
 be such as ever seem to swell. 

my parent not ignoble be;
 my father once a merchant fame;
 but now in a superior sphere,
 among land gentleman he be name. 

my mother of no mean extract:
 the famous Freyburgh give her birth;
 with wit and prudence still she will act;
 none more accomplish on earth. 

my brother all for valour fame,
 their merit great, what pen can show;
 their praise have be by fame proclaim,
 while just in esteem they grow. 

i have one only sister dear;
 our parent joy and pride be we;
 our charm attractive do appear
 to man of high and low degree:

who often time, in soft address,
 do strive our favour to obtain,
 while we of fortitude possess,
 refuse their offer with disdain. 

they vow we will their ruin prove,
 persist in our cruelty;
 but we be wont to laugh at love,
 and little Cupid dart defy. 

we ever arm be cap-a-pee;
 indifference be our favourite shield;
 but by some fatal destiny,
 my sister languish in the field. 

deprive of all defensive arm,
 (i sigh, my tear begin to flow)
 and slay by a sea captain charm,
 she marry be a month ago. 

in a unlucky moment he,
 from Plutus sure have learn the art,
 make his empoison arrow flee,
 till one of they do pierce her heart. 

she do not wish to find relief,
 but a ignoble victim fall,
 which fill our parent heart with grief;
 their sorrow great what tongue can tell? 

the balsam of advice be bring,
 with drop of strict authority;
 prescription still to shun she seek,
 nor will the medicine apply. 

with water of forgetfulness,
 she oft be bid to bathe the wound:
 the search be vain, she do protest
 this water never can be find. 

it grieve we much thus to behold
 our counsel slight with disdain:
 his feather dart be tip with gold,
 which render every effort vain. 

but conscious that our parent dear
 can not behold the fatal blow,
 to make the stroke seem less severe,
 she at a distance meet the foe. 

her peerless charm she there resign,
 comply by love supreme command;
 a clown by travel much refine
 do eager clasp her beauteous hand. 

i will lament a sister lose. 
ah! lady hear my piteous moan,
 deprive of what i once can boast,
 i now must keep the field alone. 

what though i no assistance have,
 i hope to act courag'ous,
 the subtle foe still to outbrave,
 and man seduce art defy. 

the rich, the poor, the proud, the slave,
 the fop, the clown, the low, the tall,
 the gay, the giddy, or the grave,
 i scornful defy they all.
