a pastoral dialogue.

Damon. 

o Theron, say what mean that down-cast eye,
 what new find grief have teach thy breast to sigh? 
have some intrude swain thy purpose cross? 
or have some favourite ewe her lambkin lose? 
assume thy wonted cheerfulness dear lad,
 or tell thy Damon why thou look so sad. 

Theron. 

fresh as the spring, and fair as open day,
 my Jessy smile, and steal my heart away;
 but when of love i do to she complain,
 she scarce smile, nor answer i again:
 none ever can think, but those that feel the smart,
 so fair a form can hide so hard a heart. 

Damon. 

ah, silly swain! and be thy beauty make,
 for the cool frown of one false nymph to fade? 
o Theron, Theron, scorn the power of love,
 forbid the tender impulse to move:
 see how that bee forsake the bloom may,
 and leave it for the next that come this way. 

Theron. 

must i, like fickle Jessy, learn to slight? 
yes, — what my Damon say be always right. 
see thou that nymph, beneath the shady tree? 
she look this way; i wish she look at i:
 if ever thy Theron shall his heart transfer
 from his lose Jessy, it must go to she. 

Damon. 

o say no more — no more of she, my friend;
 for she be i — my Doris! — o suspend —
 suspend thy choice, my swain, till thou have see
 the village maid assemble on the green;
 and if you will your fickle heart transfer,
 then take your choice of all the rest but she. 

Theron. 

why be you angry now, my friend, my swain! 
your own advice i will give you back again:
 o Damon, Damon, scorn the power of love;
 forgo your nymph, your simile to prove:
 forsake she, as the bee forsake there may,
 and i will be the next that come this way.
