on leave bath.

the briton, in their nature shy,
 view stranger with a distant eye:
 we think they partial and severe;
 and judge their manner by their air:
 be undeceived by time alone;
 their value rise, as they be know. 

here many a worthy mind i find,
 with sense and taste, by virtue crown,
 at once so true good and great,
 they know to bear a prosperous state. 

few take from noble blood pretence
 to act or look with insolence:
 vein, with the rich purple die,
 but seldom swell the heart with pride,
 so, though the river-god, from high,
 with plenteous urn the stream supply,
 which still enlarge, as they descend,
 roll down, and in the ocean end,
 through age pour; yet, to our eye,
 old ocean be too great to rise. 

the generous treatment i have meet,
 have run i deep in albion debt:
 and, can my artless line impart
 the grateful dictate of my heart,
 late posterity shall know
 the sense i have of what i owe. 

dear bath, a long, a last adieu! 
since i no more shall visit you;
 nor fix by choice, but bar by fate,
 from a felicity so great. 
o may thy water ever be
 healthful to other, as to i! 
have Ovid, with prophetic view,
 behold the wonder wrought by you,
 medea art he may have spare,
 and life by thou alone repair.
