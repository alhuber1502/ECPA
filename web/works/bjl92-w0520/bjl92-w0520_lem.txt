from Delia to Alonzo. 

who have send she a slight epistle.

sir, i your letter do peruse;
 so elegant the style you use,
 abash, confound i do muse
 strike with amaze;
 great wit and learning you diffuse
 in all your lay. 

you have be upon parnassus top,
 more high than Alexander pope;
 and wild arabia plain you grope
 for Phoenix rare,
 that useful knowledge you may drop,
 while dunce stare. 

your Pegasus, still on the wing,
 more sweet than philomel you sing;
 and swift from distant clime you bring
 note hard to read:
 do Phoenix, sir, from ash spring? 
it be strange indeed. 

but more difficult it be to scan,
 that dire, deceitful creature man;
 of all the work in nature plan,
 sure none can be
 so intricate to understand,
 as mystic he. 

his breast be fill with mazy wile;
 his countenance store with fickle smile:
 his flatter speech too oft beguile
 pure innocence;
 and when he write, his lofty style
 replete with sense. 

such eloquence do merit praise;
 deep erudition swell your lay:
 you seem the laureate of our day;
 and all the nine,
 your mighty character to raise,
 do now combine. 

it be pity, sir, that such as you
 shall agriculture path pursue,
 or destine be to hold the plough
 on the cold plain;
 more fit that laurel deck the brow
 of such a swain. 

yet Homer part few do commend,
 till death his doleful day do end;
 then seven city do contend
 a right to claim;
 each vow from thence he do descend,
 so great his fame. 

perhaps, sir, in some future age,
 strike with the beauty of your page,
 old scotia chieftain may engage
 your name to raise;
 more have they to excite their rage,
 than Homer lay. 

but i must drop the ponderous theme,
 lest you my weak attempt shall blame;
 so sure your title be to fame,
 who run may read;
 of such your merit to proclaim
 you have no need. 

know then, that love within my breast,
 have never yet be know to rest;
 nor will i harbour such a guest,
 to give i pain:
 i wish you, sir, so much distress,
 soon well again.
