write on whitsun-monday 1795. 

at a open window sit,
 on this day of mirth and glee,
 across a flowery vista flit,
 many pass form i see. 
ah! lovely prospect, stay awhile! 
and long glad my dote eye,
 with poverty delight smile,
 and lighten step, as pass by;

with labour spruce and ruddy train,
 deck out in all their best array,
 who, month of toil and care disdain,
 pay by the pleasure of a day. 
the village girl still let i view,
 hasten to the neighbour fair;
 her cap adorn with pink or blue,
 and nice smooth her glossy hair. 

with sparkle eye and smile face,
 tinge over with beauty warm glow;
 with timid air, and humble grace,
 with clear and undepressed brow. 
go! lovely girl, and share the day,
 to thy industrious merit due;
 there join the dance, or choral lay;
 thou bloom, village rose, adieu! 

and thou, o youth, so blythe and free,
 bound swift over the plain,
 go, taste the joy of liberty,
 and cheer thy spirit, happy swain! 
how different to the lonely hour,
 when slow follow the plough,
 self-buoyant joy forget the power,
 which warm thy gladden bosom now. 

if some rural prize desire,
 or ambitious of applause,
 loud huzza thy wish fire,
 thy steady hand the furrow draw;
 never a victor fame in story,
 great praise and reverence draw,
 than thou, attire in humble glory,
 so, guiltless conqueror, adieu! 

oh, here a charm group appear! 
a cottage family, so gay,
 who youthful hope, unchecked by fear,
 in smile of thoughtless rapture play. 
here, bear in fond, parental arm,
 the infant rove eye we view;
 boast a thousand, thousand charm,
 endear innocent, adieu! 

they go! no more with beat heart,
 and lively, dance step to tread;
 unwilling will they depart,
 to seek again their homely shed. 
ah! eve, i love thy veil of grey,
 which will conceal they from my view,
 for, bend home their weary way,
 how sad will be our last adieu!
