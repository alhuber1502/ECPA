On Miss * * * *.

ODE X.

I.

LONG, with undistinguish'd flame,
 I lov'd each fair, each witty dame,
 My heart the belle-assembly gain'd,
 And all an equal sway maintain'd. 

II.

But when you came, you stood confess'd
 Sole sultana of my breast;
 For you eclips'd, supremely fair,
 All the whole seraglio there. 

III.

In this her mien, in that her grace,
 In a third I lov'd a face;
 But you in ev'ry feature shine
 Universally divine. 

IV.

What can those tumid paps excel,
 Do they sink, or do they swell? 
While those lovely wanton eyes
 Sparkling meet them, as they rise. 

V.

Thus is silver Cynthia seen,
 Glistening o'er the glassy green. 
While attracted swell the waves,
 Emerging from their inmost caves. 

VI.

When to sweet sounds your steps you suit,
 And weave the minuet to the lute,
 Heav'ns! how you glide! — her neck — her chest —
 Does she move, or does she rest? 

VII.

As those roguish eyes advance,
 Let me catch their side-long glance,
 Soon — or they'll elude my sight,
 Quick as light'ning, and as bright. 

VIII.

Thus the bashful Pleiad cheats
 The gazer's eye, and still retreats,
 Then peeps agen — then skulks unseen,
 Veil'd behind the azure skreen. 

IX.

Like the ever-toying dove,
 Smile immensity of love;
 Be Venus in each outward part,
 And wear the vestal in your heart. 

X.

When I ask a kiss, or so —
 Grant it with a begging no,
 And let each rose that decks your face
 Blush assent to my embrace.
