on miss * * * *.

ode x. 

i 

long, with undistinguished flame,
 i love each fair, each witty dame,
 my heart the belle-assembly gain,
 and all a equal sway maintain. 

ii.

but when you come, you stand confess
 sole sultana of my breast;
 for you eclipse, supreme fair,
 all the whole seraglio there. 

iii.

in this her mien, in that her grace,
 in a third i love a face;
 but you in every feature shine
 universal divine. 

iv.

what can those tumid pap excel,
 do they sink, or do they swell? 
while those lovely wanton eye
 sparkle meet they, as they rise. 

v. 

thus be silver Cynthia see,
 glisten over the glassy green. 
while attract swell the wave,
 emerge from their inmost cave. 

vi.

when to sweet sound your step you suit,
 and weave the minuet to the lute,
 heaven! how you glide! — her neck — her chest —
 do she move, or do she rest? 

vii.

as those roguish eye advance,
 let i catch their sidelong glance,
 soon — or they will elude my sight,
 quick as lightning, and as bright. 

viii.

thus the bashful Pleiad cheat
 the gazer eye, and still retreat,
 then peep again — then skulk unseen,
 veil behind the azure skreen. 

ix.

like the ever-toying dove,
 smile immensity of love;
 be Venus in each outward part,
 and wear the vestal in your heart. 

x. 

when i ask a kiss, or so —
 grant it with a beg no,
 and let each rose that deck your face
 blush assent to my embrace.
