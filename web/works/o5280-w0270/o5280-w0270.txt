THE BIRTH OF BLISS.

TO THE HONOURABLE GEORGE LESLIE, SON OF THE EARL OF LEVEN, &c.

WHEN first in Eden's roseate bow'rs
 Adam mark'd the lonely hours;
 Though in life no pain he knew,
 Yet from life few joys he drew:
 Still the social passions slept,
 Hope alone her vigil kept;
 Thus in Eden's hallow'd shade,
 Sweetly sang the blue-ey'd maid:
 "Tenant of this happy plain,
 Stranger, blest, to ev'ry pain,
 Still imperfect is thy state,
 What is life without a mate? 
Rising with the second morn
 Lovely woman shall be born;
 Blest with her thy breast shall know
 Charms divine from love that flow." 
Pausing here, the blue-ey'd maid
 Ceas'd to sing in Eden's shade. 
Charm'd by strains so sweet, so blest,
 The common father sunk to rest;
 When appear'd the second dawn,
 Pleas'd, he trod the verdant lawn. 
Seated 'neath a woodbine's shade
 Soon he saw the perfect maid;
 Each in mutual wonder gaz'd;
 Love within each bosom blaz'd. 
Rosy blushes tinge the fair;
 Smiling cherubs bless the pair:
 Each transported with their lot,
 Join to bless the nuptial knot
 To a more sequester'd shade
 Adam led the blushing maid;
 Lock'd within each other's arms,
 Gazing on each other's charms;
 Each exchang'd a balmy kiss,
 Giving thus a birth to bliss.
