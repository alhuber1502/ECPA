SONG.

SUNG BY A CHORUS OF PEASANTS.

TO THE HON. MRS. HOBART.

GRIEF and Mis'ry, hence away,
 This is Nina's wedding day;
 All her sorrows now are past. 
May her joys for ever last. 

Joy attend this happy pair;
 He is brave as she is fair. 
Guarded by the God of Love,
 May they ever constant prove!
