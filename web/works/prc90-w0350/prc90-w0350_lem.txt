a song

when the lovely young Edwin be lay to repose,
 at the dawn of the day, when bright Phoebus arise,
 the bay and the laurel do serve for a shade,
 and the myrtle and willow support his head. 

the lark and the linnet arise on the spray,
 and the lamb all around he do frolic and play;
 even the bee be entice with such sweetness and grace,
 and, in quest of his honey, do light on his face.
