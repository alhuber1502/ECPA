A SONG

When the lovely young Edwin was laid to repose,
 At the dawn of the day, when bright Phoebus arose,
 The bays and the laurels did serve for a shade,
 And the myrtles and willows supported his head. 

The lark and the linnet arose on the spray,
 And the lambs all around him did frolic and play;
 E'en the bee was entic'd with such sweetness and grace,
 And, in quest of his honey, did light on his face.
