song.

you gentle gale, that careless blow
 regardless of a lover sigh;
 you stream, unheeding, as you flow,
 the wretch who on your margin die:
 far from these bank i fly to prove
 if absence be a cure for love. 

yet say, my heart, can distant plain,
 though ever so fair the flower they boast,
 can clear stream assuage thy pain,
 and give thou back thy quiet lose? 
ah no; and thou, alas! will prove
 that absence be no cure for love.
