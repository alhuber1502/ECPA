the elevation. 

1. 

o how ambitious be my soul,
how high she now aspire!
there be nothing can on earth controul,
or limit her desire.

2. 

upon the wing of thought she fly
above the reach of sight,
and find a way through pathless sky
to everlasting light:

3. 

from whence with blameless scorn she view
the folly of mankind;
and smile to see how each pursue
joy fleet as the wind.

4. 

yonder the little ball of earth,
it lessen as i rise;
that stage of transitory mirth,
of last misery:

5. 

my scorn do into pity turn,
and i lament the fate
of soul, that still in body mourn,
for fault which they create:

6. 

soul without spot, till flesh they wear,
which their pure substance stain:
while they the uneasy burden bear,
they be never free from pain.
