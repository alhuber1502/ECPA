to another person.

say, gentle shepherd, shall this day,
 propitious to my amorous lay,
 infuse through all thy vital frame
 the tender, tremble, thrill flame? 

this day prefer the lover prayer,
 this day the yield fair one hear;
 shall bloom Strephon then repine
 at be hail a valentine? 

o! turn thy eye, and view yond dove,
 he will charm thy every sense to love;
 while, from the bend spray, his mate
 shall love-inspired note repeat. 

then, while thy eager charm eye
 run over these line, may love arise
 within thy breast to equal mine,
 nor read in vain my valentine. 

my powerless pen despair to name
 what rapture wait a mutual flame;
 then be thy soft wish mine,
 i will bless the day of valentine.
