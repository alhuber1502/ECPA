to Lorenzo.

go, distant shore and bright conquest seek,
 but my affection will your scorn survive! 
for not from radiant eye or crimson cheek
 my fondness i, or you your power derive; —

nor spring the passion from your fancy love;
 to i, your smile no dear delusion cause;
 i see you tower my humble hope above,
 and, ere i love, i shudder, tremble, pause. 

but i be form to prize superior worth,
 and feel it be virtue you, with love, to see;
 i hope a choice so glorious may call forth
 merit like you, Lorenzo, even in i. —
 then go, assure that i be no transient flame,
 for on your worth it feed, and live upon your fame.
