the old carl will have take i fain.

the old carl will have take i fain,
 and trou' my dad will gar i have he;
 but troth he will find himself mistake, —
 when wrang be it duty to obey he? 
i tell he but the other night
 how sweer i be to cross his passion;
 that age and youth have different sight,
 and see thing in another fashion. 

quo' he, now Meg, it can be
 but that you think the carl handsome;
 he be young by a year than i,
 and goud have for a kingdom ransom. 
come, take advice and be his wife,
 it be fine to be a old man deary;
 It be warrant you will lead a happy life,
 and aye by mistress, never fear you. 

my mither then lay by her wheel,
 and say, dear Joe, why will you tease she? 
i ken you lo'e our lassie well,
 for all your joy have be to please she. 
nay, come now, think upon the time,
 when you be just of the same fancy,
 when i be young and in my prime,
 you cry — never take a old man, Nancy. 

then father like a tempest rise,
 and swear the carl shall be the man;
 that wife be certain to oppose,
 whatever be the husband plan:
 but Monday, miss, shall be the day;
 and, hark you, gin you dare refuse i,
 one shilling never shall you have,
 practice what art you like to abuse i. 

to lo'e the carl that be so old,
 Alak! it be not in my nature;
 save but three hair he will have be bald,
 and wear no wig to look the better:
 the staff he be use this twenty year
 i see he burn it in the fire;
 sae young the gowk try to appear,
 and fain will have make ilk wrinkle liar. 

my Sandy have not muckle gear,
 but then he have a air so genty;
 he be aye so canty, you will have swear
 that he have goud and silver plenty. 
he say he care not for my wealth;
 and though we get nought from my daddy,
 he will cate for i while he be health, —
 Goodnight—I be off then with my laddie.
