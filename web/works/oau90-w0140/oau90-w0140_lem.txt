Paid for peep:

a poem, occasion by a peep hole into a chamber where a beautiful and virtuous young lady lodge, through which undiscovered, i can observe all her action.

i 

Actaeon thus admire stand,
to see bright Cynthia bless the flood
with her soul charm naked limb:
he sigh, and wish for such a wife,
till peep cost the fool his life,
not get further off betimes.

ii.

though not such dreadful fate i have,
nor yet so dear for peep pay;
nor feel such strange and fatal smart,
though all my star propitious stand,
to save the shed of my blood,
insensible i lose my heart.

iii.

sweet innocence well guard lay
to charm my peep soul away,
with beauty penetrate ray;
my wanton thought that hope to see,
something well worthy raillery,
be whole take up with praise.

iv.

sometime i find she close at prayer,
and sometime comb of her hair,
which on her back do curl lie;
sometime with neck and breast all bare
she stand as she be plant there,
my heart to murder through my eye.

v. 

yet shy of every nudity,
so modest that she seem to i
of such a timorous bashful soul,
as if she have discover be,
or that she real have see
i fond peep through the hole.

vi.

the satyr, as old tale recount,
gaze on Diana in the fount,
besot with a brutish passion:
but i be dash from that degree,
for all the brutal part in i,
be turn to humble adoration.

vii.

even i, be to devotion bend,
see that dear, that pretty saint
with providence so oft confer;
yet when to heaven i send my prayer,
before it have get half way there,
my wander thought fly down to she.

viii.

then sometime smother zeal will fire,
burst to flash of desire,
i envy heaven the time she pray;
methinks that face, that bloom youth,
those lovely eye, that pretty mouth,
be for eternal kiss make.

ix.

sometime she will laugh and talk of love,
sometime on grave matter prove,
that she well-skilled in book have be;
sometime she will read, and sometime write,
her little hand no snow so white,
nor any river-swan so clean.

x. 

bold, not know she abuse,
she will put her stocking on and shoe,
then roll a Gartar above knee,
her foot and leg, and tempt thigh,
and every beauty that be by,
all careless expose to i.

xi.

and many a sacred Sunday morn,
naked as ever she be bear,
ere she be ready to be dress,
i have see she put clean linen on,
while to my greedy eye be show
more beauty than can be express.

xii.

child be tell that maid be free
from nature liquid quality,
impose thus on childish wit;
and faith, have i not see the pot,
she be so neat i shall have think,
she have do nothing else but spet.

xiii.

to free my self from all dispute,
this scruple better to confute,
i once resolve to press more near;
but ah, here end all my joy,
she find my cranny, hear my noise,
and stand half dead betwixt shame and fear.

xiv.

as in some fat and plashy ground,
a Fowler have a Covey find,
all feed at the noon of day;
by his robust and blunder noise,
the game have raise, they mount the sky,
and fright, post with speed away:

XV. 

so from that hour no game be see,
no fairy land, nor fairy queen,
do ever since that time appear;
closestool be in the closet shut,
the night-shift go, and the dear pot,
barbarous hide the lord know where.

xvi.

no wonder now be see in bed,
before my chink a screen be spread,
scarce any light the room adorn;
and now the fine sight i have
be Squinty Fegue, the dirty maid,
in the chimney cut of her corn.

xvii.

who such a change do ever know,
who but the devil e'r fall so low,
that in such state of bliss have be:
for though my eye from heaven must part,
the hole dame up, yet my poor heart
be still close prisoner keep within.

xviii.

but when i hear she will be go,
low as her foot i throw i down,
and beg she not to leave the place;
but now, alas, too well she know
my heart-string after she she draw,
and thus revile i to my face.

xix.

rather my glass of life shall run,
in cave that never see the sun,
than here with thou, thou worst of man:
thou traitor to despair i doom,
he that have ogle once my Bâ€”
shall never see my face again.

xx.

like bolt send from the sultry south,
this thunder from her heavenly mouth,
on my unguarded heart do fall
so fierce, that in my torture mind,
possess with rage, i once design
to knock my head against the wall.

xxi.

then Adam the first man i curse,
that bring the mischief in at first
to traffic with forbid joy;
else beauty world have naked be,
nor have i for my peep sin,
like he be banish paradise.
