                     <p>Invocation, ver. 1, 2, 3. — The excellence and lustre of David's character in twelve
                        points of view, ver. 4; proved from the history of his life, to ver. 17. — He consecrates
                        his genius for consolation and edification. — The subjects he made choice of — the
                        Supreme Being — angels; men of renown; the works of nature in all directions, either
                        particularly or collectively considered, to ver. 27. — He obtains power over infernal
                        spirits, and the malignity of his enemies; wins the heart of Michal, to ver. 30. —
                        Shews that the pillars of knowledge are the monuments of God's works in the first
                        week, to ver. 38. — An exercise upon the decalogue, from ver. 40 to 49. — The transcendent
                        virtue of praise and adoration, ver. 50 and 51. — An exercise upon the seasons, and
                        the right use of them, from ver. 52 to 64. — An exercise upon the senses, and how
                        to subdue them, from ver. 65 to 71. — An amplification in five degrees, which is wrought
                        up to this conclusion, That the best poet which ever lived was thought worthy of the
                        highest honour which possibly can be conceived, as <span class="hi">the Saviour of the world was ascribed to his house, and called his son in the body</span>.
