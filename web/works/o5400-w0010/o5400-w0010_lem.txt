Leucothoe.

act i 

oh! jealousy, thy torment who can bear?
forsake, scorn, abandon to despair!
i rage, i burn, no kind assistance nigh!
give, give i ease, you god, or let i die.

farewell, you stream! farewell, you grove!
farewell, you shady bower!
soft scene of blissful hour,
 of former conscious love.
farewell, sweet peace of mind!
fond wish, please pain,
 with all the tender train,
 the joy that happy lover find.
farewell! your halcyon day be over,
 and i must never know you more.

but, see! he come, the author of my woe:
 he come, ungrateful god; — but not to i.
another love within his bosom glow;
 another nymph! distract misery!
another nymph allure he to her arm.
i can bear the thought! confound her art,
 eternal lightning blast her charm,
 that rob i of the dear inconstant's heart.
goddess of dire revenge! may all her day
 to peace be stranger, and her night to rest;
 may hope never sooth she with imagine ease,
 nor patience still the tumult in her breast.
since she have steal possession of my joy,
 fulfil my prayer, by pity, justice, lead;
 may turn alike our happiness destroy,
 and all my grief be double on her head.

 "hail! to love, delicious boy,
"hail! to love, and welcome joy: "
love, the best, the only treasure,
 love, that laugh at proud degree,
 love, that render pain a pleasure,
 and by enslave make we free.

when heaven to woman beauty do dispense,
 it give away its own omnipotence.
high among the power above, enthrone i sit,
 i be style the god of wisdom, and of wit;
 this arm alone light fiery steed can rein.
oh force, how impotent! oh boast, how vain!
incapable to curb my own desire.
what be strength, or wisdom use, when love inspire?
unseen, resistless, it impel we on;
no force can tame it, nor can prescience shun,
and, ere we dread the danger, we be undo.

hah! whence this boldness? now who dare intrude
 upon my peaceful, sacred solitude?

Clytie, kneel. 

light of the world, great eye, and soul,
 view at your foot a suppliant maid;
 behold my tear, for you they roll,
 for you these sigh my breast invade.
ah! turn your face; ah! cease to chide;
 nor let, while my distress you see,
 what be warmth and life to all beside,
 be coldness, and be death to i.

Phoebus.

have i not tell you, Clytie, over and over,
 that we must meet upon these term no more?
why then persist you thus to haunt i still,
 and force i to be cruel against my will?

Clytie.

because i love, it be therefore i pursue.
oh need i say i love! you know i do.
that answer for i: love, in spite of fear,
 bring i to meet your dread resentment here,
 the resolution of my doom to know,
 and die, — if you, unkind, will have it so.

Phoebus.

leave i, and live.

Clytie.

inhuman! rather say,
 oh ten time rather, — Clytie, die, and stay.
to life with firmness i can bid adieu;
 but it be impossible to part from you.

Phoebus.

be go.

Clytie.

i can. — there be once a time,
 when such a word will have be think a crime.
oh change, how great! my person to behold,
 be i deform, or sudden grow old?
if ever i have charm your love to gain,
 methinks those charm their wonted bloom retain.
say then in what, in what be it i offend?
let i but know my fault, i will strive to mend.

Phoebus.

will you my languid appetite revive,
 and keep the just expire flame alive,
 mild and reserve you shall at distance stand,
 and gentle feed it with a cautious hand:
 what spare apply, renew desire;
 pour on, extinguish, and damp the fire.

give i the nymph who charm with ease,
 who great pleasure be to please;
 who passion never tyrannic grow,
 but hand in hand with freedom go;
 who never feel transport in her breast,
 but as she see her lover bless:
 it be such a nymph, and only she,
 must hope to gain a heart from i.

Clytie.

and can you then so soon those vow forget,
 which echo scarce have leave repeat yet?
those vow — to i for ever fatal day,
 when first they lead my easy faith astray!
which morn and eve have hear, thou base ingrate,
 and promise love immortal as your state?

think but how oft, unmindful of alarm,
 you have lie encircle by those yield arm,
 insatiate drain copious draught of bliss,
 and swear heaven be lodge in every kiss;
 and then when cloy with the delicious feast,
 and sink unnerved on this still pant breast,
 think now, repeat the dear task, you have die,
 yet curse the day that force you from my side.

Phoebus.

that once your beauty do my soul subdue,
 i frank tell you, and i tell you true.
i love, enjoy, and from enjoyment bless,
 think for a while my appetite increase;
 but grow with frequent iteration tire,
 at length i nauseate what i first desire.

Clytie.

i see you nauseate, even this moment see
 your eye regard i with antipathy.
nor think i stranger to the cause; i know
 what bring you, Phoebus, to this secret plain,
 for who my gentle bondage you forgo,
 and treat my love with insult and disdain.

Phoebus.

hah!

Clytie.

for LEUCOTHÖe. you start; that name
 have strike you. oh! more false than syren song,
 be it for this i sell myself to shame?
for this —

Phoebus.

be wise in time, and stop your tongue,
 another word be destruction sure as hell.
now harken, and take care to observe i well.
by that irrevocable oath i swear,
 which even god themselves with tremble take,
 by the eternal, gloomy flood, if ever
 you breathe again what you have presume to speak
 this instant, life shall expiate the offence.
reply not; make no answer: get you hence.

oh where, too charm, cruel maid,
 unmindful do thou rove?
why be my bliss thus long delay?
haste, haste thou quick to my aid,
 and tune my jar soul to love.

Clytie.

confusion! madness! hell! or yet what be worse!
oh give i breath sufficient to curse
 the world, myself — and all my feeble race.
what! boast your falsehood, own it to my face!
go, tyrant, seek the idol you adore,
 clytie weak claim shall trouble you no more:
 hence! stubborn weakness, hence! — o tender fool!
my heart yet fain will hold he, can it be:
 but tutor by example, i shall cool,
 and he disdain, as he have slight i.

no more let love with golden shaft be draw,
 or downy mantle wing;
 but arm his hand,
 with flame brand,
 and scorpion whip to sting,
 the wretch by his fell distemper gnaw.
no more a infant heaven-designed,
 but a grim monster, fierce and blind,
 the curse and scourge of human kind.

Phoebus.

infernal jealousy! thou foe to rest,
 despotic ruler in the female breast,
 of love beget, unnatural, and dire,
 thou prey upon the vital of thy fire.
but, see! she come, who no such pang excite,
 the harbinger of every dear delight;
 she come, like teem spring along the plain,
 youth, plenty, health, and pleasure, in her train.

so in some evening fair the feather male,
 expect his tuneful consort in the vale;
 at sight of she, his heart exult spring,
 he rear his plume, and beat his little wing:
 they meet, they nestle to each other breast,
 and side by side pursue their way to rest.

LEUCOTHÖE.

my lord! my life!

Phoebus.

my best, my tender part!
thus let i clasp you to my pant heart.
hence, you profane! each rude guest be far,
 the slave of business, and the son of war;
 let none within these happy shade be see,
 but such as wait upon the paphian queen,
 the sport, the pleasure, and the wing boy,
 foe to suspicion and domestic noise.
passion may doubt, and quarrel in decay,
 we still shall flourish — oh LEUCOTHÖE!

be ever creature form so fair!
sweet from every poor distil,
 such a shape, and such a air,
 lip so soft, and eye so kill.
turn, oh turn these humid fire!
i can bear their wound glance;
 they fill my soul with fierce desire,
 and plunge i in ecstatic trance.

LEUCOTHÖE.

oh! welcome to my soul, as after shower
 your own enliven beam to fruit and flower,
 welcome as cool wind to labour swain,
 or freedom to the wretch that groan in chain.
may this for ever, ever be my place,
 to live and die in thy adore embrace.

Phoebus.

oh thrill joy! oh more than charm she!
be ever deity caress like i?

LEUCOTHÖE.

oh height of bliss! oh great than divine!
be ever mortal happiness like i?

Phoebus.

how shall i speak the dictate of my heart!
no language can express, no action prove
my meeting joy.

LEUCOTHÖE.

my sorrow when we part!

Phoebus.

how tender i dote!

LEUCOTHÖE.

how much i love!

who upon the oozy beach,
 can count the numerous sand that lie?
or distinct reckon each
 transparent star that stud the sky?

as their multitude betray,
 and frustrate all attempt to tell,
 so it be impossible to say
 how much we love, we love so well.

Phoebus.

be hush, you wind, and you, you power, accord,
who own the force of my superior word.
hear, and obey! you deity that reign
over the green wood, or haunt the dusky plain;
hear, and obey! the soft form, that lave
in the cool font, or stem the lucid wave;
and you that roll the rapid orb on high.

LEUCOTHÖE.

what sound be these of melt melody,
which steal so soft and sweet upon my ear?

Phoebus.

hark! it be the music of the move sphere;

obedient to thy beauty, they advance
the harmonious measure of their tuneful dance.
nature exult, affect by my joy;
and, see! the sister, from their sacred height,
in concert mingle, all their art employ,
proud to administer to your delight.

LEUCOTHÖE.

methinks these scene, such wonder they inspire,
 i still can gaze upon, and still admire;
 yet for the present, prithee, let they cease,
 our revel may offend the neighbour peace:
 and shall they to my father ear be bring —
 my blood run cold, and curdle at the thought!

Phoebus.

causeless the thought, and premature the fear!
what can your father do when i be here?
he, and the extensive empire which he sway,
 strike by my word, shall vanish like a blaze.
come thou, poor tremble turtle, seek thy mate,
 and, safe beneath his pinion, laugh at fate.

Phoebus and LEUCOTHÖE.

hark! love summons we away;
 let we obey,
 come away;
 hark! love summons we away:
 just expire,
 with desire,
 take, oh! take i while you may,
 else i shall dissolve away.
stay my fleet soul with kiss,
 till we feed on fierce bliss,
 bliss god alone shall share.
oh! my life, my joy, my treasure,
 oh! the ecstasy, the pleasure;
 it be too much, too much to bear.

act ii.

LEUCOTHÖE.

the wind be fast asleep, there be scarce a breeze
 to rock the little bird upon the tree.
what grateful odour rise from every brake!
see how the moonbeam shine on yonder lake!
how soft sweet these water fall to ground,
 that break the silence with their murmur sound!
you will not, sure, so quick bid farewell;
 i have yet a thousand thing to ask, and tell.

Phoebus.

and i can ever stay to talk and hear;
 but look how faint those glimmer fire appear!
i must be go, by sad occasion press:
 the morning-star already light the east;
 Aurora now unbar the gate of day,
 and from that mountain summons i away.

LEUCOTHÖE.

yet stay. — i know i have somewhat to impart;
if you be absent long, it will break my heart.

how soon will you return?

Phoebus.

with double speed
i will lash my courser to their western bed
at night. — believe i to my promise just;
i will come on wing —

LEUCOTHÖE.

then must we part?

Phoebus.

we must,

but for a few short hour: restrain your tear;
why thus encompass with unusual fear?
you droop!

LEUCOTHÖE.

oh, Phoebus!

Phoebus.

say thou? prithee speak.

LEUCOTHÖE.

forgive i; i be a woman, fond, and weak,

in terror often when no danger nigh:
perhaps i weep, and fear, i know not why.

why with sigh my heart be swell,
 why with tear my eye overflow,
 ask i not, it be past the tell,
 mute, involuntary woe.
prize joy, we fear to lose they;
 can you then condemn my pain?
something whisper to my bosom,
 we shall never meet again.

Phoebus.

oh! my dear love, quick, quick drive away
 those bode thought which on your quiet prey;
 the breed of fancy, gender in the brain,
 nurse by the gross spirit, light, and vain;
 the vagrant vision of the sleep mind,
 which vanish wake, nor leave a mark behind.

when two kind dove their nest desert,
a different passage to pursue,
with gentle murmur thus they part.

LEUCOTHÖE.

my life, farewell!

Phoebus.

my love, adieu!

LEUCOTHÖE.

he be go, and leave i: hah! what mean this dread?
save i! a sword hang hover over my head.
the earth yawn to swallow i: i sink, oh fate!
alas! i be fright with my own conceit:
 nor sword, nor yawn earth, be here, and now
 a lazy languor creep along my vein;
 dull, and more dull my heavy eyelid grow,
 and every sense accept the leaden chain.

oh, god of sleep! arise, and spread
 thy heal vapour round my head;
 to thy friendly mansion take,
 my soul that burn,
 till he return,
 for who alone i wish to wake.
there yield my thought their favourite theme,
 and bring my lover in a dream.

slave.

why stand you thus bemuse, in silence lose?
fiend-struck you seem, or fright by some ghost.
alas! she hear i not; within her mind,
as war flame be in the earth confine,

so be her rage and indignation pen.
dear mistress!

Clytie.

oh!

slave.

there give your passion vent.
behold of love the so much boast bliss!

Clytie.

why be i bear, you god, since doom to this?

off, idle ornament, detest glare
of gold and jewel, wherefore be you here?
why be i dress in pompous robe like these?
there be no one now who i will wish to please.
let then my soul and body be akin,
naked without, as desolate within.
by various passion be i tear,
now with anger, now with scorn;
now with fear my heart recoil,
now with rage my spirit boil:
as the different plague infest,
to love or vengeance i incline;
now i can stab his faithless breast,
now — press he close to i.

slave.

assuage your transport, you augment the ill
 by nourish those thought you ought to kill.

Clytie.

hence, paltry babbler! when the loud wind sweep,
 command the nile impetu'us surge to sleep;
 when burn Aetna rage, bid it cease;
 go sooth the torture of the damn to peace:
 their sieve, their stone, their vulture, and their wheel,
 be light, be nothing, to the pang i feel.

slave.

take comfort.

Clytie.

yes; it be fix, i will die this hour;
that be all the comfort now within my power:
a dagger end at once my life and care.

slave.

oh! toss on sea of ruinous despair!

yet hear i ever you split upon this shelf;
revenge on those who wrong you — not yourself.

Clytie.

revenge on who? a god!

slave.

the best revenge.
pay falsehood back with falsehood, change for change,

try soft heart, exert your charm, and show,
indifferent, as he leave, you let he go.

when unpitied we languish,
 and sigh for a swain,
 who feel not our anguish,
 but laugh at our pain,
 in vain we pursue his untractable mind,
 with whine,
 and cry,
 and wish,
 and die;
 then scorn the perplexer, and look out to find
 another as lovely — another more kind.

Clytie.

be this the mighty vengeance you propose,
this the kind comfort then you yield my woe?
to sue to other, and from they obtain,
what all my love deserve from he in vain.

return I have have — how sweet!

slave.

how quick past!
better never taste, since they can not last.

Clytie.

and shall i turn a beggar with my charm?
the thought with double strength my fury arm,

no! thus at once my farther pang i save —

slave.

behold upon her knee your faithful slave!
oh! let my tear, my service, prevail;
we have mean of great revenge, which can fail.

Clytie.

avaunt!

slave.

oh! hear i.

Clytie.

yet again! beware,
nor tempt the fury of my rage too far.
come, thou last, only friend, thy work pursue.

slave.

by all my hope of happiness, it be true;
the object of your jealousy shall die!

Clytie, pause from the stroke. 

go on.

slave.

first lie that dreadful weapon by:
i can speak, your look my word appal.

Clytie, throw away the dagger. 

say thou not she, the accurse she, shall fall?
you hold my arm, or she, ere this, have lie
dead at my foot.

slave.

and she shall still be slay,
but not by you; the god already cold,
what then shall gain his love, his vengeance hold?

Clytie.

speak quick the mean; my soul have take alarm,
 and all my flutter sense round i arm.
oh give i poison, rack, consume fire,
 swift as my rage, and wild as my desire.

slave.

nor poison, rack, nor fire, we need to wait,
 the king, her father, be our mean of fate:
 to he unfold in secret all you know,
 you point the weapon, but he strike the blow.

Clytie.

i will do it; — each moment be a year delay:
 it be clear, it be obvious as the noontide-day;
 by passion blind, by despair mislead,
 i walk in cloud. — she be already dead!
my rival doom! i see she on the ground!
i hear her groan! — there be music in the sound.

slave.

look where in shade those myrtle-branche throng,
 the king appear, and this way move along;
 the time, the occasion, both conspire to bless
 your great design, and crown it with success.

Clytie.

what sudden tremor seize upon my heart!
cold dewy damp from every poor perspire!
no matter — injure love, perform thy part,
 the consequence be what it may. — retire.

Clytie.

hence, weak remorse! hence, hence away!
in vain before my dazzle eye,
 in all your daunt shape you rise,
 to fill i with dismay.
your check i defy,
 my rival shall die;
 and thou, who false, ungrateful heart
 thy immortality secure,
 look down, while i revenge my smart,
 and through her bosom strike at you.

ORCHAMUS.

hail! roseate dawn, at who approach light,
 spectre and bird ill-omened take their flight;
 thou, at who rise shame seek cimmerian shade,
 and lust and murder hide their horrid head;
 hope spring aloft, the mist of grief exhale,
 and life and joy renew their course — all hail!

Clytie, kneel. 

may the king live for ever!

ORCHAMUS.

rise, bright maid;
 thou shall not pay obeisance, but be pay:
 abroad thus early have you make your way,
 to add new charm to, or outshine the day?

Clytie.

to view the infant morning at its birth,
 as first it rise upon the darken earth,
 when great Jove utter the creative word,
 and nature all alive obey her lord;
 to hear the bird, observe the wake flower,
 and wonder at heaven work, adore its power.

ORCHAMUS.

exalt wisdom! from those lip it break!
be it a angel, or fair Clytie speak?

how much superior beauty awe,
 the cold bosom find;
 but with resistless force it draw,
 to sense and virtue join.
the casket where to outward show
 the artist hand be see,
 be double value, when we know
 it hold a gem within.

Clytie, aside. 

now tremble, you inconstants, wheresoever,
 who cheat with fraudful vow unwary fair:
 fate be at work — love sit on justice' throne,
 and hasten to chastise you all in one.

ORCHAMUS.

what will thou? speak. but now, there something spring
 warm from your heart, which freeze upon your tongue.
give it free air — lay chill fear aside,
 and on a monarch faith and power confide.

Clytie.

yet why shall friendship force i to reveal,
 and tell he that which pity shall conceal!

ORCHAMUS.

whatever you will demand, my grant ensue;
 when beauty ask, can ORCHAMUS refuse?
say, then, what thought so cruel to molest
 the peaceful tenor of that gentle breast?

Clytie.

ask not the subject of my thought, which know,
 perhaps may spoil the quiet of your own.

ORCHAMUS.

virtue unmoved the thunderer voice can hear;
 to guilt a stranger, we be unknown to fear.

Clytie.

ay, but some ill there be of such a kind,
 so black, so dreadful, even the virtuous mind
 can support their shock, which leave a sting
 like vice behind. — oh ill requite king!
think, be there nothing can affect you more,
 than loss of state, dominion, wealth, and power?

ORCHAMUS.

you deal in riddle!

Clytie.

dreadful to expound!
oh! be my tongue to silence ever bind!
drive, drive i from you to the farther pole —

ORCHAMUS.

you mean to stagger my determine soul!

Clytie.

your daughter!

ORCHAMUS.

what of she? i shake all over!

Clytie.

yet send i hence in time, and seek no more.
farewell!

ORCHAMUS.

return, i charge you; haste, come back:
you will not leave i thus upon the rack.
say, be my daughter dead? — i think i can —
at least i will try — to bear it like a man.

Clytie.

be that the worst, how easy to be say,
for what be the loss of life? her honour be dead.
her virtue!

ORCHAMUS ..

hah, beware!

Clytie.

but now these eye
 behold they revel in their guilty joy;
 even here they part as you seek the place.
i can have stab they in their last embrace.

ORCHAMUS.

o name the traitor, that he soon may bleed!

Clytie.

the god you worship, sir, have do the deed:
the glorious sun, inspire with lustful flame,
have pay your incense with your daughter shame.

ORCHAMUS.

it be well! — oh king, your boast power how small!
where, when do he? damnation! tell i all.

Clytie.

at a silent, secret hour,
 soft steal to her bower,
 there he find the lovesick maid,
 wish, warm, and unarray;
 fire with the charm sight,
 soon begin the amorous fight!
their pulse beat high to love alarm;
 he strive — and triumph over her charm.

ORCHAMUS.

what be to be do? confusion! shame! and death!
this hand shall stop the wanton strumpet breath.
i give she be — how then shall i take
 that being from she? — ORCHAMUS, awake!
it be dream, chimera all — imperfect, wild,
 justice command i to destroy — my child!

at once a father, and a judge,
 how shall i bid she die or live?
there one severe will condemn,
 the other tender forgive.

Clytie, aside. 

what a rough war contend passion keep!
now the storm up; now, hah! by heaven he weep.
oh may these drop, like those which fall from high,
 before the rapid thunder rend the sky,
 be the forerunner of approach wrath,
 and bode destruction, peril, rage, and death.

ORCHAMUS.

you fury that howl in the abyss profound,
 hither, hither repair,
 from the wild of despair,
 and encompass i round;
 each a torch in her hand,
 take your terrible stand!
from my breast keep all motion of pity away;
 and when nature speak,
 in your yell and shriek
 drown her soften plea.
what honour demand, it be our duty to give;
 who merit to die, shall we suffer to live?

Clytie.

oh glorious hear! oh triumphant day!
thus great nemesis, thus my thanks i pay:
 now, now, false god, your recompense receive,
 and in your turn confess the pang you give.
fly, care, to the wind,
 my fate have be kind;
 oh! pleasure,
 past measure,
 transcendent great;
 no more i complain
 of ungrateful disdain,
 if i suffer in love, i triumph in hate.

act iii.

a man.

behold, my friend, behold the dismal scene,
 where never summer tread, nor spring serene,
 but everlasting winter lower over,
 deform the bleak, uncomfortable shore.

a woman.

here, where the wild beast lurk in his den,
 avoid the haunt of no less savage man;
 among these rock the horrid cavern lie,
 doom to receive the royal sacrifice.

chorus.

oh dreadful sentence! unrelenting fate!
mourn, all you son of prostrate Persia, mourn;
 from hence let sorrow take a endless date,
 tear follow tear, and sigh to sigh return;
 in a eternal course of pierce woe,
 such as from shame, despair, and grief, shall flow.

a man and a woman.

a nymph adorn with every grace,
 so soft a form, so fair a face,
 with Venus she may vie:
 like some sweet flower, untimely crop!
ah, must she fade! ah, must she drop!
ah! must she, must she die?

a man.

soft! break you quick off! west over the beach,
 far as the eye its pierce beam can stretch:
 lo! where the victim, 'midst a mournful throng,
 in solemn, slow procession, move along.

a woman.

she come a live coarse; what eye but weep
 at the sad spectacle? — now, sun eclipse!
at once the lover and the god assume,
 and snatch she tremble from the untimely tomb.

prepare! prepare! prepare!

LEUCOTHÖE,

oh, mighty god! that guide the day,
 a moment stop your rapid way;
 behold i in this dreadful strife,
 just totter on the brink of life,
 no help, no friendly comfort nigh,
 to break my fall,
 beset with all
 the terror of eternity;
 while doubt and fear
 my bosom tear,
 and with alternate passion vie;
 think when you see,
 and pity i;
 oh! think it be for you i die.

a youth.

thy charm just rise to their noon,
 ah! must we see they set so soon?

a virgin.

those charm which distant prince woo,
 and deity themselves pursue!

a youth.

what heart that be not freeze quite,
but must in thy affliction share?

a virgin.

to see, oh melancholy sight!
to see you plunge in sudden night!

a youth.

to be you know not what!

a virgin.

to go you know not where!

LEUCOTHÖE.

weep not, my dear companion!

chorus of youth and virgin.

cruel stroke!
can nothing then thy destiny revoke?

LEUCOTHÖE.

no! we must part; even now fate lift the sheer,
 to cut the thread of my scarce half-spun year.
farewell! when poor leucothöe forget,
 oh! may you find a more indulgent lot.
may each be happy in some nymph or youth,
 proud to repay your tenderness and truth.
then, if between the transport of your bliss,
 you shall recount a piteous tale like this,
 of some poor creature by her love betray,
 as the sad accident your memory strike,
 bestow a tear in pity to my shade,
 and mourn at once two fate so much alike.

youth and virgin.

come, sorrow, from thy gloomy cell,
 where in eternal rage you dwell;
 from thy bed of raven plume,
 curtain round with dusky fume.

chorus.

come, and with you bring your groan,
 frantic gesture, sullen moan,
 fury of conflict passion,
 sigh, and tear, and lamentation,
 join with we in doleful lay,
 rage and death triumph today.

ORCHAMUS.

hold yet a moment! ere the impervious skreen,
 which sever world from world, be draw between;
 ere yet i be of all my hope beguile,
 let i once more embrace my wretched child;
 the judge, the sovereign, have their part supply,
 and now the parent will be satisfy.

LEUCOTHÖE.

my father! oh be quick to drive i down.
gape wide, you rock, and save i from his frown!

ORCHAMUS.

be not of thy fond father frown afraid,
 nor think he come thy folly to upbraid;
 no, rather to these sad proceed loath,
 he come to mourn the cause which ruin both;
 that rigid honour, who stern voice demand
 thy forfeit life at his unwilling hand.

LEUCOTHÖE.

to death, without repine, i submit,
 as to a thing which heaven and you think fit;
 whatever have be my crime, while yet i live,
 let i but hear you pity and forgive.

ORCHAMUS.

forgive you! pity you! oh that i do,
 these tear be witness which my cheek bedew.
will any thing but death may purge our line
 from your offence, or any death but thy;
 for with thou all my joy will take their leave,
 and i shall walk in sorrow to the grave.

LEUCOTHÖE.

stop! stop! those sacred shower, they must not fall
 for i; i now indeed be criminal.

ORCHAMUS.

the mother-hind,
 distract in mind,
 her young one make the hunter prey;
 wide over the lawn,
 from rosy dawn
 to dewy evening take her way;
 till quite overcome,
 with fruitless pain,
 weary at length she lay she down,
 in sad despair,
 and fill the plain
 all night with miserable moan.

it be thus, when thou be go, thy sire shall be;
 so shall he wish by day, so mourn at night, for thou.

LEUCOTHÖE.

behold thus low, your wretched, indiscreet,
 unhappy daughter, cast she at your foot.
oh! wherefore do not my frail being end,
 ere i have power such goodness to offend?
before my crime have stain my royal race,
 or draw a tear along that sacred face.

ORCHAMUS.

good heaven and earth! turn; nature, turn aside;
 turn, nor behold this pious parricide,
 lest, blind to chance, and ignorant of the cause,
 you think mankind, like i, have leave your law.

farewell! the time call on we, we must part.
this last embrace — down, down, my swell heart.

LEUCOTHÖE.

look on i.

ORCHAMUS.

you there who attend the rite,
haste to perform the farther requisite.
nature, lie still!

LEUCOTHÖE.

i come — oh why, my blood,
 why run thou to my heart a freeze flood?
why tremble thou, my flesh? limb yet awhile
 support i — but a few short moment past,
 dissolve death shall free you from your toil,
 and give you up to everlasting rest.

thou dark abyss! who womb obscene
 be fraught with every mortal pain,
 who horrid jaw, in dread display,
 gape to devour i — take your prey!
receive i, yet the vital lamp,
 all burn with spiritu'us fire,
 among thy raw, unwholesome damp,
 unseen, unpitied, to expire.

ORCHAMUS.

stay! yet again forbear — a instant hold!
you god, regard i, i be infirm, and old;
a load of grief unable to sustain!
let not the weak and suppliant beg in vain.
if with mistaken piety i rate
 this crime, if justice ask not what i give,
 arrest the uplift arm of vengeful fate;
 appear! and bid the destine victim live.

chorus.

your blissful mansion leave!
appear! and save!

strophe.

the power be silent to our prayer.

anti-strophe.

nor sign of mercy show.

strophe.

who heaven condemn, shall mortal spare?

srophe, anti-strophe.

no! no! no!

ORCHAMUS.

you solid pole, give way; you sky, roll back;
 earth, from your deep foundation, be disjoin:
 burst nature round i in a general wrack,
 all horrible confusion, like my mind!

oh i! unhappy father, where,
 where shall i go to seek relief?
every object, every place,
 tend my sorrow to increase;
 not one to blot away my care,
 not one to cure my grief.

Clytie.

oh! be you find, sir? what be it you have do,
 to raise the anger of the immortal sun?
speak quick; answer i, without delay:
 where be your daughter? where be LEUCOTHÖE?

ORCHAMUS.

i prithee ask i not; my heart-vein bleed
 each time i think of it. — oh! where indeed?
where but — dread consequence of jealous spleen!
for thy officiousness she never have be.

Clytie.

for my officiousness! what, then you will make
 i partner of your guilt! — perdition take
 the execrable purpose! — i disclaim
 whatever you have do. look to it, the blame
 on your own head. — but, hark! it come apace!
the thunder come! — fly, instant fly this place!
will you their safety, or your own, consult?
for my part, i shall stay to meet the bolt.

Phoebus, entere. 

oh most accurse king! inhuman sire!
my life! my love! my only heart desire!
LEUCOTHÖE! oh murder! — hence, away
 like lightning: help she ere it be yet too late.
if there be a spark of life unquenched, we may
 redeem she still, and snatch her soul from fate

Clytie, kneel. 

oh, Phoebus! hither turn your angry eye!
what! go without a word!

slave.

dear lady, rise:
think where you be —

Clytie.

go he not frown too?
what sudden horror rush upon my view!
what desolate coast be this we tread,
 so like the dreary nation of the dead?
thus wretched Ariadne, leave behind,
 weep on the shore of Argos, bleak and bare;
 while cruel Theseus flee before the wind,
 nor listen to the voice of her despair.

slave.

Laid she on gentle.

Clytie.

stay you yet awhile;
my brain on fire, my blood begin to boil:
what do you hold i for? — stand off.

slave.

alas!
what still i have fear — at length be come to pass.
her sense be disturb.

Clytie.

what noise be that?
Jove talk — all the god be in debate
upon my future welfare. — hark! hark! hark!
not a word more — it be grow exceed dark:
see cloud on cloud above each other rise,
in sable mountain, to obscure the sky.
it be do! where be i? let i grope my way
again through this black passage into day.

ah, wretch! bewilder wretch!
in vain my arm i stretch,
 in vain i feel about:
 will no kind star afford its light,
 to guide my err step aright?
no friendly hand hold out,
 conduct i through this gloom of night!

slave.

patience! sweet patience! all shall yet go well.

Clytie.

at length the vapour gradu'l dispel;
sure it be the dawn, from yonder point it break,
brighten the front of heaven with rosy streak.
there leap the eternal courser with a bind
from the green flood — and now it be light around.
lo! where aloft immortal Phoebus stand,
graceful the reins, depend from his hand:
he look, he smile, he beckon i from far;
i run, i fly, i mount the fiery car.
oh! triumph, triumph, seat by his side,
sublime in splendour, through the air i ride.

we come! we come!
make room! make room!
now climb heaven stupendous steep,
 we view the empyrean height;
 now over the smooth meridian sweep,
 the earth below too small for sight;
 now down the blue concave descend again,
 impetu'us we drive to the western main:
 while at every crash,
 of the thunder lash,
 as we whirl along, the zodiac round
 reply to the stroke, and echo the sound.
bless i! oh, how be i oppress?
soft, lay i gentle down to rest.

chorus.

her wit return; you power! restore,
 and yield she to herself once more.

Clytie, the slave lay she on the ground. 

at some tall mountain hoary foot,
 with shelve rock and tree overhang,
 who head incessant tempest beat,
 and raven pester all day long;
 let i — where slow meander steer
 its course, upon the bank recline,
 augment the water with my tear,
 and with my sigh increase the wind.

Phoebus.

desist, desist; your pain be fruitless all,
 the vital spirit flee beyond recall,
 sink to those shade from whence it never must rise,
 from whence grim Pluto never yield a prize.
inexorable power! — oh might we mix
 even here, content from heaven i will remove,
 upon thy ruthless sepulchre to fix
 a monument of wretchedness and love.

one of the Horae.

far be such sorrow from the god of day,
 who next to Jove bear universal sway;
 suppose your mistress dead, exert your power,
 she still may glide a stream, expand a flower;
 or rise stately in the sylvan scene,
 stretch forth a leafy umbrage over the green.

Phoebus.

it shall be so; yes, dear unhappy maid,
 since thy sad lover can no farther aid:
 since stubborn death deny to loose his hold,
 and yield thy beauty in their proper mould,
 thus i pronounce — grow fruitful, sterile grave!
and strait do thou thy former species leave.
exist — though not as thou be wont to be;
 no more a woman, flourish in a tree!
so shall thy body change, as heretofore,
 teach deity to bend, and mortal to adore.

chorus.

what sudden fragrance fill the air!
lo! the bloom shoot appear!
parent earth,
 assist the birth,
 so shall her body, change as heretofore,
 teach deity to bend, and mortal to adore.

Phoebus.

thrice sacred plant!
thus heaven thy favour growth endow;
 a spicy scent
 spring ever from thy teem bough,
 while round thy root rich unguent flow.
the tear you shed,
 to god a grateful sacrifice,
 on altar lay,
 in aromatic smoke shall rise,
 and plead for mortal with the sky.

Clytie start up, catch hold of his robe. 

by the breeze that pass sigh,
 by the rock that round we rise;
 by the star that dim glow,
 witness of my present woe;
 by the mountain, by the wood,
 by the grotto, by the flood,
 by the dear transport night,
 witness of our past delight:
 for love — for former friendship sake,
 i charge you stay — and hear i speak.

Phoebus.

unhand i!

Clytie.

mercy!

Phoebus.

fury, let i go!
or —

Clytie.

never, never will i loose you. — oh
grant i a little strength! — do break my hand!
destroy i! dash i on those flinty sand!
yet still persist will i hold you fast,
and, strive to embrace you, breathe my last.

Phoebus, drag she out of sight. 

nay, then!

Clytie.

o stay — kind Venus, help afford!
here let i grow a statue!

Phoebus, return. 

at your word
i take you. — be the thing that you desire,
a dread example of immortal ire:
fix to that spot, remain to future time,
a instance of my vengeance, and your crime.

Clytie, behind the rock. 

what! — what be this i feel? — i be bind,
 my foot be root to the ground.
a sudden stupor over i come,
 that every faculty benumb;
 cold, cold, i freeze!
my blood congeal,
 my eye-sight fail,
 death invade i by degree.
i stiffen upward — cruel — so!
my heart — my voice — help — help i — oh!

Phoebus.

it be thus i have revenge, in one just hour,
my injure love, and my offend power.
expose that wretch!
such ever be the end
of those rash mortal who with god contend.
but first to finish what there yet remain!
thou horrid prospect of dry, sandy plain,
unfit, all rueful as you now appear,
to nurse the precious relique of my dear,
smooth your rough face — with instant verdure crown,
let smile spring encompass you around;
while we in decent sorrow mourn the dead,
and with due rite appease her injure shade.

chorus.

enough! enough! your game give over,
 the well-pleased ghost demand no more:
 deep in the covert of the grove,
 where helpless lover joy to rove,
 secure she rest, nor farther heed
 the weak effect of earthly deed.
