To a Gentleman, who shew'd a fine Poem as his own.

No more at Criticks, Ned, repine,
 Who say those Numbers are not thine. 
I own I was suspicious too,
 And thought the Verse too good for You:
 But since you say those Lines you writ,
 The Proof is full, and I submit. 

So, if Thaumantia should profess,
 She owes Herself her glorious Dress;
 And Cynthia, Empress of the Night,
 Declare she shines by native Light;
 (Tho' envious Criticks vent their Gall,)
 I'd equally believe you all.
