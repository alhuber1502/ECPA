to a gentleman, who show a fine poem as his own.

no more at critic, Ned, repine,
 who say those number be not thy. 
i own i be suspicious too,
 and think the verse too good for you:
 but since you say those line you write,
 the proof be full, and i submit. 

so, if thaumantia shall profess,
 she owe herself her glorious dress;
 and Cynthia, empress of the night,
 declare she shine by native light;
 (though envious critic vent their Gall,)
 i will equal believe you all.
