song.

come, let we dance and sing,
 while our spirit light wing;
 youth gay fantastic spring
 wreathe the mystic bower! 
bend here thy quiver foot,
 fancy thy smile shall greet,
 dimple amid rose sweet,
 and fruit with glow flower! 
glide along,
 join my song,
 meet i in the vary throng;
 crown with may,
 laugh gay,
 hail like a lark the day! 
thus the sweet spring we taste,
 ere our genial warmth shall waste,
 with nature blessing grace,
 we sport the hour away. 

life a uncertain joy,
 let we the rosy hour employ;
 ere they our power destroy
 they shall scatter charm:
 grey dawn shall see they rise,
 silver the open sky,
 sparkle with dewy eye,
 and blush spread their arm. 
trip gay,
 they burst with day,
 blaze with a gaudy ray;
'midst the bower
 bloom flower
 open, hail the noontide hour. 
then glide down the hill,
 silent eve its dew distil,
 with rapture each bosom thrill:
 night songstress music pour. 

deep then their blush appear,
amid their saffron-tinged hair,
 wave over the rise star,
 dissolve into night. 
Borne next on cynthia horn,
 glitter amid the lake and lawn,
 elf, spright, and sylvan fawn,
 dance in vapour dight:
 nightly beam,
 northern gleam,
 magic fire through ether stream;
 round the sky
 the hour fly,
 launch to eternity! 
thus ever on the wing,
 come, let we dance and sing,
 trample on sorrow sting,
 laugh at each sigh.
