song.

the season come when first we meet,
 but you return no more;
 why can i the day forget,
 which time can never restore? 
o day too sweet, too bright to last,
 be you indeed for ever past? 

the fleet shadow of delight,
 in memory i trace;
 in fancy stop their rapid flight,
 and all the past replace:
 but, ah, i wake to endless woe,
 and tear the fade vision close!
