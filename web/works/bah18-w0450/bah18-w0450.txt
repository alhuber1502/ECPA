SONG.

THE season comes when first we met,
 But you return no more;
 Why cannot I the days forget,
 Which time can ne'er restore? 
O days too sweet, too bright to last,
 Are you indeed for ever past? 

The fleeting shadows of delight,
 In memory I trace;
 In fancy stop their rapid flight,
 And all the past replace:
 But, ah, I wake to endless woes,
 And tears the fading visions close!
