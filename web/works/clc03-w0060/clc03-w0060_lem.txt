song. 

1. 

why Damon, why, why, why so press?
the heart you beg' not worth possess:
each look, each word, each smile affect,
and inward charm be quite neglect:
then scorn she, scorn she, foolish Swain,
and sigh no more, no more in vain.

2. 

beauty worthless, fade, fly;
who will for trifle think of die?
who for a face, a shape, will languish,
and tell the brook, and groves his anguish,
till she, till she think fit to prize he,
and all, and all beside despise he?

3. 

fix, fix you thought on what be invite,
on what will never bear the slight:
wit and virtue claim your duty,
they be much more worth than gold and beauty:
to they, to they, your heart resign,
and you will no more, no more repine.
