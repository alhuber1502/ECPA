doubt and fear suppress.

psalm iii.

i 

look, gracious god, how numerous they
 who envious power and rage
 conspire my eternal death
 against my soul engage. 

ii.

the lie tempter will persuade
 there be no relief in heaven;
 and all my swell sin appear
 too big to be forgive. 

iii.

but god my glory and my strength
 shall tread the tempter down,
 and drown my sin beneath the blood
 of his dear die son. 

iv.

i cry, and from his sacred hill
 he bow a listen ear;
 i call my father and my god,
 and he disperse my fear. 

v. 

he throw soft slumber on my eye
 in sight of all my foe,
 i awake, and wonder at the grace
 that guard my repose. 

vi.

what, though the host of death and hell
 all arm against i stand,
 terror no more shall shake my soul,
 nor tremble chill my blood. 

vii.

lord, i adore thy wondrous love,
 and thy salvation sing:
 my god have break the serpent tooth,
 and death have lose his sting. 

viii.

salvation to the lord belong,
 the lord alone can save;
 blessing attend thy people here,
 and reach beyond the grave.
