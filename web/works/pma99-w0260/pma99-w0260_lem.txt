hymn.

may peace and love from god above
 my bosom ever fill,
 so shall i find a humble mind
 obedient to his will. 

may faith and trust, and all that be just,
 my soul with ardour fire,
 i seek not wealth, i ask but health,
 nor more will i desire. 

may thanks and praise, throughout my day,
 my heart and mind employ,
 so shall i know, while here below,
 more than a earthly joy.
