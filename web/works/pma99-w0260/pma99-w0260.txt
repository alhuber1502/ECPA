HYMN.

May peace and love from God above
 My bosom ever fill,
 So shall I find an humble mind
 Obedient to his will. 

May faith and trust, and all that's just,
 My soul with ardour fire,
 I seek not wealth, I ask but health,
 Nor more would I desire. 

May thanks and praise, throughout my days,
 My heart and mind employ,
 So shall I know, whilst here below,
 More than an earthly joy.
