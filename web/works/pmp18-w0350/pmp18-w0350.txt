The Question, to Lisetta.

What Nymph shou'd I admire, or trust,
 But Cloe Beauteous, Cloe Just? 
What Nymph should I desire to see,
 But Her who leaves the Plain for Me? 
To Whom shou'd I compose the Lay,
 But Her who listens, when I play? 
To Whom in Song repeat my Cares,
 But Her who in my Sorrow shares? 
For Whom should I the Garland make,
 But Her who joys the Gift to take,
 And boasts She wears it for My Sake? 
In Love am I not fully blest? 
Lisetta, pr'ythee tell the rest.
