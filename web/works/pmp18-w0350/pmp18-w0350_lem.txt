the question, to Lisetta.

what nymph shall i admire, or trust,
 but cloe beauteous, cloe just? 
what nymph shall i desire to see,
 but she who leave the plain for i? 
to who shall i compose the lay,
 but she who listen, when i play? 
to who in song repeat my care,
 but she who in my sorrow share? 
for who shall i the garland make,
 but she who joy the gift to take,
 and boast she wear it for my sake? 
in love be i not full bless? 
Lisetta, prithee tell the rest.
