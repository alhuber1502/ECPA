to mr. *****

unused to every soothe sound,
 inure to every sorrow;
 to day you vain bind the wound
 that bleed afresh tomorrow. 

the world behold with careless eye,
 and much i scorn their pity;
 unseen, to heave the burst sigh,
 i leave the crowd city. 

and do thou ask my falter tongue,
 to tell a tale of woe? 
the grief my youthful breast have wring
 oh! may thou never know! 

long have i bear a orphan name,
 and share a orphan fate;
 few friend i have, or dare to claim,
 such be my helpless state. 

the simple dictate of my heart
 to public view they force;
 not pride, but pain do this impart;
 it be my last resource.
