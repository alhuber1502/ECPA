to sir Godfrey Kneller, on his picture of the king.

Kneller, with silence and surprise
 we see britannia monarch rise,
 a godlike form, by thou display
 in all the force of light and shade;
 and, I will by thy delusive hand,
 as in the presence-chamber stand. 

the magic of thy art call forth
 his secret soul and hide worth,
 his probity and mildness show,
 his care of friend, and scorn of foe:
 in every stroke, in every line,
 do some exalt vertue shine,
 and albion happiness we trace
 through all the feature of his face. 

o may i live to hail the day,
 when the glad nation shall survey
 their sovereign, through his wide command,
 pass in progress over the land! 
each heart shall bend, and every voice
 in loud applaud shout rejoice,
 while all his gracious aspect praise,
 and crowd grow loyal as they gaze. 

this image on the medal place,
 with its bright round of title grace,
 and stamp on british coin shall live;
 to rich oar the value give,
 or, wrought within the curious mould,
 shape and adorn the run gold. 
to bear this form, the genial sun
 have daily, since his course begin,
 rejoice the metal to refine,
 and ripen the Peruvian i. 

thou, Kneller, long with noble pride
 (the foremost of thy art) ha'st vie
 with nature in a generous strife,
 and touch the canvas into life. 
thy pencil have, by monarch seek,
 from reign to reign in ermine wrought,
 and, in their robe of state array,
 the king of half a age display. 

here swarthy Charles appear, and there
 his brother with deject air;
 triumphant Nassau here we find,
 and with he bright Maria join;
 there Anna, great as when she send
 her army through the continent,
 ever yet her hero be disgrace:
 o may fame Brunswick be the last,
 (though heaven shall with my wish agree,
 and long preserve thy art in thou)
 the last, the happy british king,
 who thou shall paint, or i shall sing! 

wise Phidias, thus his skill to prove,
 through many a god advance to Jove,
 and teach the polish rock to shine
 with air and lineament divine;
 till Greece, amaze, and half-afraid,
 the assemble deity survey. 

great Pan, who wont to chase the fair,
 and love the spread oak, be there;
 old Saturn too with upcast eye
 behold his abdicate sky;
 and mighty Mars, for war renowned,
 in adamantine armour frown;
 by he the childless goddess rise,
 Minerva, studious to compose
 her twist thread; the Webb she string,
 and over a loom of marble hang:
 Thetis the trouble ocean queen,
 match with a mortal, next be see
 (recline on a funeral urn)
 her short-lived darling son to mourn. 
the last be he, who thunder slay
 the titan-race, a rebel crew,
 that from a hundred hill, ally
 in impious league, their king defy. 

this wonder of the sculptor hand
 produce, his art be at a stand:
 for who will hope new fame to raise,
 or risque his well-established praise,
 that, his high genius to approve,
 have draw a GEORGE, or carve a Jove!
