ADAM Pos'd.

COu'd our First Father, at his toilsome Plough,
 Thorns in his Path, and Labour on his Brow,
 Cloath'd only in a rude, unpolish'd Skin,
 Cou'd he a vain Fantastick Nymph have seen,
 In all her Airs, in all her antick Graces,
 Her various Fashions, and more various Faces;
 How had it pos'd that Skill, which late assign'd
 Just Appellations to Each several Kind! 
A right Idea of the Sight to frame;
 T'have guest from what New Element she came;
 T'have hit the wav'ring Form, or giv'n this Thing a Name.
