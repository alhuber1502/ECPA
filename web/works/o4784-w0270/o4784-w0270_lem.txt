ADAM pose.

can our first father, at his toilsome plough,
 thorn in his path, and labour on his brow,
 clothe only in a rude, unpolished skin,
 can he a vain fantastic nymph have see,
 in all her air, in all her antic grace,
 her various fashion, and more various face;
 how have it pose that skill, which late assign
 just appellation to each several kind! 
a right idea of the sight to frame;
 to-have guest from what new element she come;
 to-have hit the waver form, or give this thing a name.
