to N. Tate, ESQ; on his poem on the queen picture, draw by closterman. 

hail mighty poet, mighty painter too,
 since to thy stroke, his equal line we owe;
 the sister art, be now a mystery
 and painture here, have bring forth poetry. 
the inspire shade, seem life itself refine,
 and all heaven goodness copy in her mind;
 so just each perform his nice part,
 as speak their skill, yet beauty without art:
 the emmulative ink, bright as the paint,
 this show the queen and that describe the saint. 
we prize in other still the last soul,
 but you have here, immortalise the whole:
 speak great Apollo thou alone can tell,
 whether the pencil or the pen excel. 

bribe by the native ardour of my breast,
 my muse no long will their worth contest:
 but must to Tate yeild the superior crown,
 who have complete closterman renown,
 and in his praise reverberate his own. 
but oh! what trophy of immortal fame,
 be just raise to sacred anna name. 
Britannia know not she be half so bless,
 till the divine rapture of thy breast,
 declare what else can never have be express. 
her glory shine in thy pathetic lay,
 so Colin once sing fame Elizia praise;
 long may thy Astr√¶a albion sceptre bear,
 while she the crown may you the laurel wear.
