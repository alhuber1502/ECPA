the bookworm.

come hither, boy, we will hunt to day
 the book-worm, raven beast of prey,
 produce by parent earth, at odds
 (as fame report it) with the god. 
he frantic hunger wild drive
 against a thousand author live:
 through all the field of wit he fly;
 dreadful his head with cluster eye,
 with horn without, and tusk within,
 and scale to serve he for a skin. 
observe he near, lest he climb
 to wound the bard of ancient time,
 or down the vale of fancy go
 to tear some modern wretch below:
 on every corner fix thy eye,
 or ten to one he slip thou by. 

see where his tooth a passage eat:
 we will rouse he from the deep retreat. 
but who the shelter force to give? 
it be sacred Virgil as i live! 
from leaf to leaf, from song to song,
 he draw the tadpole form along,
 he mount the gild edge before,
 he be up, he scud the cover over,
 he turn, he double, there he pass,
 and here we have he, catch at last. 

insatiate brute, who tooth abuse
 the sweet servant of the muse. 
(nay never offer to deny,
 i take thou in the fact to fly.) 
his rose nip in every page,
 my poor Anacreon mourn thy rage. 
by thou my Ovid wound lie;
 by thou my lesbia sparrow die:
 thy rabid tooth have half destroy
 the work of love in Biddy Floyd,
 they rend Belinda lock away,
 and spoil the blouzelind of gay. 
for all, for every single deed,
 relentless justice bid thou bleed. 
then fall a victim to the nine,
 my self the priest, my desk the shrine. 

bring Homer, Virgil, Tasso near,
 to pile a sacred altar here;
 hold, boy, thy hand outrun thy wit,
 you reach the play that d—s write;
 you reach i ph—s rustic strain;
 pray take your mortal bard again. 

come bind the victim, — there he lie,
 and here between his numerous eye
 this venerable dust i lay,
 from manuscript just sweep away. 

the goblet in my hand i take,
 (for the libation yet to make)
 a health to poet! all their day
 may they have bread, as well as praise;
 sense may they seek, and less engage
 in paper fill with party-rage. 
but if their riches spoil their vein
 you muse, make they poor again. 

now bring the weapon, yonder blade,
 with which my tuneful pen be make. 
i strike the scale that arm thou round,
 and twice and thrice i print the wound;
 the sacred altar float with red,
 and now he die, and now he be dead. 

how like the son of Jove i stand,
 this Hydra stretch beneath my hand! 
lay bare the monster entrails here,
 to see what danger threat the year:
 you god! what sonnet on a wench? 
what lean translation out of french? 
it be plain, this lobe be so unsound,
 s print, before the month go round. 

but hold, before i close the scene,
 the sacred altar shall be clean. 
oh have i Sh—ll's second bay,
 or to ! thy pert and humble lay! 
(you pair, forgive i, when i vow
 i never miss your work till now)
 i will tear the leaf to wipe the shrine,
 (that only way you please the nine)
 but since i chance to want these two,
 i will make the song of die do. 

rent from the corpse, on yonder pin,
 i hang the scale that brace it in;
 i hang my studious morning gown,
 and write my own inscription down. 

 'this trophy from the Python win,
' this robe, in which the deed be do,
 'these, Parnell glory in the feat,
' hang on these shelf, the muse seat. 
 'here ignorance and hunger find
' large realm of wit to ravage round;
 'here ignorance and hunger fall;
' two foe in one i send to hell. 
 'you poet, who my labour see,
' come share the triumph all with i! 
 'you critic! bear to vex the muse,
' go mourn the grand ally you lose.
