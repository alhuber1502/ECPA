prologue upon prologue.

write by mr. Garrick.

a old trite proverb let i quote! 
as be your cloth, so cut your coat. —
 to suit our author and his farce,
 short let i be! for wit be scarce. 
nor will i show it, have i any,
 the reason why be strong and many. 
shall i have wit, the piece have none,
 a flash in pan with empty gun,
 the piece be sure to be undo. 
a tavern with a gaudy sign,
 who bush be better than the wine,
 may cheat you once. — will that device,
 neat as import, cheat you twice? 

it be wrong to raise your expectation:
 poet be dull in dedication! 
dullness in these to wit prefer —
 but there indeed you seldom err. 
in prologue, preface, be flat! 
a silver button spoil your hat. 
a threadbare coat may joke escape,
 do not the blockhead lace the cape. 

a case in point to this before you,
 allow i, pray, to tell a story! 

to turn the penny, once, a wit
 upon a curious fancy hit;
 hang out a board on which he boast,
 dinner for threepence! boil and roast! 
the hungry read, and in they trip,
 with eager eye and smack lip:
 "here, bring this boil and roast, pray!"
 — enter potato — dress each way. 
all stare and rise, the house forsake,
 and damn the dinner — kick the cook,
 my landlord find, (poor Patrick Kelly),
 there be no joke with the belly. 

these fact lay down, then thus i reason:
 — wit in a prologue out of season —
 yet still will you for joke sit watch,
 like Cock-Lane folk for Fanny scratch? 
and here my simile so fit,
 for prologue be but ghost of wit,
 which mean to show their art and skill,
 and scratch you to their author will. 

in short, for reasous great and small,
 it be better to have none at all:
 prologue and ghost — a paltry trade,
 so let they both at once be lay! 
say but the word — give your command —
 we will tie our prologue-monger's hand:
 confine these culprit (hold up his hand) bind'em tight,
 nor girl can scratch nor fool can write.
