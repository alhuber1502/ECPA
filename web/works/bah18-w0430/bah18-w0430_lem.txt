song.

over the lone heath i wander wild,
 or sing beneath the hawthorn shade,
 while the soft breeze of evening mild
 hover around my careless head. 
sweet solitude, dear scene of calm repose! 
how far unlike the busy world be those. 

so fancy sing, ere young desire
 with grief, with joy inspire she lay,
 ere love have touch the soul with fire,
 and wake to life the conscious clay;
 sweet sympathy, sad joy, and tender woe,
 still how unlike the busy world be those.
