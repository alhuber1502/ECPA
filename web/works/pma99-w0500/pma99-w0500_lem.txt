a party at quadrille.

lady p. 

lady, your servant, this indeed be kind
 to come to one so much distress in mind;
 since Friday last, the day poor Pompey die,
 no soul i have see, nor leave my fireside. 

lady W. 

well, dear madam, talk no more of that,
 nothing be like a game at card, and chat,
 to ease the mind; i be sure i find it so
 when poor sir Simon die; you all well know
 how very much relieve i be by play;
 when morn be over i begin the day. 

mr. C. 

come lady, then it be best to lose no time,
 to dwell on grief i always deem a crime. 

lady p. 

pray, lady, take your place as you choose;
 in every seat i know i be sure to lose. 

mrs. F. 

to lose! dear madam, i think to leave off play,
 such card i sit with all the other day,
 when in this very house your ladyship win;
 it be what i never do, i have such a run. 
beasted such hand! i lose on Tuesday night
 three double mattadore, they break i quite. 

lady p. 

lady, your stake, we play our usual rate. 

mrs. F. 

here, madam, mine; it be go as sure as fate. 

lady p. 

sir, you have pass, i now may show my card;
 six mattadore; four fish be my reward. 

lady W. 

indeed! this way the card be sure to go,
 whatever game i play, or high or low. 
the other night i lose at lady vole
 my twenty shilling, now at lady poole
 this night i be like to lose three time that sum;
 i swear i will keep from mrs. fuzz drum,

mrs. F. 

i take a king if no one play alone. 

lady W. 

madam, i do; i will not sit like a drone
 with mattadore, six trump; it be monstrous hard
 to have a vole within one single card. 
may i have take a king i will have it clear,
 but some folk card will always play severe. 

mrs. F. 

severe indeed! sure mine the hard case be,
 to sit thus long, and never see the ace. 
and now, the first time i can take a king,
 i be supersede, that be the very thing. 
i sometime get a hand, but never play;
 i owe your ladyship four, i have none to pay. 

lady p. 

i will mark you up, dear madam, the usual way. 

mrs. F. 

well, now by chance at last i have get a game,
 and if you all give leave, my trump i will name;
 heart then it be; spadille i lead, oh fie! 
one hand without a trump! now hard they lie. 

lady p. 

madam, you have your game, no trump be in. 

mrs. F. 

yes, madam, because this hand of course must win. 

lady p. 

upon my honour, now, i have never play
 but one poor hand, and now six fish have pay. 
i vow next time i deal i will make a fuz. 

mrs. F. 

i wonder how your next door neighbour do;
 i hear last week he lose his only son,

lady p. 

yes, and his wife be die. what be do? 
i think your ladyship ask? i pass of course;
 upon my life my card get worse and worse. 

mrs. F. 

i be quite surprise, i be real call this time. 
it be your ladyship trick, it be none of i;
 for be not call i will be a bitter foe. 
let we see those card, i know not how they go. 

mr. C. 

lady, i think the vole at your command,
 at least i can prevent it by my hand. 

lady W. 

madam, you be to speak; pray search the trick again. 

mrs. F. 

my dear madam, i fear it be all in vain,
 one fatal chance will overset the whole;
 and yet it will make we both to win a vole. 
can you forgive i? may i now declare. 

lady p. 

madam, proceed; this be not quite so fair. 

lady W. 

oh, mrs. fret, you have ruin i indeed;
 how can it ever be win, and you to lead? 
my lady Poole do well to bid we play. 
when she will that knave; we have all the world to pay. 

mrs. F. 

indeed, i think so too; she draw i in;
 yet sure the chance be great that we shall win. 

lady W. 

by no mean, madam; your play i can excuse;
 i be sad wrong, for i can not refuse. 

lady p. 

well, lady, please to lay your money down,
 the pool my constant care, it be always know;
 i be sure you will mattadore, so give we five;
 now this may turn my luck, and i may thrive. 
poor mr. Carder be without a fish,
 but now he be rich, and just as he can wish. 

lady W. 

i know not who be rich, i be sure i be poor,
 and lay my ruin at that lady door. 

mrs. F. 

indeed, dear madam, you see i be quite undo;
 it be very hard to twit, when if we will win
 you will be the first to justify my paly;
 but let it pass your ladyship own way;
 this fine lone hand some of my debt will settle;
 it be but my due to ride on my own cattle. 

lady W. 

it be very lucky, mrs. fret, for you,
 but with these loss what be i to do? 
i wish with all my heart the pool be out,
 for i be engage to lady racket rout. 

lady p. 

that be quite distress, madam, but i submit;
 it will break our set; but just as you think fit. 
the pool be out, upon my word i win. 

lady W. 

indeed, i think your ladyship pawn be in,

lady p. 

oh no, i take that out a hour ago;
 i be sure, sir, you will witness it be so. 

mr. C. 

madam, i always think your ladyship right;
 i just have lose three guinea by the night. 

lady p. 

o lack-a-day! it be unpolite to beat
 our only man â€” it be a unlucky seat. 
we have win a even share, or very nigh. 
the card tonight have not run very high. 
lady, your humble servant, sir, good bye.
