ode to health.

by mr. Duncombe, fellow of Corpus Christi college, Cambridge.

i 

health! to thou thy votary owe
all the blessing life bestow,
all the sweet the summer yield,
melodious wood, and clovered field;
by thou he taste the calm delight
of studious day and peaceful night:
by thou his eye each scene with rapture view;
the muse shall sing thy gift, for they inspire the muse.

ii.

do increase of wealth impart
transport to a bounteous heart?
do the sire with smile survey
his prattle child round he play?
do love with mutual blush streak
the swain and virgin artless cheek?
from health these blush, smile and transport flow;
wealth, child, love itself, to health their relish owe.

iii.

nymph! with thou; at early morn,
let i brush the wave corn;
and, at noontide's sultry hour,
o bear i to the woodbine bower!
when evening light her glowworm, lead
to yonder dew-enamelled mead;
and let i range at night those glimmer grove,
where stillness ever sleep, and contemplation rove.

iv.

this my tributary lay,
grateful at thy shrine i pay,
who for seven whole year have shed
thy balmy blessing over my head;
o! let i still enamour view
those fragrant lip of rosy hue,
nor think there need the allay of sharp disease,
to quicken thy repast, and give it power to please.

v. 

now by swift zephyr draw,
urge thy chariot over the lawn;
in yond gloomy grotto lay,
 Palemon ask thy kindly aid;
if goodness can that aid engage,
o hover round the virtuous sage:
nor let one sigh for his own suffering rise;
each human suffering fill his sympathize eye.

vi.

Venus from Aeneas' side
with successful effort try
to extract the envenom dart,
that baffle wise iapis art,
if thus, hygeia, thou can prove
propitious to the queen of love,
now on thy favour Heberden bestow
thy choice heal power, for Pallas ask they now.

vii.

what though, banish from the fight,
to the hero trouble sight,
rank on rank tumultuous rose
of fly friend and conquer foe;
he only pant to obtain
a laurel wreath for thousand slay;
on noble view intent, the sage mind
pant to delight, instruct, and humanise mankind.
