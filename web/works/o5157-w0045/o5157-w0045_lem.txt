 vi. for a column at Runnymede.

thou, who the verdant plain do traverse here,
while Thames among his willow from thy view
retire; o stranger, stay thou, and the scene
around contemplate well. this be the place
where England ancient baron, clad in arm
and stern with conquest, from their tyrant king
(then render tame) do challenge and secure
the charter of thy freedom. pass not on
till thou have bless their memory, and pay
those thanks which god appoint the reward
of public virtue. and if chance thy home
salute thou with a father honour name,
go, call thy son: instruct they what a debt
they owe their ancestor; and make they swear
to pay it, by transmit down entire
those sacred right to which themselves be bear,
