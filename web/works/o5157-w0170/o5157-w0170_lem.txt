ode to Cupid on valentine day.

by the same.

come thou rosy-dimpled boy,
source of every heart-felt joy,
leave the blissful bower awhile,
paphos and the cyprian isle:
visit britain rocky shore,
briton too thy power adore.
briton hardy, bold, and free,
own thy law, and yield to thou.
source of every heart-felt joy,
come thou rosy-dimpled boy.

haste to Sylvia, haste away,
this be thy, and Hymen day;
bid she thy soft bondage wear,
bid she for love rite prepare.
let the nymph with many a flower
deck the sacred nuptial bower.
thither lead the lovely fair,
and let HYMEN too be there.
this be thy, and Hymen day,
haste to Sylvia, haste away.

only while we love we live,
love alone can pleasure give;
pomp and power, and tinsel state,
those false pageant of the great,
crown and sceptre, envy thing,
and the pride of eastern king,
be but childish empty toy,
when compare to love sweet joy,
love alone can pleasure give,
only while we love, we live.
