the shepherd pipe to the fish.

shepherd seek with his lass,
 to shun the heat of day;
 be seat on the shadow grass,
 near which a flow stream do pass,
 and fish within it play. 

to Phillis he a angle give,
 and bid she toss the line;
 for sure, quoth he, each fish must have,
 who do his not seek to be thy slave,
 a hard heart than i. 

assemble here you watery race,
 transport he cry;
 and if, when you behold her face,
 you ever desire to quit the place,
 you see not with my eye. 

but you, perhaps, be by the ear,
 more easy to be catch;
 if so, i have my bagpipe here,
 the only music that be not dear,
 nor in great city buy. 

so sprightly be the tune he choose,
 and often do repeat;
 that Phillis, though not up she rise,
 keep time with every thrill close,
 and jig upon her seat. 

but not a fish will near draw,
 no harmony or charm,
 their freeze blood, it seem, can thaw,
 nor all they hear, nor all they see,
 can woo they to such term. 

the angry shepherd in a Pett,
 give over his wheedle art,
 and from his shoulder throw the net,
 resolve he will a supper get
 by force, if not by part. 

thus state law be always best
 to rule the vulgar throng,
 who grow more stubborn when care,
 or with soft rhetoric address,
 if take measure wrong.
