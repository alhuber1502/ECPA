epitaph on a peasant.

by the same.

the Swain who own yond rural cot
 now lie near this sequester spot. 
with his industrious faithful wife
 he tread the path of humble life,
 nor know the sorrow which await
 the trifle revel of the great:
 here village lad at evening hour
 shall strew the late gather flower,
 and pensive nymph assemble here,
 to shed a sympathetic tear. 
o stranger! thy sad tribute give,
 like Damon die, like Damon live! 
for virtue last plaudit gain,
 when free from these terrestrial plain.
