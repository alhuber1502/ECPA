a grubstreet elegy on the suppose death of PATRIGE the almanackmaker.

Anno. 1708. 

well, it be as Bickerstaff have guest,
 though we all take it for a jest:
 Patrige be dead, nay more, he die
 ever he can prove the good squire lie. 
strange, and astrologer shall die,
 without one wonder in the sky;
 not one of all his crony star,
 to pay their duty at his hearse! 
no meteor, no eclipse appear! 
no comet with a flame beard! 
the sun have rise, and go to bed,
 just as if Patrige be not dead;
 nor hide himself behind the moon,
 to make a dreadful night at noon:
 he at fit period walk through Aries,
 however our earthly motion vary,
 and twice a year he will cut the æquator,
 as if there have be no such matter. 

some wit have wonder what analogy
 there be betwixt cobble and astrology;
 how Patrige make his optic rise,
 from a shoe sole to reach the sky;

a list the cobbler temple tie,
 to keep the hair out of their eye;
 from whence it be plain the diadem
 that prince wear derive from they;
 and therefore crown be nowadays
 adorn with golden star and ray,
 which plain show the near alliance
 betwixt cobble and the planet science. 
beside, that slow-paced sign boot
 as it be miscall, we know not who it be;
 but Patrige end all dispute,
 he know his trade, and call it Boots. 
the horn moon which heretofore
 upon their shoe the roman wear,
 who wideness keep their toe from corn,
 and whence we claim our shoe horn,
 show how the art of cobble bear
 a near resemblance to the sphere. 

a scrap of parchment hang by geometry,
 a great refinement in barometry,
 can like the star foretell the weather;
 and what be parchment else but leather? 
which a astrologer may use,
 either for almanac or shoe. 

thus Patrige, by his wit and part,
 at once do practice both these art:
 and as the bode owl, or rather
 the bat, because her wing be leather,
 steal from her private cell by night,
 and fly about the candlelight;
 so learned patrige can as well
 creep in the dark from leathern cell,
 and in his fancy fly as far,
 to peep upon a twinkle star. 

beside, he can confound the sphere,
 and set the planet by the ear:
 to show his skill, he Mars will join
 to Venus in aspect mali'n,
 then call in mercury for aid,
 and cure the wound that Venus make. 

great scholar have in Lucian read,
 when Philip king of Greece be dead,
 his soul and spirit do divide,
 and each part take a different side;
 one rise a star, the other fall
 beneath, and mend shoe in hell. 

thus Patrige still shine in each art,
 the cobble and stargazing part,
 and be install as good a star,
 as any of the Cæsars be. 

triumphant star! some pity show
 on cobbler militant below,
 who roguish boy in stormy night
 torment, by piss out their light;
 or through a chink convey their smoke,
 enclose artificer to choke. 

thou, high-exalted in thy sphere,
 may follow still thy call there. 
to thou the bull will lend his hide,
 by Phoebus new tan and dry. 
for thou they argo hulk will tax,
 and scrape her pitchy side for wax. 
then Ariadne kind lend
 her braid hair to make thou end;
 the point of Sagittarius dart,
 turn to a awl by heavenly art;
 and Vulcan wheedle by his wife,
 will forge for thou a paring-knife,
 for want of room by virgo side,
 she will strain a point, and sit astride,
 to take thou kind in between,
 and then the sign will be thirteen. 

the epitaph.

here five foot deep lie on his back
 a cobbler, starmonger, and quack,
 who to the star in pure goodwill,
 do to his best look upward still. 
weep all you customer that use
 his pill, his almanac, or shoe. 
and you that do your fortune seek,
 step to this grave but once a week,
 this earth which bear his body print,
 you will find have so much virtue in it,
 that i dare pawn my ear, it will tell
 whatever concern you full as well,
 in Physick, steal goods, or love,
 as he himself can, when above.
