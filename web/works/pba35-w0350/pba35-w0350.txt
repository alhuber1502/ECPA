On the Dutchess of Newcastle's Picture.

Say, Worsdeal, where you learn'd the Art
 To paint the Goodness of the Heart
 The flatt'ring Teint let others prize;
 You call the Soul into the Eyes:
 There we the various Virtues trace
 Of Churchil's, and Godolphin's Race. 
Thrice happy Pelham, to whose Arms
 Were destin'd never-fading Charms!
