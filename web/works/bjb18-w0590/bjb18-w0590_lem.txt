song,

for a irish air.

come, form we round a cheerful ring
 and broach the foam ale,
 and let the merry maiden sing,
 the beldame tell her tale. 

and let the sightless harper sit
 the blaze faggot near;
 and let the jester vent his wit,
 the nurse her bantling cheer. 

who shake the door with angry din,
 and will admit be? 
no, gossip winter! snug within,
 we have no room for thou. 

go scud it over killarney lake,
 and shake the willow bare,
 where water-elve their pastime take,
 thou will find thy comrade there. 

will-o'-the-wisp skip in the dell,
 the owl hoot on the tree,
 they hold their nightly vigil well,
 and so the while will we. 

then strike we up the rouse glee,
 and pass the beaker round,
 till every head, right merry
 be move to the sound.
