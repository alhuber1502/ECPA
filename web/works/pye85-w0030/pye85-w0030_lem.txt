to a friend;

on valentine day.

though bloom shepherd hail this day
 with love, the subject of each lay,
 yet friendship tune my artless song,
 to thou the grateful theme belong. 

Strephon, i never will repine,
 though destine not thy valentine;
 over friendship noble height we will rove,
 nor heed the soften voice of love. 

stranger to passion tyrant reign,
 careless, we will range the happy plain
 where all those calm joy we will prove,
 which wait sublime platonic love. 

yet i will allow a future day,
 when friendship must at last give way;
 when thou, forgetful, shall resign
 the maid who write this valentine. 

think not, my friend, i dream of love,
 that with some happy maid thou will prove;
 friendship alone be my design
 in this officious valentine. 

yet, when that victor god shall reign,
 and conquer friendship quit the plain,
 this gentle whispere captive take,
 it will all thy former kindness wake. 

but if its plead you deny,
 and fain will have remembrance die,
 then to devour flame consign
 my too ill-fated valentine.
