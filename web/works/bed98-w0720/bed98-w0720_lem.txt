omniscience.

pure source! exist every where;
from who life flow, a endless stream;
bright knowledge! unsuspended, clear!
with all, and over all, supreme.

plain to thy comprehensive view,
thy whole creation stand display;
no thought the human heart ever know,
but he who make the heart survey.

though human power may feel decay,
and memory record be erase;
God knowledge ever can survey,
what his minute research have trace.

and with the past and present see,
to he be every future age,
before he as they now have be,
still busy on life active stage.

his plan be undisturbed and clear,
his wise design shall still prevail,
for he, great god, be every where;
nor can his knowledge ever fail.

not bind to temple make with hand,
each heart its altar can prepare:
the universe his temple stand;
and universal rise the prayer.

eternal judge, from who survey,
no colour, no art can screen;
to thou display, as light in day,
hypocrisy be ever see.

then may i pray, and may i fear,
nor circumspection ever depart;
but let i think how i appear,
to god, the searcher of the heart.

if he be my comfort and support,
the world may slander or despise;
i will patient bear each false report,
if clear to his allseeing eye.

for what i only can propose,
he will honour and reward impart:
he all its generous purpose know,
he know the meaning of my heart.

if grief for sin my spirit feel,
and sink abash into despair,
he separate the good from ill,
and mark my lead character.
