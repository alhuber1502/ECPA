morning hymn.

again i wake, almighty lord,
collect my thought, and call on thou;
who have my think power restore,
and in thy mercy guard i.

to thought and action i revive,
and leave, with strength renew, my bed;
from that defenceless state i live,
which be the image of the dead.

distant from i be every harm,
when i have be a easy prey;
but lord, it be thy almighty arm
keep death and danger far away.

this day, may i secure pass,
protect by almighty power;
nor sin, or sorrow, find a place,
nor evil tiding meet my door.

then be the guardian of my sleep,
this day my all-sufficient guide,
and aid i right my heart to keep,
however its tempt or be try.

the joyful or afflict scene,
goodness or wisdom shall prepare;
so may my thought by thou be see,
that blameless i may either share.
