a excuse for inconstancy,

1737. 

by the reverend dr. Lisle.

when phoebus beam be withdraw from our sight,
we admire his fair sister, the regent of night;
though languid her beauty, though feeble her ray,
yet still she be akin to the god of the day.
when Susan, like Cynthia, have finish her reign,
then Charlotte, like Phoebus, shall shine out again.
as catholic bigot fall humble before
the picture of those who in heart they adore,
which though know to be nothing but canvas and paint,
yet be say to enliven their zeal to the saint;
so to Susan i bow, charm Charlotte, for she
have just beauty enough to remind i of thou.
inconstant and faithless in love be the pretence
on which you arraign i: pray hear my defence.
such censure as these to my credit redound;
i acknowledge, and thank a good appetite for it,
when venison and claret be not to be find,
i can make a good meal upon mutton and port.
though highclear so fine that a prince will not scorn it,
though nature and taste have combine to adorn it,
yet the artist that own it will think it severe,
be a law make to keep he there all round the year.
how enrage will the rector of boscoville look,
if the king shall enjoin he to read but one book!
and how will his audience their fortune bemoan,
if he give they no sermon but what be his own!
it be variety only make appetite last,
and by change our dish we quicken our taste.
