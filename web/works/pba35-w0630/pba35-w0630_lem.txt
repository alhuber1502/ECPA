to mrs. Newans, encourage she to draw lady killmorey picture.

you say it be hard to copy well,
 where nature do herself excel. 
allow â€” yet still let i advise:
 near as you can, to nature rise;
 nor time, nor colour will be lose;
 the draught will more than pay the cost. 
then dare to draw that angel face;
 the pencil may the feature trace;
 and, shall her air thy art defeat,
 add wing, the piece will be complete.
