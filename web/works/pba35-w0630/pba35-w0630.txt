To Mrs. Newans, encouraging her to draw Lady Killmorey's Picture.

You say 'tis hard to copy well,
 Where Nature does herself excel. 
Allow'd â€” yet still let me advise:
 Near as you can, to Nature rise;
 Nor Time, nor Colours will be lost;
 The Draught will more than pay the Cost. 
Then dare to draw that Angel Face;
 The Pencil may the Features trace;
 And, should her Air thy Art defeat,
 Add Wings, the Piece will be complete.
