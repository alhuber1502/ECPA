to his friend incline to marry.

i will not have you, Strephon, choose a mate
 from too exalt, or too mean a state:
 for in both these, we may expect to find
 a creep spirit, or a haughty mind. 
who move within the middle region, share
 the least disquiet, and the small care. 
let she extraction with true lustre shine,
 if something bright, not too bright for thy. 
her education liberal, not great,
 neither inferior, nor above her state. 
let she have wit, but let that wit be free
 from affectation, pride, and pedantry:
 for the effect of woman wit be such,
 too little be as dangerous, as too much. 
but chief let her humour close with thy,
 unless where you do to a fault incline. 
the least disparity in this destroy,
 like sulphurous blast, the very bud of joy. 
her person amiable, strait, and free
 from natural, or chance deformity. 
let not her year exceed, if equal thy,
 for woman past their vigour soon decline;
 her fortune competent, and if thy sight
 can reach so far, take care it be gather right. 
if thine enough, then she may be the less,
 do not aspire to riches in excess;
 for that which make our live delightful prove,
 be a genteel sufficiency, and love.
