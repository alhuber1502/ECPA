DULCE DOMUM,

AN OLD LATIN ODE.

SUNG ANNUALLY BY THE WINCHESTER BOYS UPON LEAVING COLLEGE AT THE VACATION.

[Translated at the Request of DR. JOSEPH WARTON.]

LOV'D Companions, let us sing! 
Wake the dear according string —
 Come, with gladness fill the dome,
 Pour the happy song of Home. 

CHORUS.

Now, sweet Home! our steps are free;
 Now, sweet Home! we fly to thee! 
Let the vaulted roofs resound
 Sacred Home, with blessings crown'd! 

Learning, thorny are thy ways,
 Thought is weary of the maze;
 Let us seek awhile the goal
 Where affection rests her soul! 

Now, O toiling Muse, repose;
 Muse! the classic volume close: —
 Bid the cares of study cease,
 Give the vacant hours to peace! 

Joyful with the smiling year,
 We will smile, for Home is near! —
 Strangers will our song repeat —
 Strangers feel that Home is sweet! 

Bring, O bring th' impatient steed,
 Let us to the threshold speed,
 Where we shed the tear of bliss,
 Where we meet a mother's kiss! 

Home of childhood! swell the strain,
 While we hail thy gates again! 
Why, Aurora, thus delay? 
Slothful goddess, give the day!
