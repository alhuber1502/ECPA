the horse and his rider.

brace in the sinewy vigour of thy breed,
 in pride of generous strength, thou stately steed! 
thy broad chest to the battle front be give,
 thy mane fair float to the wind of heaven;
 thy stamp hoof the flinty pebble break;
 graceful the rise of thy arch neck;
 thy bridle-bit white flake of foam enlock;
 from thy move nostril burst the curl smoke
 thy kindle eye-ball brave the glare south,
 and dreadful be the thunder of thy mouth:
 while low to earth thy curving haunch bend,
 thy sweepy tail involve in cloud of sand,
 erect in air thou rear thy front of pride,
 and ring the plate harness on thy side. 

but lo! what creature, goodly to the sight,
 dare thus bestride thou, chafe in thy might;
 of portly stature, and determine mien,
 who dark eye dwell beneath a brow serene,
 and forward look unmoved to scene of death,
 and smile, gentle stroke thou in thy wrath;
 who right hand do its flash falchion wield? 
a british soldier gird for the field.
