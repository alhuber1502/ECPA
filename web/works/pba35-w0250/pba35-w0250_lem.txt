write for my son, to some of the fellow of the college, who take care of the school in his master absence.

we of late have a terrible rout in our house;
 if i happen to speak, i be sure of a souse. 
my mamma have the toothache, and i feel the smart â€”
 o steel, i for ever will value thy art:
 both child, and servant, to thou be behold;
 let they do what they will, they be sure of a scold. 
Athenians, i humble beseech you, explain,
 why the tongue can rest, when the tooth be in pain.
