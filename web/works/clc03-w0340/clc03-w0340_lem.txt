to the queen most excellent majesty.

when heaven design some wondrous prince to raise,
deserve empire and eternal praise;
it choose one of a illustrious line,
in who hereditary grace shine:
who good and great by his descent be make,
and by the rule of native honour sway:
he it expose to the insult of fate,
to all the blow of malice and of hate,
before it raise he to a exalt state.

the pious trojan, its peculiar care,
do numerous hardship, numerous trial bear;
ten thousand toil with patience he sustain,
before he undisturbed in Latium reign:
to pain inure, with disappointment cross,
wan'dr through flame, on mount surge toss:
suffering and war to grandeur lead the way,
and fit he for independent sway.

happy that people who bless monarch owe
unto himself the wisdom which he show,
who prudence from his own experience flow.
who have in shade see darken vapor rise,
and gloomy horror overcast the sky:
neglect live in some obscure retreat,
and learn in secret to be true great;
to rule within, his passion to subdue,
and all his soul most hide movement view:
those spring of thought, which when they be refine
bestow a dazzle brightness on the mind:
who disengage from business and from noise,
to noble purpose his hour employ:
search past record, and with vast delight
present fame hero to his ravish sight:
see they the shine path of honour tread,
by praise push on, and dare courage lead:
with eag'rest have to lofty height ascend,
and their renown beyond the grave extend:
see pious king with joy and zeal obey,
and cheerful homage to wise prince pay:
who be still the object of a filial love,
who all admire, who action all approve.

such be that virgin glory of our isle,
on who Apollo long be please to smile:
who be with wisdom, and with science bless,
by every muse, and every grace caress:
she know affliction, feel a sister hate,
and learn to reign, while in a private state;
by adverse fortune teach her self to know,
that knowledge chief requisite below.

and such the queen who now the throne do grace,
the bright glory of her royal race:
in who rich vein the noble blood do flow
that god-like king, and hero can bestow:
like she she brave stand the shock of fate,
and live serene in a dependent state:
bore unconcerned the calumny of those
who their ill-nature only make her foe:
who think her merit too divine bright,
and strive t'eclipse the overflow light:
merit, in narrow mind do envy raise,
large generous soul be most incline to praise.
like she she stem the dangerous swell tide,
and soar aloft with a become pride:
like she a general approbation find,
and be with joyful acclamation crown:
even heaven it self her unction do approve,
and by auspicious omen show its love:
refresh breeze fan the balmy air,
the fertile earth a florid green do wear:
no cloud obscure the sun refulgent light,
he never shine more eminent bright:
all thing conspire she welcome to proclaim,
who the protectress of her people come,
by heaven design, and her propitious fate,
to be the bulwark of a totter state.

Britannia now all glorious do arise,
and shoot her head above the starry sky:
her sacred guardian, all the son of light,
with shout of joy behold the please sight:
the listen goddess hear the cheerful sound,
from hill to hill, from vale to vale rebound:
on all her plume at once, sublime she fly,
at once employ her numerous tongue and eye:
to distant land our happiness make know;
tell they a heroin fill the british throne:
a heroin great than romance can frame,
and worthy of the line from whence she come;
in who the great and brave, the soft and kind,
in one be by the firm tie combine:
where nothing be want that we can desire,
and where we see each minute something to admire.

the tremble nation awe by gallic arm,
implore come, draw by resistless charm:
to she they sue, and beg from her relief;
she look with god-like pity on their grief:
exert her power, and make the iberian shore;
the Spaniard hear she murder Canon roar?
her fleet dilate a panic terror round,
and british valour once more dreadful find:
her troop descend with noble ardor fire,
by heaven, and their heroic queen inspire:
in vain they strive their darling gold to save,
what can resist the dare and the brave?
those son of war through danger force their way,
and from the dragon snatch the shine prey:
fame spread the news through all the encircle air;
aloud proclaim the triumph of the fair:
the droop eagle prune their wing and rise,
with joyful haste they cut the sound sky;
secure once more of that auspicious fate
which on they do so many age wait:
the belgic lion cast his fear away,
and with new strength pursue the destine prey:
all the distress with rapture of delight,
in sweet song of grateful praise unite:
bless albion queen their only theme do prove;
like Pallas spring from all-commanding Jove,
she come, they sing, to give we timely aid,
be kind, and wise, as that celestial maid:
as able to advise, and to defend,
and do her care to every part extend:
like Ph≈ìbus dart revive beam of light,
and dissipate the horror of the night.

o that i can the best of queen attend;
can at your foot my come moment end:
i past misfortune shall not then deplore,
and present evil will afflict no more:
but fill with joy, with transport, and with love,
my hour will in a blissful circle move:
and i the noble business still will choose,
both for my self, and my ambitious muse,
be still employ in service, and in praise,
in glad attendance, and in grateful lay,
