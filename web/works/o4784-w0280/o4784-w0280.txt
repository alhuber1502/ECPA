The House of Socrates. 

FOR Socrates a House was built,
 Of but inferiour Size;
 Not highly Arch'd, nor Carv'd, nor Gilt;
 The Man, 'tis said, was Wise. 

But Mob despis'd the little Cell,
 That struck them with no Fear;
 Whilst Others thought, there should not dwell
 So great a Person there. 

How shou'd a due Recourse be made
 To One, so much Admir'd? 
Where shou'd the spacious Cloth be laid,
 Or where the Guests retir'd? 

Believe me, quoth the list'ning Sage,
 'T was not to save the Charge;
 That in this over-building Age,
 My House was not more large. 

But this for faithful Friends, and kind,
 Was only meant by me;
 Who fear that what too streight you find,
 Must yet contracted be.
