to albion bard, the muse of history speak;
 "record the glory of your native land,
" how her brave son the bond of slavery break,
 "and power fell rod tear from the oppressor hand,

 "give to renown the patriot noble deed,
" brand with disgrace the tyrant hate name;
 "though falsehood oft awhile the mind mislead,
" impartial time bestow impartial fame. " 

she say, and soon the lofty lyre they string,
 but, artful, change the subject and the lore,

 but touch on freedom genuine note no more.

 anxious for truth, for public virtue warm,
 she, freedom faithful advocate, appear,
 and bear on earth the fair macaulay form.
