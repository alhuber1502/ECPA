a letter write by the author for a friend, to one in town; be a satyr, on dingboy and a rampant widow. 1685. 

abroad when dingboy verse come,
and in the scrowl you read my name,
too well my dear friend i know
you blush as much as i do now,
not that you think my scanty crime
have not deserve satyric rhime;
but that i shall a subject be,
for the pen of such a dunce as he,
who empty noddle still take pain
without a dram of sense of brain,
to make my fame about the town,
as black and ugly as his own.
nature a signal shame have mean,
to the obstinate and ignorant,
and dingboy above all mankind
the curse of his own vice do find;
it be plague enough to be a fool,
wretched poor, and proud, as dull,
to aim at wit and write well,
and yet not have the fence to spell,
to give the noble art abuse,
by dare to invoke a muse.
this, one will think, be shame enough,
if blockhead ever can taste reproof;
but he, as if the genius flee
from the barren soil of such a head;
still plunge on, and with strange flight
of new invent nonsense write;
fame give it out, the unthinking beast
once set up for a romish priest,
with goggle eye, and supple ham,
train up to all their trick and sham;
but never be wise enough to know,
whether the rat be damn or no,
that eat the consecrate Dough:
thing past his reach he never dare hope,
but after get into a troop,
where now he lurk, roar, huff, and fight,
with the same genius that he write.
don quixot-like play prank in vain,
plague by the wind-mill in his brain;
now rail, now write, but such a stile,
so filthy dogril and so vile,
he dip his pen we well may think
in excrement instead of ink,
such rhime on wall of common Jakes,
which every bum for easement take:
i many time have see ill write
with finger and a thumb be —
yet they appear to this dull sot,
as fine as ever Cowley write,
such shameful madness still we see
in impudent stupidity;
but here let leave he for a while
in the Jakes, which can his fame defile,
and turn to jerk the female friend,
he do so wretched defend;
oh woman, bear for man delight,
his ease by day, his joy by night,
you useful mischief which we keep
to procreate, eat, drink, and sleep;
you ladle which we fool require,
to cool the broth of our desire,
design, no doubt, for our relief,
though oft convert to our grief:
listen to one oblige to rail,
and mark the justice of my tale;
and you, who to our cost we find,
the worst of all that baneful kind,
widow i mean, who lose your sense,
when want due benevolence.
with solid confidence prepare,
and harken to the character
of the most lewd and rampant whore,
that ever — in a bandore;
from taplash froth of nappy ale,
she have her great original;
her father in a drunken fit,
the she cle monster do beget,
and bring a pattern of new crime
to plague the world in after time;
unfortunate the man, and curse,
that do the sin to wed her first,
but the dunce that second wedlock name
be beyond all redemption dame,
no flesh on earth so wretched make,
nor hell hereafter half so bad;
the rogue that rob to buy he bread,
when hang atone for the ill deed,
who act all other deadly sin,
with his own blood clear each offence.
his punishment do pain release,
nor do his crime retard his peace;
but he that do a widow wed,
in lust and rank contagion breed,
fomenter of revengeful feud,
and beyond Messalina lewd,
one that have still infect be,
with all the plague of female sin,
and like the grave or greedy sea,
swallow up all come in her way;
who yoke with she be doom for slaughter,
and worse hell here than that hereafter:
and now to let the reader see
the curse of weak humanity;
among the great that appear,
to vex my late ill manage year,
lead by the blind effort of nature;
it be my ill fate to love this creature,
and what from charity begin,
to she, her husband, and her son,
by passion be so hurry on,
her family and i be one;
about my neck the snake i hang,
not think i shall ere be sting;
and still to love (make resolution)
a fiend that study my confusion;
this jilt who my misguided power,
have feed in her salacious hour,
and gorge her mercenary lust
with love unfeigned, though unjust;
pardon i, oh thou better part,
that have deserve, and have my heart;
pardon i, virtue, that do know
what folly wild desire will do,
and let my shame and penitence
atone for my confess offence;
but let ferment spleen swell high,
when i relate her infamy,
who like the fury be endue
with baseness and ingratitude;
oft when the black intrigue be frame
by witchcraft and desire inflame,
have the perfidious strumpet swear,
still to love i, and no one more;
but gift do all this kindness buy,
for still so fond, so blind be i,
that i pursue the guilty curse,
and prove my passion by my purse;
as oft i have by wine inspire,
but never so oft as she desire:
this be a secret, i confess,
if the nature of her fault be less;
but crime, like she, nor can, nor may,
be punish any other way.
oh that my pen be fill with Gall,
to write this next, this worst of all,
and that her rage and lechery,
be prove to nation as to i;
know then, this creature scandal proof,
this very widow that be enough,
forget all the numerous scrowl,
she send i when we mingle soul;
the oath and vow, and all the dame,
deceit through all her letter cram,
which that the world the truth may know
under her hand i keep to show:
this prostitute, this fiend in crape,
dare now accuse i for a rape,
and swear i force she chastity,
that be more like to ravish i;
such flame there be, such scorch fire,
in women uncontrolled desire,
it be this that do my soul perplex,
this move my hatred to the sex,
swell my full spleen, and make i prove
my anger far above my love,
for never be a woman better use,
nor never man so much abuse;
and though the champion of this Trull,
in dogril rhime still play the fool,
nonsense malicious express,
it be but the nature of the beast;
he only show his little spite,
and snarl and grin, but never can bite;
he mean no ill what ever he say,
but cat will mew, dog have their day;
bully, and cur, run open mouth;
but oaken cudgel fright they both.
and now a word or two let we spare,
to descant on the husband care,
the husband that new joy have try,
and find the Indies in a bride;
a easy passage through the straight,
where Lucifer and Charon wait,
to carry the next comer over,
where many a man have go before.
have he no way to shun this fate,
no warn of his future state?
be there no halter, no kind hand
to tip he into some deep pond?
no drug nor ratsbane to be buy,
to rid he from his dreadful lot?
it be hard, but wretched man never know
till it be too late his cure of woe;
for it be beyond all doubt it ever
his wife salt freak have reach his ear,
which all the country round can tell,
and her first c—old know too well.
he will some friendly razor choose,
or happy cord on rafter use,
ere slip into dame widow noose.
but there i leave he to be merry,
and now the satyr grow weary,
think fit, dear friend, to bid adue.
and pardon ask for tire you;
as for fallacious and her man,
especial the champion pen,
as he like this, i hope he will write again.
