the peacock.

a fable. 

inscribe (once at a wedding) to the bashaw of utopia. 

once Juno bird (as author say)
 be seize on by some bird of prey:
 they pluck his feather, one by one,
 till all his useful plume be go;
 strip he of every thing beside;
 but leave his train, to please his pride. 

some other bird admire to see,
 he tame bear such injury;
 and often on his patience joke —
 he cry — they must not be provoke:
 i be in their power, nor shall debate,
 but yield to my unhappy fate. 

yet in this plight will he resort,
 to where the eagle keep his court:
 for, though oppress, he still be proud
 to make his bow among the croud. 

the eagle, gracious, see he there;
 which envious courtier can not bear,
 well know, shall he tread that soil,
 he will in time put in for spoil. 

as tameness injury provoke,
 in bird, as well as mortal folk;
 the peacock they assault again,
 and strip he of his glitter train. 

enrage at this, he stamp and tear,
 and quote precedent a score,
 that peacock ever be allow
 to show their beauty to the croud. 

at this the haughty courtier sneer,
 and cry, what business have you here? 
he have a right, they plain see;
 but let he know, that power be law. 

at length a pheasant stand by,
 behold he with a pity eye:
 and say, you now begin too late
 to stem the torrent of your fate:
 yet be you not of all bereave;
 for still a fair retreat be leave:
 why will you here neglect roam,
 when you may be revere at home?
