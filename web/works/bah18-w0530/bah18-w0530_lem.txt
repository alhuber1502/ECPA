song.

when hollow burst the rush wind,
 and heavy beat the shower,
 this anxious, ache bosom find
 no comfort in its power. 

for ah, my love! it little know
 what thy hard fate may be;
 what bitter storm of fortune blow,
 what tempest trouble thou. 

a wayward fate have twine the thread
 on which our day depend,
 and darkling in the chequer shade. 
she draw it to a end. 

but whatsoever may be thy doom,
 the lot be cast for i;
 or in the world, or in the tomb,
 my heart be fix on thou.
