Sylvia and ARMEDA. 

ARMEDA.

why do thou Sylvia pensive sit? 
why hang that cloud upon thy brow? 
oft have thou cheere we by thy wit,
 why thus reserve and sullen now? 

have thou thy little lap-dog lose? 
can celia dress excite envy? 
be Flavia now the favourite toast,
 or do thou for a lover sigh? 

Sylvia.

be Flavia still the toast of beaux;
 such trifle never can give i pain:
 but know the cause of all my woe,
 the dear alonzo leave the plain. 

his music oft have charm the grove;
 so soft his pipe, so sweet his air:
 none hear, but feel the power of love,
 among all the nymph assemble there. 

not philomel delightful strain
 can such ecstatic joy impart,
 as do thy note, o darling swain! 
which well can cheer the anxious heart. 

his countenance as Aurora bright,
 his smile give joy to all around:
 in virtue, wit, and all that be right,
 alonzo equal never be find. 

to anna bank, alas! he be go;
 to Eccles fame for maiden fair;
 and, to augment my grievous moan,
 i dread some powerful rival there. 

ARMEDA.

o Sylvia, all your fear be vain;
 i have see the nymph display their art,
 to captivate your charm swain;
 but none can there engage his heart. 

insensible he seem to grow;
 defy the little arm boy:
 from his love horse, a fatal throw
 do more his anxious thought employ. 

than Cupid arrow more severe,
 the wound he get his care now prove:
 can Sylvia think it strange to hear
 Alonzo quite forget to love? 

Sylvia.

forget to love! that must not be;
 sure Sylvia will be wretched then. 
Alonzo, when deprive of thou,
 rough winter still deform the plain. 

o hasten and dispel my fear! 
the bird with thou more sweet sing. 
o crown with joy revolve year! 
thy presence give perpetual spring.
