the fifteen psalm paraphrase. 

who on thy holy hill, my god, shall rest,
and be with everlasting pleasure bless?
the man who blameless be, and still sincere,
and who not judge do but his conscience fear:
who practice be a transcript of thy law,
and who thy omnipresence keep in awe:
who speak the truth, and will much soon die,
than owe his life to the loathe refuge of a lie.
who soul be free from falsehood and design,
and in who word integrity do his shine:
who scorn to flatter, and by little art
to purchase treasure, or inveigle heart:
who to his neighbour have no mischief do,
do spiteful action with abhorrence shun,
and can be to what be inhuman win:
who think the best, and none will ever defame,
but as his own, preserve another name:
who be ever humble, and be still incline
t'inspect himself, and his own fail find:
who love reproof, and a respect do his pay
to those who kind guide he in his way,
who love the good, those who to virtue true,
its dictate always cheerful pursue;
and a regard for honour in their action show:
who when he swear, true to his oath will prove,
and who nor fear, nor interest ever can move,
(no, not though it to his prejudice shall be,)
to disappoint his great enemy:
much less, though to his ruin it shall tend,
once to deceive a kind confide friend:
who brave avaricious thought disdain,
and be a stranger to base sordid gain:
who will rather starve than the innocent betray,
or to base undermine thought give way:
he who live thus, who this his business make,
and never once the path of life forsake,
like some strong tower unshaken shall remain,
and all the battery of fate sustain.
