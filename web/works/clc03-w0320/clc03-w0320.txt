The Fifteenth Psalm Paraphras'd. 

WHO on thy Holy Hill, my God, shall rest,
And be with everlasting Pleasures blest?
The Man who blameless is, and still sincere,
And who no Judge do's but his Conscience fear:
Whose Practice is a Transcript of thy Law,
And whom thy Omnipresence keeps in awe:
Who speaks the Truth, and wou'd much sooner die,
Than owe his Life to the loath'd Refuge of a Lie.
Whose Soul is free from Falshood and Design,
And in whose Words Integrity do's shine:
Who scorns to flatter, and by little Arts
To purchase Treasures, or inveagle Hearts:
Who to his Neighbour has no Mischief done,
Do's spiteful Actions with Abhorrence shun,
And cannot be to what's Inhuman won:
Who thinks the best, and none will e'er defame,
But as his own, preserves another's Name:
Who's ever humble, and is still inclin'd
T'inspect himself, and his own Failings find:
Who loves Reproofs, and a Respect do's pay
To those who kindly guide him in his Way,
Who loves the Good, those who to Virtue true,
Its Dictates always cheerfully pursue;
And a Regard for Honour in their Actions shew:
Who when he swears, true to his Oath will prove,
And whom nor Fear, nor Int'rest e'er can move,
(No, not tho' it to's Prejudice should be,)
To disappoint his greatest Enemy:
Much less, tho' to his Ruin it should tend,
Once to deceive a kind confiding Friend:
Who bravely avaricious Thoughts disdains,
And is a Stranger to base sordid Gains:
Who'd rather starve than th' Innocent betray,
Or to base undermining Thoughts give way:
He who lives thus, who this his Bus'ness makes,
And never once the Paths of Life forsakes,
Like some strong Tow'r unshaken shall remain,
And all the Batteries of Fate sustain.
