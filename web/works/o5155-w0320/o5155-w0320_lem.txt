in answer to a lady who advise retirement.

by the same.

you little know the heart that you advise;
i view this various scene with equal eye:
in crowd court i find myself alone,
and pay my worship to a noble throne.
long since the value of this world i know,
pity the madness, and despise the show.
well as i can my tedious part i bear,
and wait for my dismission without fear.
seldom i mark mankind detest way,
not hear censure, nor affect praise;
and, unconcerned, my future state i trust
to that sole be, merciful and just.
