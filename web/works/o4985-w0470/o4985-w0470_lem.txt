ode to solitude.

by the same.

thou, that at deep dead of night
 walk forth beneath the pale moon light,
 in robe of flow black array,
 while cypress-leaf thy brow overshade;
 listen to the crow cock,
 and the distant sound clock;
 or sit in thy cavern low,
 do hear the bleak wind loud blow,
 or the hoarse death-boding owl,
 or village maistiff wakeful howl,
 while through thy melancholy room
 a dim lamp cast a awful gloom;
 thou, that on the meadow green,
 or daisy upland art not see,
 but wander by the dusky nook,
 and the pensive-falling brook,
 or near some rugged, herbless rock,
 where no shepherd keep his flock! 
muse maid, to thou i come,
 hate the tradeful city hum;
 o let i calm dwell with thou,
 from noisy mirth and business free,
 with meditation seek the sky,
 this folly-fettered world despise!
