a apology for my son to his master, for not bring a exercise on the coronation day.

why be we scholar plague to write,
 on day devote to delight? 
in honour of the king, i will play
 upon his coronation day:
 but as for loyalty in rhyme,
 defer that to another time. 

now to excuse this to my master —
 (this want of rhyme a sad disaster)
 sir, we confess you take great pain,
 and break your own, to mend our brain. 
you strive to make we learn, and wise;
 but to what end? — we shall not rise:
 in vain shall at preferment aim,
 while stranger make their happy claim. 
why shall we labour to excel,
 doom in obscurity to dwell? 
then, since our welfare give you pain,
 (and yet your toil may prove in vain)
 i wish, for your, and for our ease,
 that all be coronation day.
