on a real instance of disinterest friendship

ill skill my youthful hand to guide
 the just descriptive pen;
 else with a poet noble pride
 i will draw the best of man. 

you unseen being that attend
 in realm of pure light,
 assist to paint the orphan friend,
 the good, the matchless w——te. 

and listen while i tell the tale,
 more like a fancy dream:
 one night, as languid, faint, and pale,
 i view bright luna beam,

i rove by yond fair building side,
 that strike the wonder sight,
 then tower high in airy pride
 dim through the gloom of night,

my mind overcloud be with woe,
 as dismal as the scene;
 shade over my fate do thicken grow,
 no ray can intervene:

but he be nigh, the friend of all
 behold with tender care;
 and still awake to pity call,
 my sorrow wish to share. 

he speak, you heaven! the please sound
 still vibrate in my ear;
 word which may heal the deep wound,
 and dissipate each fear. 

but, oh! it be not word alone;
 for bounteous deed do prove,
 a goodness to the world unknown
 his manly breast do move. 

on earth each break heart elate
 behold he with delight;
 and heaven shall open every gate. 
to welcome matchless w——te!
