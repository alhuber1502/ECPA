a song.

i 

Damon in vain you strive to move;
 it be true my heart be form for love,
 and own its native flame. 
but such a flame, so pure a fire,
 Philander only can inspire,
 and all its softness claim. 

ii.

no more of cruel scorn complain,
 too late, alas! you own your pain,
 too late to find a cure. 
if friendship to your view be due,
 taste all the ease that can bestow,
 but Damon ask no more.
