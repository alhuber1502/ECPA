song iii.

you gentle nymph and generous dame
that rule over every british mind;
be sure you soothe their amorous flame,
be sure your law be not unkind.

for hard it be to wear their bloom
in unremitting sigh away:
to mourn the night oppressive gloom,
and faint bless the rise day.

and cruel it be a free-born swain,
a british youth shall vain moan;
who scornful of a tyrant chain,
submit to you, and you alone.

nor point spear, nor link of steel,
can ever those gallant mind subdue,
who beauty wound with pleasure feel,
and boast the fetter wrought by you.
