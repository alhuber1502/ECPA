The POWER of MUSIC.

A SONG.

Imitated from the SPANISH.

By the same.

Set to Music by Dr. HAYES.

I.

WHEN Orpheus went down to the regions below,
Which Men are forbidden to see,
He tun'd up his lyre, as old histories shew,
To set his Eurydice free.

II

All hell was astonish'd a person so wise
Shou'd rashly endanger his life,
And venture so far, — but how vast their surprise!
When they heard that he came for his wife.

III.

To find out a punishment due to his fault,
Old Pluto had puzzled his brain,
But hell had not torments sufficient, he thought,
— So he gave him his wife back again.

IV.

But pity succeeding found place in his heart,
And pleas'd with his playing so well,
He took her again in reward of his art;
Such merit had music in hell!
