a ode to charity.

i

hail meek-eyed daughter of the sky,
celestial, heaven-born, charity;
to thou my lay be due,
to thou for ever will i sing,
and soar on contemplation wing,
to peace, to joy, and you.

ii

thou great virtue man can boast,
fair offspring of the heavenly host,
accept my humble prayer;
thou source of bliss for ever new,
may i thy impulse still pursue,
with energy sincere.

iii

thy precept dignify the heart,
and banish each anxious smart,
with influence divine,
then steal, o steal, into my breast,
where every feeling stand confess,
before thy sacred shrine.

iv

conduct i to that calm retreat,
where thou have fix thy peaceful seat,
where charm supreme abound,
where bliss ecstatic deign to roam,
where sweet content have fix her throne,
and glory shine around.

v

o lead i to that sacred shrine,
where piety and grace divine,
alternate do reign,
where love, and friendship, join to please,
with strict sincerity and ease,
without one anxious pain.

vi

there calumny destructive dart,
no more invade the honest heart,
or wound the gentle breast,
but peace seraphic sooth the mind,
and every bliss in thou combine,
transport the soul to rest.

vii

thither retire from grief and pain,
from envy and ambition train,
my future day i will spend,
and in thy pure society,
from pride, deceit, and folly free,
this life of sorrow end.

viii

glad i will quit this wretched state,
and will yield my breath to fate,
without one pang, one sigh,
well please with heaven all just decree,
sustain by faith, by hope, and thou,
content to live or die.
