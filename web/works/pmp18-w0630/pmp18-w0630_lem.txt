the fly.

say, sire of insect, mighty Sol
 (a fly upon the chariot-pole
 cry out) what blew-bottle alive
 do ever with such fury drive? 
tell, Belzebub, great father, tell
 (say tother, perch upon the wheel)
 do ever any mortal fly
 raise such a cloud of dust, as i? 

my judgement turn the whole debate:
 my valour save the sink state. 
so talk two idle buzz thing;
 toss up their head, and stretch their wing. 
but let the truth to light be bring:
 this neither speak, nor other fight:
 no merit in their own behav'or:
 both raise, but by their party favour.
