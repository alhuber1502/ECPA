[song.]

where do thou bide, bless soul of my love! 
be ether thy dwelling, o whisper i where! 
rapt in remembrance, while lonely i rove,
 i gaze on bright cloud, and i fancy thou there. 

or to thy bower when muse i go,
 i think, it be thy voice that i hear in the breeze;
 soft it seem to speak peace to my woe,
 and life once again for a moment can please. 

if this be phrensy alone, it be so dear,
 that long may the please delusion be nigh;
 still ellen voice in the breeze may i hear,
 still see in bright cloud the kind beam of her eye!
