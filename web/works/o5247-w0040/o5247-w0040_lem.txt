a hymn to Venus, in imitation of sapho. 

Venus, queen of tender fire,
 please pain, and soft desire;
 sweet enslaver of the heart,
 here thy gentle aid impart;
 to my mourn soul give ease,
 and bid my soft complain cease. 

ii.

hither beauteous goddess move,
 leave a while the idalian grove;
 once more to my transport breast,
 come a mild, a grateful guest;
 there confirm thy please reign,
 free from care, and free from pain. 

iii.

oh! if ever my artless strain,
 by thou inspire, breathe thy pain;
 propitious now thy suppliant hear,
 and grant a lover ardent prayer? 
ah! let i not despair mourn,
 but meet a kind, a wish return. 

iv.

make Philander feel my power,
 fear my scorn, my smile adore,
 let the dear deceiver know,
 all the pain he can bestow:
 to i that value heart resign,
 and fix the lovely wanderer mine.
