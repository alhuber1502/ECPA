Protogenes and Apelles.

when poet write, and painter draw,
 as nature point out the view:
 ever gothic form be know in Greece,
 to spoil the well-proportioned piece:
 and in our verse ever monkish rhime
 have jangle their fantastic chime:
 ever on the flowery land of Rhodes
 those knight have fix their dull abode,
 who know not much to paint or write,
 nor care to pray, nor dare to fight:
 Protogenes, historian note,
 live there, a Burgess Scot and lot;
 and, as old Pliny write show,
 Apelles do the same at co.  
agree these point of time, and place,
 proceed we in the present case. 

picque by protogenes fame,
 from co to Rhodes, Apelles come;
 to see a rival and a friend,
 prepare to censure, or commend,
 here to absolve, and there object,
 as art with candor may direct. 
he sail, he land, he come, he ring:
 his servant follow with the thing:
 appear the governante of th'house:
 (for such in Greece be much in use.) 
if young or handsome, yea or no,
 concern not i, or thou to know. 

do esquire Protogenes live here? 
yes, sir, say she with gracious air,
 and curtsy low; but just call out
 by lord peculiar devout;
 who come on purpose, sir, to borrow
 our Venus, for the feast tomorrow,
 to grace the church: it be venus day:
 i hope, sir, you intend to stay,
 to see our Venus: it be the piece
 the most renowned throughout all Greece,
 so like the original, they say:
 but i have no great skill that way. 
but, sir, at six (it be now past three)
 Dromo must make my master tea:
 at six, sir, if you please to come,
 you will find my master, sir, at home. 

tea, say a critic big with laughter,
 be find some twenty age after:
 author, before they write, shall read:
 it be very true; but we will proceed. 

and, sir, at present will you please
 to leave your name — fair maiden, yes:
 reach i that board. no soon speak
 but do. with one judicious stroke,
 on the plain ground Apelles draw
 a circle regular true:
 and will you please, sweetheart, say he,
 to show your master this from i? 
by it he present will know,
 how painter write their name at co. 

he give the pannel to the maid. 
smile and curt'se, sir, she say,
 i shall not fail to tell my master:
 and, sir, for fear of all disaster,
 i will keep it my own self: safe bind,
 say the old proverb, and safe find. 
so, sir, as sure as key or lock —
 your servant sir — at six a clock. 

again at six Apelles come;
 find the same prate civil dame. 
sir, that my master have be here,
 will by the board it self appear. 
if from the perfect line he find,
 he have presume to swell the round,
 or colour on the draught to lay;
 it be thus (he order i to say)
 thus write the painter of this isle:
 let those of co remark the style. 

she say; and to his hand restore
 the rival pledge, the missive board. 
upon the happy line be lay
 such obvious light, and easy shade;
 that paris' apple stand confess,
 or leda egg, or cloe breast. 

Apelles view the finish piece;
 and live, say he, the art of Greece! 
however Protogenes and i
 may in our rival talent vie;
 however our work may have express,
 who true draw, or colour best;
 when he behold my flow line;
 he find at least i can design:
 and from his artful round, i grant,
 that he with perfect skill can paint. 

the dull genius can fail
 to find the moral of my tale:
 that the distinguish part of man,
 with compass, pencil, sword, or pen,
 shall in life visit leave their name,
 in character, which may proclaim
 that they with ardor strive to raise
 at once their art, and country have praise:
 and in their work take great care,
 that all be full, and round, and fair.
