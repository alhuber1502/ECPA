write in she Milton. 

by mr. Bradbury.

see here, how bright the firstborn virgin shine;
 and how the first fond lover be undo. 
such charm word our beauteous mother speak,
 as Milton write; and such as you her look. 
you the best copy of the original face,
 who beauty be to furnish all the race:
 such chain no author can escape but he:
 there be no way to be safe, but not to see.
