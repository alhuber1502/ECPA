TO THE COUNTESS of DORSET.

Written in her Milton. 

By Mr. BRADBURY.

See here, how bright the first-born Virgin shone;
 And how the first fond Lover was undone. 
Such charming Words our beauteous Mother spoke,
 As Milton wrote; and such as Your's Her Look. 
Your's the best Copy of th' Original Face,
 Whose Beauty was to furnish all the Race:
 Such Chains no Author could escape but He:
 There's no Way to be safe, but not to See.
