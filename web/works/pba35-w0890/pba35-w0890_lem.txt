to mrs. armine Cartwright, at bath.

lovely Armina, over her book recline,
 impair her body, to improve her mind:
 of wisdom fond, as other be of wealth,
 in that pursuit will sacrifice her health:
 then, miser-like, when she have gain the prize,
 hide both herself, and treasure, from our eye. 
in this alone, Armina, you be to blame,
 regardless of your health, or friendship claim:
 a giddy, thoughtless world your aid require;
 and ignorance prevail, when you retire. 
why, form to please! and why, improve with care! 
be there no end, in be wise, and fair?
