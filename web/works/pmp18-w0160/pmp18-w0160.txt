TO THE AUTHOR OF THE Foregoing PASTORAL.

By Silvia if thy charming Self be meant;
 If Friendship be thy Virgin Vows Extent;
 O! let me in Aminta's Praises join:
 Her's my Esteem shall be, my Passion Thine. 
When for Thy Head the Garland I prepare;
 A second Wreath shall bind Aminta's Hair:
 And when my choicest Songs Thy Worth proclaim;
 Alternate Verse shall bless Aminta's Name:
 My Heart shall own the Justice of Her Cause;
 And Love himself submit to Friendship's Laws. 

But if beneath thy Numbers soft Disguise,
 Some favor'd Swain, some true Alexis lyes;
 If Amaryllis breaths thy secret Pains;
 And thy fond Heart beats Measure to thy Strains:
 May'st thou, howe'er I grieve, for ever find
 The Flame propitious, and the Lover kind:
 May Venus long exert her happy Pow'r,
 And make thy Beauty, like thy Verse, endure:
 May ev'ry God his friendly Aid afford;
 Pan guard thy Flock, and Ceres bless thy Board. 

But if by chance the Series of thy Joys
 Permit one Thought less chearful to arise;
 Piteous transfer it to the mournful Swain,
 Who loving much, who not belov'd again,
 Feels an ill-fated Passion's last Excess;
 And dies in Woe, that Thou may'st live in Peace.
