On my Recovery.

God of my Life and lengthen'd Days! 
To Thee my Breath I owe. 
Teach me my grateful Voice to raise,
 In Sounds that sweetly flow. 

When sinking to the silent Grave,
 My Spirits dy'd away;
 Thy quick'ning Word new Vigour gave,
 Thy Voice commands my Stay. 

In my Distress to Thee I cry'd,
 When tossing in my Bed;
 Thou sent'st thy Mercy to my Aid,
 And eas'd my aking Head. 

Thou bidd'st the vital Current flow
 In a less rapid Tide;
 My dancing Pulse beat calm and low,
 And fev'rish Heats subside. 

Thou lend'st to my Physician Skill,
 Right Med'cines to apply;
 And my Disease obey'd thy Will,
 The painful Symptoms die. 

That Life, which thou hast longer spar'd,
 I would devote to Thee. 
O let thy Spirit be my Guard,
 Till I thy Face shall see!
