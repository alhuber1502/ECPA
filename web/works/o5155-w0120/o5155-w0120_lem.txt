Arisbe to Marius Junior.

from Fontenelle.

by the same.

i 

of all i value, all i love, bereave,
say, have my heart this little comfort leave?
that you the memory of its truth retain,
and think with grateful pity on my pain?

ii.

though but with life my sorrow can have end,
(for death alone can join i to my friend)
yet think not i repent i set you free,
i mourn your absence, not your liberty.

iii.

before my Marius leave numidia coast,
each day i see he; scarce a hour be lose:
now month and year must pass, nay life shall prove
but one long absence from the man i love.

iv.

painful reflection! poison to my mind!
be it but mortal too, it will be kind:
but mad with grief i search the palace round,
and in that madness dream you be to be find.

v. 

will thou believe it? to those wall i fly
where thou be captive hold; there frantic cry,
these fetter sure my vagrant flight restrain;
alas! these fetter i myself unchain.

vi.

the live-long day i mourn, i loath the light,
and wait impatient each return night:
what, though the horrid gloom augment my grief?
it be grateful still, for i disclaim relief.

vii.

that coz'ner hope intrude not on my woe;
one only interval my sorrow know;
when dream, the kind reverser of my pain,
bring back my charm fugitive again.

viii.

yet there be a grief surpass all the rest;
a jealous daemon whisper in my breast,
Marius be false, for liberty alone
the show of love the hypocrite put on.

ix.

then i reflect (ah! will i can forget!)
how much your thought on war and Rome be set.
how little passion do that conduct prove!
too strong thy reason, but too weak thy love.

x. 

thy sword, it be true, a father cause demand;
but it be a mistress give it to thy hand:
to love, and duty just, give each their part,
his be the arm, and i be all thy heart.

xi.

but what avail these thought? fond wretch, give over!
Marius, or false, or true, be thy no more:
since fate have cast the lot, and we must part,
why shall i wish to think i have his heart?

xii.

yes: let i cherish that remembrance still;
that think alone shall soften every ill;
to tell my soul, his love, his truth be such,
all be his due, nor have i do too much.

xiii.

deceitful comfort! let i not persuade
my credulous heart its fondness be repay;
it make my soul with double anguish mourn
those joy, which never, never must return.

xiv.

perhaps even you what most i wish oppose,
and in the roman all the lover lose:
i be a numidian, and your soul disdain
to bear the inglorious weight of foreign chain.

XV. 

can any climate then so barbarous prove,
to stand exclude from the law of love?
his empire universal, unconfined,
his proxy beauty, and his slave mankind.

xvi.

nor be i a numidian but by name,
for i can interest for my love disclaim:
my virtue show what it be the god design,
by chance on africk clay they stamp a roman mind.

xvii.

not all the hero which your Rome can boast,
so much for fame, as i for you have lose:
yourself i lose: oh! grateful, then confess,
my trial great, though my glory less.

xviii.

yes, partial god! inflicter of my care!
be witness what i feel, what grief, what fear!
when full of stifle woe the night he flee,
no sigh i dare to breathe, no tear to shed.

xix.

while man of faith approve, a choose crew,
firm to their trust, and to their mistress true,
with care too punctual my command obey,
and in one freight my life and thou convey.

xx.

the hard task be i; condemn to bear
with brow serene, my agonize care;
to mix in idle talk, to force a smile,
a king and jealous lover to beguile.

xxi.

think in that dreadful interval of fate,
all i hold dear, thy safety in debate,
think what i suffer, while my heart afraid
suggest a thousand time, that be all betray.

xxii.

a thousand time revolve in my mind
the doubtful chance; oh! love! say i, be kind:
propitious to my scheme, thy votary aid,
and be my fondness by success repay.

xxiii.

now bold grow, with sanguine hope elate,
my fancy represent thy smile fate;
the guard deceive, and every danger over,
the wind already waft he from the shore.

xxiv.

these please image anew impart
life to my eye, and gladness to my heart;
dispel the gloomy fear that cloud my face,
and charm the little flutterer to peace.

xxv.

but now the king, or tasteless to my charm,
or weary of a absent mistress arm,
his own apartment seek, and grateful rest;
that court stranger to the careful breast.

xxvi.

while i, by hope and fear alternate sway,
impatient ask the slave if i be obey.
it be do, they cry, and strike i with despair;
for what i long to know, i die to hear.

xxvii.

fantastic turn of a distract mind;
i blame the god for have be too kind;
curse the success they grant to my vow,
and this assistant hand that fill my woe.

xxviii.

such be my frenzy in that hour of care,
and such the injustice of my bold despair;
that even those, ungrateful i upbraid,
who fatal diligence my will obey.

xxix.

scarce, Marius, do thyself escape my rage;
(most love of man!) when fear of black presage
describe thy heart so fond of liberty,
it never give one part throb for i.

xxx.

at every step you shall have turn your eye,
drop a regretful tear, and heave a sigh;
the nature of the grace i show be such,
you not deserve it, if it please too much.

xxxi.

a lover will have linger as he flee,
and oft in anguish to himself have say,
farewell for ever! ah! yet more he will do,
a lover never will have flee alone.

xxxii.

to force i from a hate rival bed,
why come not Marius at a army head?
oh! do thy heart but wish to see that day,
it will all my past, and future woe overpay.

xxxiii.

but vain be all these hope: preserve thy breast
from falsehood only, i forgive the rest:
too happy, if not envy rival boast
those joy Arisbe for her marius lose.
