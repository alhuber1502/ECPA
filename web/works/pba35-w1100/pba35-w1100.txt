To Mrs. Mary CÆsar, upon seeing her just after the Marriage of her Friend, the Lady Margaret Harley.

I

I read in your delighted Face,
 The Nuptial Bands are ty'd:
 From me congratulate her Grace,
 Young Portland's lovely Bride. 

II

Tell her, an humble, artless Muse
 Would hail the happy Pair;
 But that, like Flow'rs by deadly Dews,
 Her Strains are damp'd by Care. 

III

Those whom the tuneful Nine inspire,
 Have now a spacious Field:
 To them I must resign the Lyre,
 To none in Wishes yield. 

IV

May Prudence still the Fair attend,
 Who, with distinguish'd Taste,
 In CÆsar early chose a Friend,
 With ev'ry Virtue grac'd:

V

Who back a thousand Years may trace,
 And her Descent maintain,
 From Ademar's illustrious Race,
 Ally'd to Charlemain.
