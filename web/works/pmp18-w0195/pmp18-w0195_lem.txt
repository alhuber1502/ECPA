a ode. present to the king, on his majesty arrival in holland, after the queen death. 1695.  

i 

at Mary tomb, (sad, sacred place!) 
the virtue shall their vigil keep:
 and every muse, and every grace
 in solemn state shall ever weep. 

ii.

the future, pious, mournful fair,
 oft as the roll year return,
 with fragrant wreath, and flow hair,
 shall visit her distinguish urn. 

iii.

for her the wise and great shall mourn;
 when late record her deed repeat:
 age to come, and man unborn
 shall bless her name, and sigh her fate. 

iv.

fair Albion shall, with faithful trust,
 her holy queen sad relic guard;
 until heaven awake the precious dust,
 and give the saint her full reward. 

v. 

but let the king dismiss his woe,
 reflect on his fair renown;
 and take the cypress from his brow,
 to put his wonted laurel on. 

vi.

if press by grief our monarch stoop;
 in vain the british lion roar:
 if he, who hand sustain they, droop;
 the belgic dart will wound no more. 

vii.

embattle prince wait the chief,
 who voice shall rule, who arm shall lead;
 and, in kind murmur, chide that grief,
 which hinder Europe be free. 

viii.

the great example they demand,
 who still to conquest lead the way;
 wish he present to command,
 as they stand ready to obey. 

ix.

they seek that joy, which use to glow,
 expand on the hero face;
 when the thick squadron press the foe,
 and William lead the glorious chace. 

x. 

to give the mourn nation joy,
 restore they thy auspicious light,
 great sun: with radiant beam destroy
 those cloud, which keep thou from our sight. 

xi.

let thy sublime meridian course
 for Mary set ray atone:
 our lustre, with redouble force,
 must now proceed from thou alone. 

xii.

see, pious king, with different strife
 thy struggle albion bosom tear:
 so much she fear for William life,
 that Mary fate she dare not mourn. 

xiii.

her beauty, in thy soft half
 bury and lose, she ought to grieve:
 but let her strength in thou be safe:
 and let she weep; but let she live. 

xiv.

thou, guardian angel, save the land
 from thy own grief, her fierce foe;
 lest Britain, rescue by thy hand,
 shall bend and sink beneath thy woe. 

XV. 

her former triumph all be vain,
 unless new trophy still be seek;
 and hoary majesty sustain
 the Battels, which thy youth have fight. 

xvi.

where now be all that fearful love,
 which make her hate the war alarm? 
that soft excess, with which she strive
 to keep her hero in her arm? 

xvii.

while still she chide the come spring,
 which call he over his subject sea:
 while, for the safety of the king,
 she wish the victor glory less. 

xviii.

it be change: it be go: sad Britain now
 hasten her lord to foreign war:
 happy! if toil may break his woe;
 or danger may divert his care. 

xix.

in martial din she drown her sigh,
 lest he the rise grief shall hear:
 she pull her helmet over her eye,
 lest he shall see the fall tear. 

xx.

go, mighty prince, let France be teach,
 how constant mind by grief be try;
 how great the land, that weep and fight,
 when William lead, and mary die. 

xxi.

fierce in the battle make it know,
 where death with all his dart be see,
 that he can touch thy heart with none,
 but that which strike the beauteous queen. 

xxii.

belgia indulge her open grief,
 while yet her master be not near;
 with sullen pride refuse relief,
 and sit obdurate in despair. 

xxiii.

as Waters from her sluice, flow
 unbounded sorrow from her eye:
 to earth her bend front she bow,
 and send she wail to the sky. 

xxiv.

but when her anxious lord return;
 raise be her head; her eye be dry:
 she smile, as William never have mourn:
 she look, as mary never have die. 

xxv.

that freedom which all sorrow claim,
 she do for thy content resign:
 her piety itself will blame;
 if her regret shall waken thy. 

xxvi.

to cure thy woe, she show thy fame;
 lest the great mourner shall forget,
 that all the race, whence orange come,
 make virtue triumph over fate. 

xxvii.

William his country be cause can fight,
 and with his blood her freedom seal:
 Maurice and Henry guard that right,
 for which their pious parent fall. 

xxviii.

how hero rise, how patriot set,
 thy father bloom and death may tell:
 excel other these be great:
 thou, great still, must these excel. 

xxix.

the last fair instance thou must give,
 whence nassau virtue can be try;
 and show the world, that thou can live
 intrepid, as thy consort die. 

xxx.

thy virtue, who resistless force
 no dire event can ever stay,
 must carry on it be destine course;
 though death and envy stop the way. 

xxxi.

for britain sake, for belgia, live:
 pierce by their grief forget thy own:
 new toil endure; new conquest give;
 and bring they ease, though thou have none. 

xxxii.

vanquish again; though she be go,
 who garland crown the victor hair:
 and reign; though she have leave the throne,
 who make thy glory worth thy care. 

xxxiii.

fair Britain never yet before
 breathe to her king a useless prayer:
 fond belgia never do implore,
 while William turn averse his ear. 

xxxiv.

but shall the weep hero now
 relentless to their wish prove;
 shall he recall, with please woe,
 the object of his grief and love;

XXXV. 

her face with thousand beauty bless,
 her mind with thousand virtue store,
 her power with boundless joy confess,
 her person only not adore:

xxxvi 

yet ought his sorrow to be check;
 yet ought his passion to abate:
 if the great mourner will reflect,
 her glory in her death complete. 

xxxvii.

she be instruct to command,
 great king, by long obey thou:
 her sceptre, guide by thy hand,
 preserve the isle, and rule the sea. 

xxxviii.

but oh! it be little, that her life
 over earth and water bear thy fame:
 in death, it be worthy William wife,
 amid the star to fix his name. 

xxxix.

beyond where matter move, or place
 receive it be form, thy virtue roll:
 from Mary glory, angel trace
 the beauty of her partner soul. 

XL. 

wise fate, which do it be heaven decree
 to hero, when they yield their breath,
 hasten thy triumph. half of thou
 be deify before thy death. 

xli 

alone to thy renown it be give,
 unbounded through all world to go:
 while she great saint rejoice heaven;
 and thou sustain the orb below.
