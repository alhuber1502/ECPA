fable [04] iv.

the eagle, and the assembly of animal.

as jupiter all-seeing eye
 survey the world beneath the sky,
 from this small speck of earth be send
 murmur and sound of discontent;
 for every thing alive complain
 that he the hard life sustain. 

Jove call his eagle. at the word
 before he stand the royal bird. 
the bird, obedient, from heaven height
 downward direct his rapid flight;
 then cite every live thing,
 to hear the mandate of his king. 

ungrateful creature, whence arise
 these murmur which offend the sky;
 why this disorder? say the cause:
 for just be Jove eternal law. 
let each his discontent reveal. 
to yond sour dog i first appeal. 

hard be my lot, the hound reply,
 on what fleet nerve the greyhound fly! 
while i with weary step and slow
 over plain and vale and mountain go;
 the morning see my chase begin,
 nor end it until the set sun. 

when (say the greyhound) i pursue,
 my game be lose, or catch in view,
 beyond my sight the prey secure:
 the hound be slow but always sure. 
and, have i his sagacious scent,
 Jove never have hear my discontent. 

the lion crave the fox art;
 the fox, the lion force and heart;
 the cock implore the pigeon flight,
 who wing be rapid, strong and light;
 the pigeon strength of wing despise,
 and the cock matchless valour prize:
 the fish wish to graze the plain,
 the beast to skim beneath the main. 
thus, envious of another state,
 each blame the partial hand of fate. 

the bird of heaven then cry aloud. 
Jove bid disperse the murmur crowd:
 the god reject your idle prayer. 
will you, rebellious mutineer,
 entire change your name and nature,
 and be the very envy creature? 
what, silent all, and none consent! 
be happy then, and learn content. 
nor imitate the restless mind,
 and proud ambition of mankind.
