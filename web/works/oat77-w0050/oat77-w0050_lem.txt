the search.

i 

confess ingenuous o man,
the upshot of thy toil and pain,
the product of thy brain;
since first thy busy race begin.
can thou produce one evidence,
or plausible pretence,
thy boast reason to evince?
yes — gradual each age have be refine
by the important labour of mankind;
the labour of their hand, and of their mind,
even wily nature, with her protean shape,
rare from their inquisitive search escape;
long she resist; but strict press,
resign the arcana of her Brest.
bold mortal Rob with ease
her rich cosser, be they lay
deep in the recess of profound sea,
or to the cavern of the earth convey;
for rather than live poor,
they will dive in quest of gem that sleep
on bed of rock beneath the deep,
and travel under-ground for golden-oar.

ii.

enough! — if we will lay claim,
from these performance, to fame,
where will the catalogue of our praise end?
for, thousand instance beside
will vindicate our pride,
and still the triumph of our wit extend.
such be the conquest which we daily gain
on learning undiscovered part:
our active fancy still create new art;
or, what be more,
even from the dead restore
art, that in age past have bury lie.
and yet it be fear, there be reason to suspect
our glory weight will fail,
and vanity prove the heavy scale:
impartial if we reflect,
we shall perceive there be want yet
the rich crown our tirumph to complete;
in vain we boast discovery,
whilst we return without the master prize;
the art of happiness still undiscovered lie.

iii.

oh happiness! (if happiness be ought
beside a wild Chimaera in the thought)
to what close nook be thou confine?
what distant continent or isle,
that thou can still beguile
the restless scrutiny of all mankind! 
even in this vale of misery,
some rivulet of bliss we taste;
but rivulet almost dry,
and taint with unsavoury ground through which they pass.
ah! that some friendly seraph will convey,
or point i out the way
to those glad land, where happiness flow pure;
where i may drink secure
at pleasure fountain-head;
no surfeit will i dread,
but quaff the cordial flood;
till mingle with my blood,
and circle through each part,
it shall like balsom ease my smart;
like nectar, cherish my deject heart!

iv.

in various way delude mortal toil,
all busy in the discovery of content:
this be the game we all pursue,
but hunt it still on a cold scent;
the wary prey never come in view,
but skulk aloof, and leave we at a foil. 
yet where be the disappoint man will say,
he now despair of being bless;
for though at present unpossessed
of his dear hope, he be yet in a fair way:
and now his project want but carry on as it be begin,
and then the important task be do:
do, say thou credulous man?
yes! so the Babel builder heretofore,
raise to heaven their proud tower, lack no more
than carry on the work as they begin.
but, grant thy year of drudgery be past,
it be odds but thou be impose upon at last:
thou like the syrian husbandman of old,
conceive thy self to hold
the beauteous Rachell fast in thy embrace,
yet (though th'imposture last a night)
be sure the next return light
shall fight thou with a unexpected face,
when thou behold a blear-eyed Leah in thy rachell place.
