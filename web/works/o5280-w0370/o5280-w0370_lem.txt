ode to tragedy.

to mrs. Siddons.

o hallow source of fancy woe,
 around thy shrine the stream that flow,
 from pity sacred source arise,
 now lose in horror, chill we gaze,
 and see thy hand the dagger raise;
 the fate victim die! 

where the pale body lifeless lie,
 sweet pity yield her throb sigh,
 and though deserve of the doom,
 yet fall he not without a tear,
 which, shed by virtue over his bier,
 bid hope dispel the gloom. 

when first the muse in grecia sing,
 to comic strain her shell she string,
 then please alone with shepherd lay;
 but O! when genius pour her light
 along the gloom of early night,
 to thou belong the praise. 

by every tragic bard of old,
 of who the historic page have tell;
 by every dear depart shade,
 by mighty Shakspeare honour dust,
 and by thy otway laureled bust;
 descend to earth, sweet maid. 

still briton feel thy glow rage,
 illume by shakespeare magic page;
 still over thy otway verse we mourn
 when impious cawdor guilty queen
 with murder stain the horrid scene. 
O! how our bosom burn. 

when fair Monimia weep plead,
 and when her hapless husband bleed,
 while tear bedim her radiant eye,
 sweet pity self descend there,
 attempt to soothe the hopeless fair
 with sympathetic sigh. 

when, catch frenzy from thy page,
 immortal Siddons tread the stage,
 the fairy stern awhile refrain,
 a while their scorpion lust restrain,
 and, please, behold the scene of woe. 
uncertain, if our tear and sigh,
 from true, or fancy ill arise;
 but, ah! the sweet delusion over,
 again they steep their snake in gore,
 and bid our sorrow flow.
