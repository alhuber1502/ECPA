to a wander husband, from a desert wife.

say, where be that charm repose
 that so late illumine my breast,
 like the sun that so cheerful shine,
 and at eve soothe i kind to rest? 

alas! it no long be i,
 no more on my morning it beam;
 despair now possess its place,
 and preside even over my dream. 

why do my fond credulous heart
 give delusion such easy belief;
 why listen with rapture to vow
 now forget, and devote i to grief? 

alas! whensoever i attempt
 a respite from anguish to find,
 from the world and its scorn i retire,
 still, still it adhere to my mind;

the admonish spirit within
 thy conscience must whisper, beware! 
haste — restore a fond wife to delight,
 a mother preserve from despair. 

the soft southern gale as it blow,
 appear with my sorrow to mourn;
 gentle echo with pity reply,
 "Mary peace never again can return." 

though religion meek aid i implore,
 yet the soft idea afire;
 and this heart, though disdain, still adore
 what my reason no long can prize. 

but alas! can the error be i? 
say, can it ever spring from my mind,
 when so fond thou often have say,
 Mary bosom be chaste and refine? 

still triumph — my wrong be unknown;
 oh! torture be hush, be repress;
 to be pity i yet be too proud,
 and thy fame be still dear to my breast;

ever dear! yet be warn by my love;
 retribution bright morning will rise,
 and those wrong, unremembered by thou,
 some angel will waft to the sky. 

farewell to each blessing below,
 my moment to care i resign;
 though i die, may thy pleasure increase! 
thy mary will never repine:

to the grave thy fond wife will retire,
 it will shelter — will yield her repose;
 its coldness will chill her warm heart,
 free thou — and her sorrow compose.
