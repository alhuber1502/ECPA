Corydon:

a pastoral.

to the memory of WILLIAM Shenstone, ESQ

by the same.

i 

come, shepherd, we will follow the hearse,
 we will see our love Corydon lay,
 though sorrow may blemish the verse,
 yet let a sad tribute be pay. 

they call he the pride of the plain;
 in sooth he be gentle and kind! 
he mark on his elegant strain
 the grace that glow in his mind. 

ii.

on purpose he plant yond tree,
 that bird in the covert may dwell;
 he culture his thyme for the bee,
 but never will rifle their cell. 

you lambkin that play at his foot,
 go bleat — and your master bemoan;
 his music be artless and sweet,
 his manner as mild as your own. 

iii.

no verdure shall cover the vale,
 no bloom on the blossom appear;
 the sweet of the forest shall fail,
 and winter discolour the year. 

no bird in our hedge shall sing,
 (our hedge so vocal before)
 since he that shall welcome the spring,
 can greet the gay season no more. 

iv.

his Phillis be fond of his praise,
 and poet come round in a throng;
 they listen, — they envy his lay,
 but which of they equal his song? 

you shepherd, henceforward be mute,
 for lose be the pastoral strain;
 so give i my corydon flute,
 and thus — let i break it in twain.
