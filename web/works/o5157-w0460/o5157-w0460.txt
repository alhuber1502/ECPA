Miss SOPER'S Answer to a Lady, who invited her to retire into a monastic Life at St. CROSS, near WINCHESTER.

I.

IN vain, mistaken maid, you'd fly
To desart and to shade;
But since you call, for once I'll try
How well your vows are made.

II.

To noise and cares let's bid adieu,
And solitude commend.
But how the world will envy you,
And pity me your friend!

III.

You, like rich metal hid in earth,
Each swain will dig to find;
But I expect no second birth,
For dross is left behind.
