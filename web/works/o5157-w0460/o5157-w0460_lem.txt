miss soper answer to a lady, who invite she to retire into a monastic life at saint cross, near Winchester.

i 

in vain, mistake maid, you will fly
to desert and to shade;
but since you call, for once i will try
how well your vow be make.

ii.

to noise and care let we bid adieu,
and solitude commend.
but how the world will envy you,
and pity i your friend!

iii.

you, like rich metal hide in earth,
each swain will dig to find;
but i expect no second birth,
for dross be leave behind.
