night scene of other time.

a poem, in three part.

part i 

 "the night wind bellow over my head
 dim grow the fade light;
 where shall i find some friendly shed
 to screen i from the night? 

 "ah! round i lie a desert vast,
 no habitation near;
 and dark and pathless be the waste
 and fill my mind with fear. 

 "thou distant tree, who lonely top
 have bend to many a storm,
 no more can thou deceive my hope
 and take my lover form;

 "for over thy head the dark cloud roll,
 dark as thy blast pride;
 how deep the angry tempest growl
 along the mountain side. 

 "safe within the shaggy brake
 be couch the mountain deer;
 a sound unbroken sleep they take;
 no haunt of man be near. 

 "beneath the fern the moorcock sleep,
 and twist adder lie;
 back to his rock the night-bird creep,
 nor give his wonted cry. 

 "for angry spirit of the night
 ride on the trouble air,
 and to their den, in strange affright,
 the beast of prey repair. 

 "but thou, my love! where do thou rest? 
what shelter cover thou? 
o may this cold and wintery blast
 but only beat on i! 

 "some friendly dwelling may thou find,
 where sleep may banish care
 and thou feel not the chilly wind
 that scatter Margaret hair. 

 "ah no! for thou do give thy word
 to meet i on the way:
 nor friendly roof nor social board
 will tempt a lover stay. 

 "o raise thy voice if thou be near! 
its weak sound be bliss;
 what other sound my heart can cheer
 in such a gloom as this? 

 "but from the hill with deafen roar
 the dash torrent fall,
 and heavy beat the drift shower,
 and mock a lover call. 

 "ha! see, across the dreary waste,
 a move form appear,
 it be my love, my care be past;
 how vain be all my fear!" 

the form advance, but sad and slow,
 not with a lover tread;
 and from his cheek the youthful glow
 and greeting smile be flee. 

dim sadness sit upon his brow;
 fix be his beamless eye;
 his face be like a moon-light bow
 upon a wintery sky. 

and fix and ghastly to the sight
 his strengthen feature rise,
 and bend be his graceful height,
 and bloody be his clothes. 

 "my Margaret, calm thy trouble breast;
 thy sorrow now be vain;
 thy Edward from his peaceful rest
 shall never return again. 

 "a treacherous friend have lay i low,
 have fix my early doom,
 and lay my corpse with feign woe
 beneath a vaunt tomb. 

 "to take thou to my home i swear,
 and here we be to meet;
 will thou a narrow coffin share,
 and part my wind sheet? 

 "but late the lord of many land,
 and now a grave be all:
 my blood be warm upon his hand
 who revel in my hall. 

 "yet think, thy father hoary hair
 be water with his tear;
 he have but thou to soothe his care,
 and prop his load of year. 

 "remember Edward when he be go
 he only live for thou;
 and when thou be pensive and alone
 dear Margaret, call on i! 

 "though deep beneath the moulder clod
 i rest my wound head,
 and terrible that call and loud
 which shall awake the dead!" 

 "no, Edward; i will follow thou,
 and share thy hapless doom;
 companion shall our spirit be,
 though distant be thy tomb. 

 "o! never to my father tower
 will i return again;
 a bleed heart have little power
 to ease another pain. 

 "upon the wing my spirit fly,
 i feel my course be run;
 nor shall these dim and weary eye
 behold tomorrow sun." 

like early dew, or hoary frost
 spend with the beam day,
 so shrink the pale and watery ghost,
 and dim wear away. 

no long Margaret feel the storm,
 she bow her lovely head,
 and, with her lover fleet form,
 her gentle spirit flee. 

part ii.

 "loud roar the wind that shake the wall,
 it be no common blast;
 deep hollow sound pass through my hall:
 o will the night be past! 

 "methinks the demon of the air
 upon the turret growl,
 while down the empty wind stair
 their deepen murmur roll. 

 "the glimmer fire cheer not the gloom,
 blue burn the quiver ray,
 and, like a taper in a tomb,
 but spread the more dismay. 

 "athwart its melancholy light
 the lengthen shadow fall;
 my grandsire to my trouble sight
 low on i from these wall. 

 "methinks yond angry warrior head
 do in its panel frown,
 and dart a look, as if it say,
 'where have thou lay my son?' 

 "but will these fancy never cease? 
o will the night be run! 
my trouble soul can find no peace
 but with the morning sun,

 "vain hope! the guilty never rest;
 dismay be always near;
 there be a midnight in the breast
 no morn shall ever cheer. 

 "now sound sleep the weary hind,
 though lowly lie his head;
 a easy lair the guiltless find
 upon the hard bed. 

 "the beggar, in his wretched haunt,
 may now a monarch be;
 forget his woe, forget his want,
 for all can sleep but i. 

 "I have dare whatever the bold can,
 then why this childish dread? 
i never fear a live man,
 and shall i fear the dead? 

 "no; whistle blast may shake my tower,
 and pass spirit scream:
 their shadowy arm be void of power,
 and but a gloomy dream. 

 "but, lo! a form advance slow
 across the dusky hall,
 be thou a friend? — be thou a foe? 
o answer to my call!" 

still near to the glimmer light
 the stately figure stride,
 till full, and horrid to the sight,
 the murder Edward stand. 

a break shaft his right hand sway,
 like time be dark, threaten dart,
 and point to a rugged blade
 that quiver in his heart. 

the blood still trickle from his head,
 and clot be his hair;
 his sever vesture stain and red;
 his mangle breast be bare. 

his face be like a muddy sky
 before the come snow;
 and dark and dreadful be his eye,
 and cloudy be his brow. 

pale Conrad shrink, but draw his sword —
 fear thrill in every vein;
 his quiver lip give out no word;
 he pause, and shrink again. 

then utterance come — "at this dread hour
 why do thou haunt the night? 
have the deep gloomy vault no power
 to keep thou from my sight? 

 "why do thou glare and slow wave
 that fatal shaft of strife? 
the deed be do, and from the grave
 who can recall to life? 

 "why roll thy eye beneath thy brow
 dark as the midnight storm? 
what do thou want? o let i know,
 but hide thy dreadful form. 

 "i will give the lifeblood from my heart
 to wash my crime away:
 if thou a spirit art, depart,
 nor haunt a wretch of clay! 

 "say, do thou with the bless dwell? —
 return and bless be! 
or come thou from the low hell? —
 i be more curse than thou." 

the form advance with solemn step
 as if it mean to speak,
 and seem to move its pallid lip,
 but silence do not break. 

then stern stalk with heavy pace
 which shake the floor and wall,
 and turn away its fearful face,
 and vanish from the hall. 

transfix and powerless, Conrad stand;
 ear ring, and eyeball swell;
 back to his heart run the cold blood;
 into a trance he fall. 

night flee, and through the window begin
 the early light to play;
 but on a more unhappy man
 never shine the dawn day. 

the gladsome sun all nature cheer,
 but can charm his care;
 still dwell his mind with gloomy fear,
 and murder Edward glare. 

part iii.

 "no rest nor comfort can i find:
 i watch the midnight hour;
 i sit and listen to the wind
 that beat upon my tower. 

 "methinks low voice from the ground
 break mournful on my ear,
 and through these empty chamber sound
 so dismal and so drear! 

 "the ghost of some depart friend
 do in my sorrow share;
 or be it but the rush wind
 that mock my despair? 

 "sad through the hall the pale lamp gleam
 upon my father arm;
 my soul be fill with gloomy dream,
 i fear unknown alarm. 

 "o, i have know this lonely place
 with every blessing store,
 and many a friend with cheerful face
 sit smile at my board! 

 "while round the hearth, in early bloom,
 my harmless child play,
 who now within the narrow tomb
 be with their mother lay. 

 "now sad bend my wretched head,
 and those i love be go:
 my friend, my family, all be flee,
 and i be leave alone. 

 "oft as the cheerless fire decline,
 in it i sad trace,
 as lone i sit, the half-formed line
 of many a much-loved face. 

 "but chief, Margaret, to my mind,
 thy lovely feature rise;
 i strive to think thou less unkind,
 and wipe my stream eye. 

 "for only thou i have to vaunt,
 thou be thy mother pride;
 she leave thou like a shoot plant,
 to screen my widow side. 

 "but thou forsake i, weak, forlorn,
 and chill with age frost,
 to count my weary day and mourn
 the comfort i have lose. 

 "unkind child! why do thou go? 
o, have i know the truth! 
though Edward father be my foe,
 i will have bless the youth. 

 "can i but see that face again,
 who smile calm every strife,
 and hear that voice which soothe my pain,
 and make i wish for life! 

 "thy harp hang silent by the wall:
 my night be sad and long,
 and thou be in a distant hall,
 where stranger raise the song. 

 "ha! some delusion of the mind
 my sense do confound! 
it be the harp, and not the wind,
 that do so sweet sound." 

old Arno rise all wan as death,
 and turn his eager ear,
 and check the while his quicken breath
 the sound again to hear. 

when like a full, but distant choir,
 the swell note return;
 and with the soft tremble wire
 surround echo mourn;

then soft whisper over the song
 that Margaret love to play,
 its wellknown measure linger long,
 and faint die away. 

his dim-worn eye to heaven he cast,
 where all his grief be know,
 and smite upon his trouble breast,
 and heave a heavy groan. 

 "i know it be my daughter hand,
 but it be no hand of clay;
 and here a lonely wretch i stand,
 all childless, bend, and grey. 

 "and be thou low, my lovely child,
 and have thou meet thy doom,
 and have thy flatter morning smile,
 to lead but to the tomb? 

 "o let i see thou ere we part,
 for soul like thy be bless;
 o let i fold thou to my heart,
 if aught of form thou have! 

 "this pass mist conceal thy shape,
 but it be shrink or fly;
 why do thou from my arm escape,
 be thou not still my own? 

 "thou be flee like the low evening breath,
 that sigh upon the hill:
 o stay! though in thy weed of death, —
 thou be my daughter still." 

loud wake the sound, then faint grow,
 and long and sad mourn,
 and soft sigh a long adieu,
 and never more return. 

old Arno stretch he on the ground;
 thick as the gloom of night,
 death misty shadow gather round,
 and swim before his sight. 

he heave a deep and deadly groan,
 that rend his labour breast,
 and long before the morning shine,
 his spirit be at rest.
