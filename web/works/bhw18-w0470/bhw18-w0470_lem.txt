to mrs. K—,

on her send i english christmas plumb-cake, at Paris.

what crowd thought around i wake,
 what marvel in a christmas-cake! 
ah say, what strange enchantment dwell
 enclose within its odorous cell? 
be there no small magician bind
 encrust in its snowy round? 
for magic sure lurk in this,
 a cake that tell of vanish bliss;
 a cake that conjure up to view
 the early scene, when life be new;
 when memory know no sorrow past,
 and hope believe in joy that last! —
 mysterious cake, who fold contain
 life calendar of bliss and pain;
 that speak of friend for ever flee,
 and wake the tear i love to shed. 
oft shall i breathe her cherish name
 from who fair hand the offer come:
 for she recall the artless smile
 of nymph that deck my native isle;
 of beauty that we love to trace,
 ally with tender, modest grace;
 of those who, while abroad they roam,
 retain each charm that gladden home,
 and who dear friendship can impart
 a christmas banquet for the heart!
