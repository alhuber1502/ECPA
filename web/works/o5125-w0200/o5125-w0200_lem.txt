a prayer for the year, 1745. 

almighty wisdom, at who nod
 the star shall cease to shine,
 great nature father, guide, and god,
 o let i call thou i. 

yet not for i, and i alone,
 thy mercy i implore:
 no, let that bliss to all be know,
 that tremble and adore. 

now fear, that make the sorrow flow
 even from the infant eye,
 overwhelm in one promiscuous woe
 the ignorant and wise. 

then hear, o hear, thy servant cry,
 we beg thy save hand:
 to who but heaven shall we apply,
 to raise a droop land! 

be thou the guard of helpless age,
 the wretched orphan friend:
 o smooth the face of hostile rage,
 and spare its purple end. 

restrain the hand of threaten pride,
 assuage the cruel breast:
 teach mercy to the victor side,
 and patience to the rest. 

and when the sword of conquest shall
 the tremble wretch arraign,
 let justice guide the equal scale,
 nor swerve the steady beam. 

preserve the merciful and kind
 from violence and pain:
 and let the meek and gentle mind
 rejoice, and not complain. 

nor let the barbarous steel invade
 the breast of hoary age:
 nor give the unresisting babe
 a prey to purple rage. 

among unnumbered world if i
 be worth my maker care,
 then let i live and let i die
 unwounded by despair. 

though want or peril, pain or death,
 assault this feeble clay,
 let hope attend my late breath
 and cheer the gloomy way. 

preserve my parent and my friend
 from danger, guilt or shame:
 in peace their cheerful day extend
 to praise thy holy name. 

forgive the error of my youth,
 if in my youth i fall:
 or teach my age thy save truth,
 o hear i when i call. 

thou mighty lord of all above
 and all beneath the sun,
 thy servant humble suit approve;
 if not, thy will be do.
