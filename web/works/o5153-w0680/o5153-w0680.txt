By the Same.

THE potent Lord, that this bright villa plann'd,
Exhibits here a Paradise regain'd;
Whate'er of Verdure have Hills, Lawns, or Woods,
Whate'er of Splendor, Buildings, Flow'rs, or Floods,
Whate'er of Fruits the Trees, of Birds the Air,
In blissful union are collected here:
All with such harmony dispos'd, as shews,
That in the midst the Tree of Knowledge grows.
