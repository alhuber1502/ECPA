Written for Her Niece S. K.

SWEETEST! if thy fairy hand
 Culls for me the latest flowers,
 Smiling hear me thus demand
 Blessings for thy early hours:

Be thy promised spring as bright
 As its opening charms foretel;
 Graced with Beauty's lovely light,
 Modest Virtue's dearer spell. 

Be thy summer's matron bloom
 Blest with blossoms sweet like thee;
 May no tempest's sudden doom
 Blast thy hope's fair nursery! 

May thine autumn calm, serene,
 Never want some lingering flower,
 Which affection's hand may glean,
 Though the darkling mists may lower! 

Sunshine cheer thy wintry day,
 Tranquil conscience, peace, and love;
 And thy wintry nights display
 Streams of glorious light above.
