epigram ix.

on one who first abuse, and then make love to a lady.

foul — with graceless verse,
the noble — dare asperse.
but when he see she well bespatter,
her reputation stain and tatter;
he gaze and love the hideous elf,
she look so very like himself.
true sing the bard well know to fame,
selflove and social be the same.
