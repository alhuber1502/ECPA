EPIGRAM IX.

On one who first abused, and then made love to a LADY.

FOUL — with graceless verse,
The noble — dar'd asperse.
But when he saw her well bespatter'd,
Her reputation stain'd and tatter'd;
He gaz'd and lov'd the hideous elf,
She look'd so very like himself.
True sung the bard well known to fame,
Self-love and social are the same.
