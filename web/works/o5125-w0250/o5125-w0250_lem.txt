the fox and the hen.

a fable.

it be on a fair and healthy plain,
 there live a poor but honest Swain,
 have to his lot a little ground,
 defend by a quickset mound:
 it be there he milk his brindle kine,
 and there he feed his harmless swine:
 he pigeon flutter to and fro,
 and bask his poultry in a row:
 much we may say of each of these,
 as how his pig in consort wheeze;
 how the sweet hay his heifer chew,
 and how the pigeon soft coo:
 but we shall wave this motley strain,
 and keep to one that be short and plain:
 nor paint the dunghill feather king,
 for of the hen we mean to sing. 

a hen there be, a strange one too,
 can sing (believe i, it be true)
 or rather (as you may presume)
 will prate and cackle in a tune:
 this quick spread the pullet fame,
 and bird and beast together come:
 all mix in one promiscuous throng,
 to visit Partlet and her song. 
it chance there come among the crew,
 of witty fox not a few:
 but one more smart than all the rest,
 his serious neighbour thus address:
'what think you of this Partlet here? 
'it be true her voice be pretty clear:
'yet without pause i can tell,
'in what much more she will excel:
'methinks she will eat exceed well. 
this hear the listen hen, as she
 sit perch upon a maple-tree. 

the shrewd proposal gall her pride,
 and thus to Reynard she reply:
'sir, you be extreme right i vow,
'but how will you come at i now? 
'you dare not mount this lofty tree,
'so there i be pretty safe, you see. 
'from long ago, (or record lie)
'you fox have be count wise:
'but sure this story do agree
'with your device of eat i. 
'for you, dame fortune still intend
'some coarse food than sing hen:
'beside ever you can reach so high,
'remember you must learn to fly. 
'i own it be but a scurvy way,
'you have as yet to seize your prey,
'by skulk from the beam of light,
'and rob hen-roosts in the night:
'yet you must keep this vulgar trade
'of thieve till your wing be make. 

'have i the keep of you though,
'i will make your subtle worship know,
'we chicken be your better due,
'not fat up for such as you:
'shut up in cub with rusty chain,
'i will make you lick your lip in vain:
'and take a special care, be sure,
'no pullet shall come near your door:
'but try if you can feed or not,
'upon a kite or carrion Crow.' 
here cease the hen. the baffle beast
 march off without his promise feast.
