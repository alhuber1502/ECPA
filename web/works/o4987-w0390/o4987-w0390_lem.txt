winter prospect in the country.

a epistle to a friend in LONDON, 1756. 

by J. S. 

while learning please care my friend detain,
 by thames bank on London smoky plain;
 where spacious street their people length extend,
 and pompous dome and lofty spire ascend:
 far different view the lonely country yield,
 desert road, and unfrequented field;
 bleak scene, where hoary winter hold command,
 and from his throne of cloud overlook the land;
 he frown â€” the power of vegetation die,
 frost bind the earth, and tempest rend the sky;
 or drive snow descend, or pour rain,
 or chill vapour hover over the plain. 
sometime awhile the hoary tyrant sleep,
 hide in his cave beneath the watery deep;
 the distant sun extend a cheere ray,
 bright smile the sky and soft the breeze play:
 then airy lawn the morning walk invite,
 and rural landscape charm the rove sight,
 mix with brown stubble, leafless wood be see,
 and neat-ploughed furrow clad in scanty green;
 while turbid water edge with yellow reed
 wind through the russet herd-forsaken mead;
 and grove that winter fierce rage disdain
 in fair plantation deck the shelter plain:
 there paint holly with red berry glow,
 and their broad leaf the shine laurel show,
 and pine and fir their vary verdure blend,
 and cedar spread, and cypress ascend. 
please with the scene, i range from field to field,
 till lofty land remot prospect yield;
 and there the curious optic tube apply
 till a new world approach on the eye;
 till where dark wood the hill slope surface shroud;
 or the blue summit mingle with the cloud;
 there fair enclosure lie of vary hue,
 and tree and house rise distinct to view. 

but this too oft the inclement clime deny,
 involve in misty or in watery sky;
 and yet even then with book engage, i find
 a sweet employment for the explore mind;
 there fair description show each absent scene,
 the corn-clad mountain and the daisy green;
 there over distant land my fancy rove,
 through india cany isle and palmy grove;
 where clear stream wander through luxuriant vale,
 midst cloudless sky and ever-tepid gale,
 while spring sit smile in her bright bloom,
 and call around her every rich perfume.
