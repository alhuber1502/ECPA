THE HAPPY SAINT AND Cursed Sinner.

PSALM I.

I.

BLEST is the Man, whose cautious Feet
 Shun the broad Path which Sinners chuse,
 Who hates the House where Atheists meet,
 And dreads the Words that Scoffers use. 

II.

He loves t' employ his Morning Light
 Reading the Statutes of the Lord,
 And spends the wakeful Hours of Night
 With Pleasure pond'ring o're the Word. 

III.

He like a Plant by gentle Streams
 Shall Flourish in Immortal Green;
 And Heav'n will shine with Kindest Beams
 On every Work his Hands begin. 

IV.

But Sinners find their Counsels cross'd:
 As Chaff before the Tempest flies,
 So shall their Hopes be blown and lost
 When the last Trumpet shakes the Skies. 

V.

In vain the Rebel crouds to stand
 In Judgment with the Pious Race;
 The dreadful Judge with Stern Command
 Divides him to a different Place. 

VI.

 "Strait is the Way my Saints have trod,
" I blest the Path and drew it plain:
 "But you would chuse the crooked Road,
" And it leads down t' Eternal Pain.
