the descent of Odin:

a ode.

by the same.

uprise the king of man with speed,
 and saddle strait his coalblack steed;
 down the yawn steep he ride,
 that lead to hela drear abode. 
he the dog of darkness spy,
 his shaggy throat he open wide,
 while from his jaw, with carnage fill,
 foam and human gore distil:
 hoarse he bay with hideous din,
 eye that glow, and fang that grin;
 and long pursue, with fruitless yell,
 the father of the powerful spell. 
onward still his way he take,
 (the groan earth beneath he shake,)
 till full before his fearless eye
 the portal nine of hell arise. 

right against the eastern gate,
 by the moss-grown pile he sit;
 where long of yore to sleep be lay
 the dust of the prophetic maid. 
face to the northern clime,
 thrice he trace the runic rhyme;
 thrice pronounce, in accent dread,
 the thrill verse that wake the dead;
 till from out the hollow ground
 slow breathe a sullen sound. 

pr.

what call unknown, what charm presume
 to break the quiet of the tomb? 
who thus afflict my trouble sprite,
 and drag i from the realm of night? 
long on these moulder bone have beat
 the winter snow, the summer heat,
 the drench dew, and drive rain! 
let i, let i sleep again. 
who be he, with voice unblest,
 that call i from the bed of rest? 

O. 

a traveller, to thou unknown,
 be he that call, a warrior son. 
thou the deed of light shall know;
 tell i what be do below,
 for who yond glitter board be spread,
 dress for who yond golden bed. 

pr.

mantl in the goblet see
 the pure beverage of the bee,
 over it hang the shield of gold;
 it be the drink of bald bold:
 balder head to death be give. 
pain can reach the son of heaven! 
unwilling i my lip unclose:
 leave i, leave i to repose. 

O. 

once again my call obey. 
prophetess, arise, and say,
 what danger odin child await,
 who the author of his fate. 

pr.

in hoder hand the hero doom:
 he brother send he to the tomb. 
now my weary lip i close:
 leave i, leave i to repose. 

O. 

prophetess, my spell obey,
 once again arise, and say,
 who the avenger of his guilt,
 by who shall hoder blood be spill. 

pr.

in the cavern of the west,
 by odin fierce embrace compress,
 a wondrous boy shall rinda bear,
 who never shall comb his raven-hair,
 nor wash his visage in the stream,
 nor see the sun depart beam;
 till he on hoder corpse shall smile
 flame on the funeral pile. 
now my weary lip i close:
 leave i, leave i to repose. 

O. 

yet a while my call obey. 
prophetess, awake, and say,
 what virgin these, in speechless woe,
 that bend to earth their solemn brow,
 that their flaxen tress tear,
 and snowy veil, that float in air. 
tell i whence their sorrow rise:
 then i leave thou to repose. 

pr.

ha! no traveller be thou,
 king of man! i know thou now,
 mighty of a mighty line â€”

O. 

no bode maid of skill divine
 art thou, nor prophetess of good;
 but mother of the giant-brood! 

pr.

hie thou hence, and boast at home,
 that never shall enquirer come
 to break my iron-sleep again;
 till lok have burst his tenfold chain. 
never, till substantial night
 have reassume her ancient right;
 till wrap in flame, in ruin hurl,
 sink the fabric of the world.
