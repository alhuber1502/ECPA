sonnet

to hope. 

o, ever skill to wear the form we love! 
to bid the shape of fear and grief depart;
 come, gentle hope! with one gay smile remove
 the last sadness of a ache heart. 
thy voice, benign enchantress! let i hear;
 say that for i some pleasure yet shall bloom, —
 that fancy radiance, friendship precious tear,
 shall soften, or shall chase, misfortune gloom. 
but come not glow in the dazzle ray,
 which once with dear illusion charm my eye, —
 o! strew no more, sweet flatterer! on my way
 the flower i fond think too bright to die;
 vision less fair will soothe my pensive breast,
 that ask not happiness, but long for rest!
