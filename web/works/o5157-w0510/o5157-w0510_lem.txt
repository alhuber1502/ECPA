to chlorinda.

by the same.

see, Strephon, what unhappy fate
do on thy fruitless passion wait,
add to flame fresh fuel:
rather than thou shall favour find;
the kind soul on earth unkind,
and the best nature cruel.

the goodness, which chlorinda show,
from mildness and good breed flow,
but must not love be style:
or else it be such as mother try,
when weary with incessant cry,
they still a froward child.

she with a graceful mien and air,
gent civil, yet severe,
bid thou all hope give over.
friendship she offer, pure and free;
and who, with such a friend as she,
can want, or wish for more?

the cur that swim along the flood,
his mouth well fill with morsel good,
(too good for common cur!)
by visionary hope betray,
gape to catch a fleet shade,
lose what he hold before.

Mark, Strephon, and apply this tale,
lest love and friendship both shall fail;
where then will be thy hope?
of hope, quoth Strephon, talk not, friend;
and for apply â€” know, the end
of every cur a rope.
