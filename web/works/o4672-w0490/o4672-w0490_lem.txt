to mr. C. and S. Fleetwood. 

the world vain and the soul immortal.

i 

fleetwoods, young generous pair,
 despise the joy that fool pursue;
 bubble be light and brittle too,
 bear of the water and the air. 
try by a standard bold and just
 honour and gold be paint and dust;
 how vile the last be, and as vain the first:
 thing that the crowd call great and brave,
 with i how low their valve's bring! 
title, and name, and life, and breath,
 slave to the wind and bear for death;
 the soul the only thing we have
 worth an important thought. 

ii.

the soul! it be of the immortal kind,
 not form of fire, or earth, or wind,
 outlive the moulder corpse, and leave the globe behind. 
in limb of clay though she appear,
 dress up in ear and eye,
 the flesh be but the soul disguise,
 there be nothing in her frame kin to the rag she wear. 
from all the law of matter free,
 from all we feel, and all we see
 she stand eternal distinct, and must for ever be. 

iii.

rise then, my thought, on high,
 soar beyond all that be make to die;
 lo! on a awful throne
 sit the creator and the judge of soul,
 whirl the planet round the pole,
 wind off our thread of life, and bring our period on. 
swift the approach, and solemn be the day,
 when this immortal mind
 strip of the body coarse array
 to endless pain, or endless joy
 must be at once consign. 

iv.

think of the sand run down to waste,
 we possess none of all the past,
 none but the present be our own;
 grace be not place within our power,
 it be but one short, one shine hour,
 bright and decline as a set sun. 
see the white minute winge with have;
 the now that fly may be the last,
 seize the salvation ever it be past,
 nor mourn the bless go:
 a thought delay be ruin here,
 a close eye, a gasp breath
 shut up the golden scene in death,
 and drown you in despair.
