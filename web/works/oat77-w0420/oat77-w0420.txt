On Snow fall'n in Autumn, and dissolv'd by the Sun.

I.

NAture now stript of all her Summer-Dress,
And modestly surmizing, 'twere unmeet
For each rude Eye to view her Nakedness;
Around her bare Limbs wraps this Snowy Sheet. 

II.

The wanton Sun the slight-wrought Shroud removes
T'embrace the naked Dame, whose fertile Womb
Admits the lusty Paramour's warm Love's,
And is made big with the fair Spring to come.
