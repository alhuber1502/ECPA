SONG.

By the Same.

AS o'er Asteria's fields I rove,
The blissful seat of peace and love,
Ten thousand beauties round me rise,
And mingle pleasure with surprize.

By nature blest in every part,
Adorn'd with every grace of art,
This paradise of blooming joys
Each raptur'd sense, at once, employs.

II.

But when I view the radiant queen,
Who form'd this fair enchanting scene;
Pardon ye grots! ye crystal floods!
Ye breathing flow'rs! ye shady woods!

Your coolness now no more invites;
No more your murmuring stream delights;
Your sweets decay, your verdure's flown;
My soul's intent on her alone.
