the lily triumph over the rose.

the rose, i own, have many a charm
 to win the partial eye;
 her sweet remain to glad the sense
 even when her colour fly:
 just so good humour charm the heart,
 after a face once fair
 part with its bloom, and wither time
 have plant wrinkle there. 
but shall i ask from beauty store
 a tint to gain the heart,
 it shall not be the bloom tinge
 which look so like to art. 
no; spread along the downy cheek
 the tender lily fair,
 and soon the eye shall teach the heart
 to find a interest there. 
the bend form, the droop head,
 shall dwell upon the mind,
 and ever round the feeling strong
 some soft affection wind. 
so Flora, once in pensive mood,
 pronounce the fix decree,
 when pass many a flaunt flower,
 she drop a tear over thou;
 "other," say she, "may charm the eye,
 and fancy joy impart;
 but thou shall learn the secret way
 that win into the heart. 
within thy bell this pearl shall rest,
 which seem a lucid tear,
 the only gem that pity love
 to tremble in her ear. 
then let health make the bloom rose
 the favourite of her bower; â€”
 the eye may woo the floweret gay,
 the heart shall own thy power.
