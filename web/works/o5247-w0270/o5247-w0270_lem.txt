a ode.

i 

ah cease to grieve, fond flutter heart,
 thy charm conqueror return;
 hence every doubt each fear depart,
 the youth with equal passion burn. 

ii.

haste, gentle wind, and waft he here,
 nor long my love Philander keep;
 grant, queen of love, a lover prayer,
 sooth into smile thy native deep. 

iii.

while i thy gentle power address,
 view the dear object of my care;
 view he, bright goddess, and confess
 a lovely Adonis there. 

iv.

then can my vow be fruitless pay,
 when in that love-inspiring form;
 those melt grace be display,
 which your celestial breast can warm. 

v. 

come then, my soul enslaver, come,
 to these fond eye their bliss restore;
 be these encircle arm thy home,
 and fate shall never part we more.
