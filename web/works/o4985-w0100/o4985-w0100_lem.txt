the manner. a ode.

by the same.

farewell, for clear ken design,
 the dim-discovered tract of mind:
 truth which, from action path retire,
 my silent search in vain require! 
no more my sail that deep explore,
 no more i search those magic shore,
 what region part the world of soul,
 or whence thy stream, opinion, roll:
 if ever i round such fairy field,
 some power impart the spear and shield,
 at which the wizard passion fly,
 by which the giant folly die! 

farewell the porch, who roof be see,
 arch with the enliven olive green:
 where science prank in tissue vest,
 by reason, pride, and fancy dress,
 come like a bride, so trim array,
 to wed with doubt in Plato shade! 

youth of the quick uncheated sight,
 thy walk, observance, more invite! 
o thou, who love that ampler range,
 where life be wide prospect round thou change,
 and, with her mingle son ally,
 throw the prattle page aside:
 to i in converse sweet impart,
 to read in man the native heart,
 to learn, where science sure be find,
 from nature as she live around:
 and gaze oft her mirror true,
 by turn each shift image view! 
till meddle art officious lore
 reverse the lesson teach before,
 allure from a safe rule,
 to dream in her enchant school;
 thou heaven, whatever of great we boast,
 have bless this social science most. 

retire hence to thoughtful cell,
 as fancy breathe her potent spell,
 not vain she find the charmful task,
 in pageant quaint, in motley mask,
 behold, before her muse eye,
 the countless manner round she rise;
 while ever vary as they pass,
 to some contempt apply her glass:
 with these the white-robed maid combine,
 and those the laugh satyr join! 
but who be he who now she view,
 in robe of wild contend hue? 
thou, by the passion nurse; i greet
 the comic sock that bind thy foot! 
o humour, thou who name be know
 to britain favour isle alone;
 i too amid thy band admit,
 there where the young-eyed healthful wit,
 (who jewel in his crisp hair
 be place each other beam to share,
 who no delight from thou divide)
 in laughter loose attend thy side! 

by old Miletus, who so long
 have cease his love-inwoven song:
 by all you teach the Tuscan maid,
 in change italia modern shade:
 by he who knight distinguish name
 refine a nation lust of fame;
 who tale even now, with echo sweet,
 castilia moorish h ll repeat:
 or he, who seine blue nymph deplore,
 in watchet weed on gallia shore,
 who draw the sad sicilian maid,
 by virtue in her sire betray:

o nature boon, from proceed
 each forceful thought, each prompt deed;
 if but from thou i hope to feel,
 on all my heart imprint thy seal! 
let some retreat cynic find
 those oft-turned scroll i leave behind,
 the sport and i this hour agree,
 to rove thy scene-full world with thou!
