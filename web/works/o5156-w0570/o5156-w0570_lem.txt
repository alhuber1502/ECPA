ode to death.

translate from the french of the king of Prussia.

by dr. Hawksworth.

yet a few year, or day perhaps,
or moment pass with silent lapse,
and time to i shall be no more;
no more the sun these eye shall view,
earth over these limb her dust shall strew,
and life fantastic dream be over.

alas! i touch the dreadful brink,
from nature verge impel i sink,
and endless darkness wrap i round!
yes, death be ever at my hand,
fast by my bed he take his stand,
and constant at my board be find.

earth, air, and fire, and water, join
against this fleet life of i,
and where for succour can i fly?
if art with flatter wile pretend
to shield i like a guardian friend,
by art, ere nature bid, i die.

i see this tyrant of the mind,
this idol flesh to dust consign,
once call from dust by power divine;
its feature change, it be pale, it be cold —
hence dreadful spectre! to behold
thy aspect, be to make it i.

and can i then with guilty pride,
which fear nor shame can quell or hide,
this flesh still pamper and adorn!
thus view what i soon shall be,
can what i be demand the knee,
or look on aught around with scorn?

but then this spark that warm, that guide,
that live, that think, what fate betide?
can this be dust, a knead clod!
this yield to death! the soul, the mind,
that measure heaven, and mount the wind,
that know at once itself and god?

great cause of all, above, below,
who know thou must for ever know,
immortal and divine!
thy image on my soul impress,
of endless being be the test,
and bid eternity be i!

transport thought! — but be i sure
that endless life will joy secure?
joy only to the just decree!
the guilty wretch expire, go
where vengeance endless life bestow,
that endless misery may succeed.

great god, how awful be the scene!
a breath, a transient breath between;
and can i jest, and laugh, and play!
to earth, alas! too firm bind,
tree deep root in the ground,
be shiver when they be tear away.

vain joy, which envy greatness gain,
how do you bind with silken chain,
which ask herculean strength to break!
how with new terror have you arm
the power who slight glance alarm?
how many death of one you make!

yet, dumb with wonder, i behold
man thoughtless race in error bold,
forget or scorn the law of death;
with these no project coincide,
nor vow, nor toil, nor hope, they guide,
each think he draw immortal breath.

each blind to fate approach hour,
intrigue, or fight, for wealth, or power,
and slumber danger dare provoke:
and he who totter scarce sustain
a century age, plan future gain,
and feel a unexpected stroke.

go on, unbridled desperate band,
scorn rock, gulf, wind, search sea and land,
and spoil new world wherever find.
seize, haste to seize the glitter prize,
and sigh, and tear, and prayer despise,
nor spare the temple holy ground.

they go, succeed, but look again,
the desperate hand you seek in vain,
now tread in dust the peasant scorn.
but who that see their treasure swell,
that hear the insatiate vow rebel,
will ever have think they mortal bear?

see the world victor mount his car,
blood mark his progress wide and far,
sure he shall reign while age fly;
no, vanish like a morning cloud,
the hero be but just allow
to fight, to conquer, and to die.

and be it true, i ask with dread,
that nation heap on nation bleed
beneath his chariot fervid wheel,
with trophy to adorn the spot,
where his pale corpse be leave to rot,
and doom the hungry reptile meal?

yes, fortune weary with her play,
her toy, this hero, cast away,
and scarce the form of man be see:
awe chill my breast, my eye overflow,
around my brow no rose glow,
the cypress mine, funereal green!

yet in this hour of grief and fear,
when awful truth unveiled appear,
some power unknown usurp my breast;
back to the world my thought be lead,
my foot in folly labyrinth tread,
and fancy dream that life be bless.

how weak a empress be the mind,
who pleasure flowery wreath can bind,
and captive to her altar lead!
weak reason yield to frenzy rage,
and all the world be folly stage,
and all that act be fool indeed.

and yet this strange, this sudden flight,
from gloomy care to gay delight,
this fickleness, so light and vain,
in life delusive transient dream,
where man nor thing be what they seem,
be all the real good we gain.
