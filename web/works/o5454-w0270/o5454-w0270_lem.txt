song xxvii.

for the lord's-day morning.

i 

this be the day when Christ arise
 so early from the dead;
 why shall i keep my eyelid close,
 and waste my hour in bed? 

ii.

this be the day when Jesus break
 the power of death and hell;
 and shall i still wear Satan yoke,
 and love my sin so well? 

iii.

to-day with pleasure christian meet,
 to pray and hear the word:
 and i will go with cheerful foot
 to learn thy will, o lord. 

iv.

i will leave my sport to read and pray,
 and so prepare for heaven:
 o may i love this bless day
 the best of all the seven!
