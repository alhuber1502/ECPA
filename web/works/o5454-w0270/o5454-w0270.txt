SONG XXVII.

For the LORD's-DAY MORNING.

I.

THis is the Day when CHRIST arose
 So early from the Dead;
 Why should I keep my Eyelids clos'd,
 And waste my Hours in Bed? 

II.

This is the Day when JESUS broke
 The Pow'r of Death and Hell;
 And shall I still wear Satan's Yoke,
 And love my Sins so well? 

III.

To-Day with Pleasure Christians meet,
 To pray and hear the Word:
 And I would go with cheerful Feet
 To learn thy Will, O LORD. 

IV.

I'll leave my Sport to read and pray,
 And so prepare for Heav'n:
 O may I love this blessed Day
 The best of all the Sev'n!
