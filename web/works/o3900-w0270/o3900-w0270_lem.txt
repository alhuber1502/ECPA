on Clemens alexandrinus description of a perfect christian.

i 

here from afar the finish height
 of holiness be see:
 but o what heavy tract of toil,
 what desert lie between? 

ii.

man for the simple life divine
 what will it cost to break;
 ere pleasure soft and wily pride
 no more within he speak? 

iii.

what linger anguish must corrode
 the root of nature joy? 
what secret shame and dire defeat
 the pride of heart destroy? 

iv.

learn thou the whole of mortal state
 in stillness to sustain;
 nor sooth with false delight of earth
 who god have doom to pain. 

v. 

thy mind now multitude of thought,
 now stupor shall distress;
 the venom of each latent vice
 wild image impress. 

vi.

yet dark safe with god thy soul
 his arm still onward bear,
 till through each tempest on her face
 a peace beneath appear. 

vii.

it be in that peace we see and act
 by instinct from above;
 with fine taste of wisdom fraught,
 and mystic power of love. 

viii.

yet ask not in mere ease and pomp
 of ghostly gift to shine:
 till death the lowness of man,
 and decent grief be thy.
