morning.

by J. Cunningham.

in the barn the tenant cock,
 close to Partlet perch on high,
 brisk crow, (the shepherd clock)
 and proclaim the morning nigh. 

swift from the mountain brow,
 shadow, nurse by night, retire;
 and the peep sun-beam now
 paint with gold the village-spire. 

now the pine-tree wave top
 gentle greet the morning gale;
 and the new-waked kidling crop
 daisy round the dewy vale. 

philomel forsake the thorn,
 plaintive where she prate at night;
 and the lark, to greet the morn,
 soar beyond the shepherd sight. 

from the clay-built cottage-ridge,
 see the chatter swallow spring! 
dart through the one-arched bridge,
 quick she dip her dapple wing. 

lo the busy bee employ! 
restless till their task be do! 
now from sweet to sweet, uncloyed,
 sip dew before the sun. 

trickle through the creviced rock,
 see the silver stream distil! 
sweet refreshment for the flock,
 when it be sun-drove from the hill! 

ploughman, for the promise corn
 ripen over the bank of Tweed,
 anxious hear the huntsman horn,
 soften by the shepherd reed. 

sweet, oh sweet, the warble throng,
 on the white emblossom spray;
 all be music, mirth, and song,
 at the jocund dawn of day. 

noon.

by the same.

fervid now the sun-beam glow,
 drink deep the morning gem;
 not a dew-drop's leave the rose,
 to refresh her parent stem. 

by the brook the shepherd dine,
 from the fierce meridian heat
 shelter by the branch pine,
 pendent over his grassy seat. 

see, the flock forsake the glade,
 where unchecked the sunbeam fall,
 sure to find a please shade
 by the ivy abbey wall. 

echo, in her airy round
 over the river, rock, and hill,
 can catch a single sound,
 save the clack of yonder mill. 

cattle court the breeze bland,
 where the streamlet wander cool;
 or with languid silence stand
 midway in the marshy pool. 

but from mountain, dell, or stream,
 not a flutter zephyr spring;
 fearful lest the pierce beam
 scorch its soft, its silken wing. 

not a leaf have leave to stir;
 nature lull, serene and still;
 quiet even the shepherd cur,
 sleep on the heath-clad hill. 

languid be the landscape round,
 till the fresh descend shower
 kind cool the thirsty ground,
 and revive each faint flower. 

now the hill, the hedge, be green,
 now the warbler throat be in tune;
 blithsome be the vernal scene,
 brighten by the beam of noon. 

evening.

by the same.

as the plod ploughman go
 homeward, (to the hamlet bind)
 giantlike his shadow grow,
 lengthen over the level ground. 

over the mead the bullock stray
 free â€” the furrow task be do;
 and the village window blaze,
 burnish by the set sun. 

Mark he, from behind the hill,
 strike the purple-painted sky;
 can the pencil mimic skill
 copy the refulgent dye? 

where the rise forest spread
 round the time-decaying dome,
 to their high-built airy bed
 see the rook return home! 

as the lark, with vary tune,
 carol to the evening, loud,
 mark the mild resplendent moon
 break through a part cloud! 

now the hermit howlet peep
 from the barn, or twist brake,
 and the curl vapour creep
 over the lily-bordered lake:

as the trout, in speckle pride,
 playful, from its bosom spring,
 to the bank a ruffle tide
 verges in successive ring. 

trip through the silken grass,
 over the path-divided dale,
 see, the rose-complexioned lass
 with the well-poised milking-pail! 

linnet with unnumbered note,
 and the cuckoo bird with two,
 tune sweet their mellow throat,
 bid the set sun adieu.
