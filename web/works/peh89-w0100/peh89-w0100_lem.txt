observation. 

let the vain avaricious with oath safe bind,
 lest either forgetful rove;
 the band of affection secure the mind,
 when the wish be center in love. 
if virtue alone be the guide of the will,
 distrust have no right to be there;
 the swain have no reason to doubt of his skill,
 and the fair one has'nothing to fear.
