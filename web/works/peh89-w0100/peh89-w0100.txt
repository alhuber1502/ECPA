OBSERVATION. 

LET the vain avaricious with oaths safely bind,
 Lest either forgetfully rove;
 The band of affection secureth the mind,
 When the wishes are centered in love. 
If virtue alone is the guide of the will,
 Distrust has no right to be there;
 The swain has no reason to doubt of his skill,
 And the fair one has'nothing to fear.
