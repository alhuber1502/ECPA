fragment at tunbridge-well. 

for he, that make, must new create we,
 ere Seneca, or Epictetus,
 with all their serious admonition,
 can, for the spleen, prove good physician. 
the heart be unruly palpitation
 will not be lay by a quotation;
 nor will the spirit move the light
 for the most celebrate writer. 
sweat, swoon, and convulsive motion
 will not be cure by word, and notion. 
then live, old brown! with thy chalybeat,
 which keep we from become idiot. 
at Tunbridge let we still be drink,
 though it be the antipode to think:
 such hurry, while the spirit fly,
 such stupefaction, when it be die:
 yet these, and not sententious paper,
 must brighten life, and cure the vapour, etc..
