to miss bâ€”sh, of Bristol.

before i seek the dreary shore,
 where gambia rapid billow roar,
 and foam pour along;
 to you i urge the plaintive strain,
 and though a lover sing in vain,
 yet you shall hear the song

ungrateful, cruel, lovely maid,
 since all my torment be repay
 with frown or languid sneer;
 with assiduity no more
 your captive will your health implore,
 or tease you with his tear. 

now to the region where the sun
 do his hot course of glory run,
 and parch up the ground:
 where over the burn cleave plain,
 a long external dogstar reign,
 and splendour flame around:

there will i go, yet not to find
 a fire intenser than my mind,
 which burn a constant flame:
 there will i lose thy heavenly form,
 nor shall remembrance, rapture, warm,
 draw shadow of thy frame. 

in the rough element the sea,
 i will drown the soft subject, thou,
 and sink each lovely charm:
 no more my bosom shall be tear;
 no more by wild idea bear,
 i will cherish the alarm. 

yet, Polly, can thy heart be kind,
 soon will my feeble purpose find
 thy sway within my breast:
 but hence, soft scene of paint woe,
 spite of the dear delight i will go,
 forget she, and be bless.
