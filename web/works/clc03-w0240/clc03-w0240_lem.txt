solitude. 

1. 

happy be they who when alone
can with themselves converse;
who to their thought be so familiar grow,
that with delight in some obscure recess,
they can with silent joy think all their hour away,
and still think on, till the confine clay
fall off, and nothing be leave behind
of drossy earth, nothing to clog the mind,
or hinder its ascent to those bright form above,
those glorious being who exalt sense
transcend the high flight of human wit;
who with seraphic ardor fire,
and with a passion more intense
than mortal beauty ever inspire;
with all the endear ecstasy of love,
will to their bless society again
the long lose wanderer admit,
where free from all their former pain,
and cleanse from every stain,
they bask with pleasure in eternal day,
and grow as pure, and as refine as they.

2. 

but few, ah! few be for retirement fit;
but few the joy of solitude can taste;
the most with horror fly from it,
and rather choose in croud their time to waste;
in busy croud, which a resemblance bear
to the unshaped embryo of the world,
that formless mass where all thing be
without distinction rude hurl:
tumult and noise the empire there have gain,
unrivalled there disorder reign:
the thoughtless atom meet by chance,
without design they move, confusion lead the dance:
sometime the earthly particle aspire,
and upward force their way,
while the spirituous part retire,
and near the centre lie
depress and sink, till by the next remove
they disengage, and get above,
but can not long the impel shock sustain,
by turn they rise, by turn they fall again.

3. 

we in our self a second chaos find;
there be a transcript of it in the human mind:
our restless passion endless war maintain,
and with loud clamour fill the breast:
love often there the sovereignty do gain,
as often be by hatred dispossess:
desire the soul with anxious thought do fill,
insatiate boundless thought instill:
some distant good we view,
which we, by hope push on, pursue,
breathless, and faint, the toilsome chase renew:
and when it be we, tumultuous joy do rise,
ungoverned transport sparkle in our eye;
and we all ecstasy, all fire,
the darling prize admire,
and hug the bless till it do expire:
then to despair our self resign,
and sigh, and grieve, and still repine,
curse heaven, our self, our friend, our fate,
and new, more pungent, woe create:
but if the sportive goddess lie
a bright temptation in our way,
all be forget, and full of heat,
our former toil we soon repeat;
again pursue the airy game;
and fond of grandeur, fond of fame,
of glory, power, and glitter clay,
we in laborious nothing waste our short remains of day.

4. 

when distant ill we see,
the dismal prospect we affright,
the sad futurity
fear in our mind excite:
and by a mean dishonourable dread
of evil which may never be,
our self we fright, our spirit waste,
and often our misfortune haste:
when they be present, then we rage,
impatient, hot, and furious grow,
nothing our fury can assuage;
no limit, no restraint we know:
but by the headlong passion lead,
without the least demur obey;
and like some mighty torrent force our way:
some mighty torrent which no limit know,
but with a rapid course still onward go,
destroy the snowy flock, and lay majestic structure low:
but if a glimmer hope arise,
if but a gleam of bliss appear,
again we be easy, please, and gay:
forgetful of what past before,
above the cloud we vain soar:
impend danger we despise,
and present evil dread no more:
and while we proud hover there,
look down with scorn upon the phantom fear.

5. 

thus they alternate do lose and win,
and all be anarchy within:
reason her native right may claim,
and strive to reascend the throne,
but few, alas! her power will own:
the most to folly their allegiance pay,
please with her easy, and her childish sway:
their passion rule, and they content obey:
slave to themselves they without murmur prove,
and with the mean, worst of servitude in love,
by the strong impulse of their vice move:
their chain they hug, and wisdom aid refuse,
and will not she for their director choose:
her path they shun, her yoke they will not bear,
and think her precept too severe:
deaf to the call of virtue and of fame,
they mad wander through the maze of life,
employ in trifle, or engage in strife:
enslave by interest, fond of glitter toy,
and much more please with bubble, than with solid joy.
