sister belove! friend of my inmost heart! 
accept this effort of the painter art.
 such be thy hannah form, but who shall find
 the skill to paint her heart, where thou be shrine? 
to show thou all her love, her anxious care,
 her fond solicitude for thou declare? 
those tie, which be ordain by nature law,
 the will hand of friendship close draw;
 for have thou not, by nature sacred voice,
 my sister be, thou still have be my choice;
 my friend select, partner of my breast,
 thy worth esteem, thy merit all confess:
 thy heart in which the virtue all be join,
 thy polish manner, and thy candid mind,
 have win my soul to court the worth it love,
 to seek the modest merit it approve. 
bless may thou be through a long, blameless life,
 nor sting by envy, nor annoy by strife;
 may health still bloom on thy brow be see,
 nor care, nor sorrow make it less serene. 
thou, fortune! who so oft have be the slave,
 of many a miser, dastard, fool, and knave,
 for once be just, â€” endow one generous mind,
 who will use thy gift to bless, as heaven design;
 from thy huge wreathe one little chaplet twine,
 to grace my sister, friend, and valentine!
