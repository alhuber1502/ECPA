ode on the death of MATZEL, a favourite bullfinch,

address to mr. ST—PE, to who the author have give the reversion of it when he leave Dresden.

by the same.

i 

try not my st—pe, it be in vain
to stop your tear, to hide your pain,
or check your honest rage;
give sorrow and revenge their scope,
my present joy, your future hope,
lie murder in his cage.

ii.

matzel no more, you grace, love,
you linnet, nightingale and dove,
attend the untimely bier;
let every sorrow be express,
beat with your wing each mournful breast,
and drop the natural tear.

iii.

in height of song, in beauty pride,
by fell grimalkin claw he die —
but vengeance shall have way;
on pain and torture i will refine;
yet, Matzel, that one death of thy,
he nine will ill repay.

iv.

for thou, my bird, the sacred nine,
who love thy tuneful note, shall join
in thy funereal verse:
my painful task shall be to write
the eternal dirge which they indite,
and hang it on thy hearse.

v. 

in vain i love, in vain i mourn
my bird, who never to return
be flee to happy shade,
where lesbia shall for he prepare
the place most charm, and most fair
of all the elysian glade.

vi.

there shall thy note in cypress grove
sooth wretched ghost that die for love;
there shall thy plaintive strain
lull impious phaedra endless grief,
to Procris yield some short relief,
and soften dido pain.

vii.

till Proserpine by chance shall hear
thy note, and make thou all her care,
and love thou with my love;
while each attendant soul shall praise
the matchless matzel tuneful lay,
and all his song approve.
