to mr. Henry Bendish. 

the indian philosopher, or match make above, but break in come down.

i 

why shall our joy transform to pain? 
why gentle Hymen silken chain
 a plague of iron prove? 
Bendish, it be strange the charm that bind
 million of hand shall leave their mind
 at such a loose from love. 

ii.

in vain i seek the wondrous cause,
 range the wide field of nature law,
 and urge the school in vain;
 then deep in thought, within my breast
 my soul retire, and slumber dress
 a bright instructive scene. 

iii.

over the broad land and across the tide
 on fancy airy horse i ride,
 (sweet rapture of the mind)
 till on the bank of Ganges flood
 in a tall ancient grove i stand
 for sacred use design. 

iv.

hard by a venerable priest
 rise with his god the sun from rest
 awake his morning-song;
 thrice he conjure the murmur stream;
 the birth of soul be all his theme,
 and half divine his tongue. 

v. 

 "he sing the eternal roll flame,
" that vital mass, that still the same
 "do all our mind compose;
" but shape in twice ten thousand frame,
 "thence differ soul of differ name,
" and jar temper rise. 

vi.

 "the mighty power that form the mind
" one mould for every two design,
 "and bless the new-born pair:
" this be a match for this, he say,
 "then down he send the soul he make
" to seek they body here:

vii.

 "but part from their warm abode
" they lose their fellow on the road,
 "and never join their hand:
" ah cruel chance, and cross fate! 
 "our eastern soul have drop their mate
" on europe barbarous land. 

viii.

 "happy the youth that find the bride
" who birth be to his own ally,
 "the sweet joy of life:
" but oh the crowd of wretched soul
 "fetter to mind of different mould,
" and chain the eternal strife! 

ix.

thus sing the wondrous indian bard,
 my soul with vast attention hear,
 while Ganges cease to flow:
 "sure then, i cry, may i but see
" that gentle nymph that twin with i,
 "i may be happy too. 

x. 

 "some courteous angel tell i where,
" what distant land this unknown fair
 "or distant sea detain? 
" swift as the wheel of nature roll
 "i'de fly to meet and mingle soul,
" and wear the joyful chain.
