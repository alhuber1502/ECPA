To the Earl of CHESTERFIELD.

CAN ease be consistent with state?
Can freedom and pomp thus agree?
O STANHOPE, who wou'd not be great,
If easy in greatness like thee?
Let statesmen pretend to despise
Those talents that furnish delight,
'Tis STANHOPE'S alone to be wise,
Yet pleasure with wisdom unite.

State burthens with form the gay soul,
Unbended alone we taste joy.
Too soon our grey hairs must controul
That bliss which our prime should employ.
Then, STANHOPE, be blest in your choice,
Be happy your life in each stage;
While spirits attend you rejoice,
You've wisdom enough for old age.
