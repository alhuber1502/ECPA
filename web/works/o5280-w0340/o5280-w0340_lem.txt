stanza on paint.

to the reverend WILLIAM Peters, LL.B.  

when first in Greece the art be young,
 and muse wild rude number sing,
 that power of genius dawn on earth,
 which over the tablet polish face
 the line of art begin to trace,
 it be beauty give it birth. 

when persian charm Apelles draw,
 the force of beauty then he know. 
now see the youth unconscious gaze;
 now see the lifeless tablet bear
 the grace of the live fair,
 and love bright passion blaze. 

obedient now to painting call,
 the passion come attendant all:
 now joy supreme, now deep despair,
 alternate fill the glow scene;
 now madness wild, now grief serene,
 now vengeance rage there. 

how drear the scene that Rosa choose! 
his picture field no bloom disclose;
 nought but the dark and dreary pine,
 or rock immense of height sublime,
 coaeval they with hoary time,
 the mark of power divine. 

but who thy glow scene can view,
 and crown thou, Claude, with honour due? 
or who the sacred source can trace,
 whence Raphael steal the spark divine
 that through his form be see to shine? 
or Rubens catch his grace? 

when Peters bid the canvas glow
 with shape but little know below,
 O! say, when cherube form divine
 in all their native glory shine;
 say, where the bound of magic art? 
genius, though station here below,
 no sublunary bound will know,
 like Peters still it will seek its theme,
 beyond pale cynthia quiver beam,
 and charm the feeling heart.
