a song.

by T. p***cy.

o Nancy, will thou go with i,
nor sigh to leave the flaunt town:
can silent glen have charm for thou,
the lowly cot and russet gown?
no long dress in silken sheen,
no long deck with jewel rare,
say can thou quit each courtly scene,
where thou be fair of the fair?

o Nancy! when thou be far away,
will thou not cast a wish behind?
say can thou face the parch ray,
nor shrink before the wintery wind?
o can that soft and gentle mien
extreme of hardship learn to bear,
nor sad regret each courtly scene,
where thou be fair of the fair?

o Nancy! can thou love so true,
through peril keen with i to go,
or when thy swain mishap shall rue,
to share with he the pang of woe?
say shall disease or pain befall,
will thou assume the nurse care,
nor wistful those gay scene recall
where thou be fair of the fair?

and when at last thy love shall die,
will thou receive his part breath?
will thou repress each struggle sigh,
and clear with smile the bed of death?
and will thou over his breathless clay
strew flower, and drop the tender tear,
nor then regret those scene so gay,
where thou be fair of the fair?
