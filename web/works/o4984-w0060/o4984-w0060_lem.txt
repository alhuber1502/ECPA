some thought on building and plant,

to sir JAMES Lowther, Bart. of lowther-hall.

by the same.

when stately structure Lowther grace,
 worthy the owner and the place,
 fashion will not the work direct,
 but reason be the architect. 

ready each beauteous order stand
 to execute what she command. 
the doric grave, where weight require;
 to give his manly strength aspire;
 the light corinthian, rich gay,
 do all embellishment display;
 between they see, with matron air,
 the ionic, delicate fair! 

these their abundant aid will lend
 to answer every structure end. 
to building can a mode belong
 but gay, or delicate, or strong? 
why search we then for order new,
 rich in these all-comprising few,
 but that the standard rule of Greece
 disdain to humour wild caprice? 
they fancy wanton freak control,
 in every part consult the whole,
 teach art to dress, and not disguise,
 seek last fame, not short surprise,
 and all adorn to produce
 from real or from seem use,
 the place genius to revere,
 and, as he bid, the structure rear. 

smile he over fragrant Flora bloom? 
never shock he with a grotto gloom. 
nor with smooth slender column mock
 his roughness in the rugged rock. 
nor by trim step hand gentle down,
 (like dainty dame in formal town)
 the nimble Naiades, who bind
 over native rock with sprightly sound. 
nor rove dryad confine
 precise to a single line,
 strait, circular, or serpentine. 

all form arise at nature call,
 and use can beauty give to all. 
none ever disgust the judge mind,
 when vary well, or well combine. 

this lowther noble planter know,
 and keep it in his constant view. 
so sweet wild his wood be strew,
 nature mistake they for her own,
 yet all to proper soil and site
 so suit, double they delight. 
while tender plant in vale repose,
 where the mild zephyr only blow,
 embattle fir bleak hill adorn,
 under who safeguard smile the corn. 
who build or plant, this rule shall know,
 from truth and use all beauty flow.
