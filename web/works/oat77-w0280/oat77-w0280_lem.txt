the match.

by what wild frenzy be i lead,
that with a muse i needs must wed?
who dower consist of popular fame,
the short possession of a name!
yet with what trouble and debate
the owner hold this poor estate?
where after long expense and toil
he starve on the ungrateful soil.
the field and groves which poet feign
the curious fancy entertain,
but yeild no nourish grain or fruit,
the crave stomach to recruit.
with thirsty tongue the Rhymer sing
of nectar and olympian spring.
and such i fear the fairy ground
of their Elysium will be find.
a mere fool paradise, and fit
for such as will be man of wit. 
yet fain will i that Rhymer know,
that rave not of the shade below,
who verse describe not there each hill,
each flowery vale and wander rill,
with such precise particular care,
as he have be a native there;
when (maugre all his art and pain)
what be his gay elysian plain
but a imaginary cheat,
utopia's form in the wild conceit,
when with poetic calenture
it be seize, and death alone can cure.
