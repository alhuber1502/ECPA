epigram xiii.

lovely shine thy wed fair,
gentle as the yield air;
cheer as the solar beam,
soothe as the fountain-stream.

why then, jealous husband, rail?
all may breathe the ambient gale,
bask in heaven diffusive ray,
drink the stream that pass away.
all may share unlessening joy,
why then jealous, peevish boy?
water, air, and light confine,
ere thou think she only thy.
