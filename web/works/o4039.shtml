The following collection of pieces are liable to none of the objections which are made to the other. They are the genuine and acknowledged<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e1724">[Page x]</span> productions of Thomas Chatterton; a person whose genius and abilities, exercised at a very early period of life, will no less command the respect of posterity, than they have excited the attention, and divided the sentiments of the ablest judge of the present age.</p><p>With respect to Rowley's poems, the prevailing opinion seems to be, th<span class="gap" title="illegible">•…</span>they were actually written by Chatterton: for though the antique manner in which they were cloathed, had served greatly to disguise them, yet it could not but be observed that that the smoothness of the versification, and the frequent<span id="o4039-n00030_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="The argument arising from the coincidences which might be pointed out between the supposed ancient poems and later writers, hath not been attended to …" href="#o4039-n00030" aria-controls="o4039-n00030" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o4039-n00030"><sup>*</sup> The argument arising from the coincidences which might be pointed out between the supposed ancient poems and later writers, hath not been attended to in the manner it deserves. It would be more decisive than any other yet made use of. Let any person compare the parallel passages lately pointed out by a writer in the St. James's Chronicle, No. 2671, May 21, 1778, and at the same time advert to the rules laid down by bishop Hurd, for the discovery of imitations, and he will not hesitate to acknowledge, that the writer of Rowley's poems certainly lived in the present century. As this letter will be considered as a curiosity by all who interest themselves concerning the authenticity of those poems, and as it is not readily to be referred to, being printed only in a news-paper, we have subjoined it to the present publication. <span id="o4039-n00035_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="See page xxiv." href="#o4039-n00035" aria-controls="o4039-n00035" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>†</sup></a></span><span style="display:block" class="collapse note  div" id="o4039-n00035"><sup>†</sup> See page xxiv.</span></span> traces of imitation of later<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e2588">[Page xi]</span> writers<span class="gap" title="illegible">〈…〉</span>utterly inconsistent with the<span class="gap" title="illegible">〈…〉</span>their being the productions of the fifteenth century.

But before this is granted, it should be recollected that he was, as Mr. Warton<span id="o4039-n00040_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Additions to History of Poetry, vol.

It should be recollected, before we pronouce decisively upon this subject, that there have been instances almost as extraordinary as that we have now under consideration. Dr. Wotton, at the age of six years, acquired a considerable knowledge in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues; and Dr. Johnson<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e3799">[Page xiv]</span> has given the life of one<span id="o4039-n00045_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="John Phillip Barretier." href="#o4039-n00045" aria-controls="o4039-n00045" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o4039-n00045"><sup>*</sup> John Phillip Barretier.</span> who mastered five languages at the age of nine years. These acquisitions are certainly as wonderful as Chatterton's knowledge of the obsolete language of the 15th and 16th centuries, which he was known to be fond of, and to which he had particularly applied his attention. Nor should the contrivance of such a fraud be deemed beyond the reach of one who possessed such abilities. It is known that a person who was distinguished by the name of Psalmanazar, in the beginning of the present century, fabricated a new language, and actually succeeded in imposing upon some of the most intelligent and inquisitive persons of the times, who were equally as desirous, as able to detect the imposture, had it not been managed with a degree of art which eluded all their vigilance.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e4285">[Page xv]</span><p>It will hardly be denied, that acquisitions like those we have before mentioned are equally surprising with any which Chatterton is supposed to have reached; unless the invention of new characters for a language, or the difficulties of obtaining an accurate knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, are more easy to overcome than to imitate the manner of writing in the time of Edward the fourth. But instances may be produced of persons whose extent of intelligence hath been as great in subjects more abstruse, and not less out of the common walk, than those to which Chatterton devoted his attention. It will be sufficient to name the celebrated Crichton, and M. Servin, mentioned by Sully, between both whom and our author a resemblance might be discovered, as well in their astonishing abilities, as in those defects which marked the private<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e4783">[Page xvi]</span> characters of each of these young adventurers.</p><p>As the present publication consists of pieces of which not the smallest doubt was ever entertained of their being genuine, it is totally unnecessary here to enter into any argument either to support or invalidate those proofs which have been adduced of the authenticity of the supposed ancient poems; and it is the less incumbent on the present editor, as the public hath lately received entire satisfaction on that head from the same gentleman to whom we are indebted for the first collection of this writer's works. It may not however be unnecessary to add a few words, in order to compleat the short account given by that gentleman of so extraordinary a personage, who may be considered as the literary phenomenon of the times, and whose genius, if it had been properly fostered and encouraged, might have carried English literature<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e5291">[Page xvii]</span> to as high a pitch as any author in the present century. One can scarce avoid drawing a parallel upon the present occasion, from the similarity of circumstances between our author and the great father of the English stage; the one obliged to cramp and abase his genius to the ideas and taste of a barbarous audience; the other, from necessity, compelled to obey the mandates of the directers of our monthly publications, equally dogmatical, ignorant and insipid.</p><p>The former editor hath already set forth the few circumstances, relative to his author, which he possessed in common, with other men. The time of his birth, and death; the names of his parents, his profession, and the confined mode of his education, are all accurately stated. It is to be regretted, that he permitted, the <span class="hi">sangfroid</span> of the antiquary, to repress, that<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e5803">[Page xviii]</span> warmth, which the excellence of his author might have been expected to excite; surely, that excellence demanded some few words of commendation: it is also to be lamented that he did not enter more minutely into the disposition and circumstances of one whom he could not but respect as an author, however he might dislike his chararacter, as a man: and here it must be confessed, Chatterton appears to us in the most unfavourab<span class="gap" title="illegible">•</span>e point of view. He possessed all the vices and irregularities of youth, and his profligacy was, at least, as conspicuous as his abilities. Although he was of a profession which might be said to accelerate his pursuits in antiquities, yet so averse was he to that profession, that he could never overcome it. One of his first efforts, to emerge from a situation so irksome to him, was an application to a gentleman well known in the republic of letters;<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e6344">[Page xix]</span> which unfortunately for the public, and himself, met with a very cold reception; and which the disappointed author always spoke of with a high degree of acrimony, whenever it was mentioned to him.</p><p>After his quitting Bristol, he was engaged to assist Mr. Northhook, in a history of London, then publishing in numbers, and, at the same time, was daily writing some piece for the magazines. Every effort appears to have been insufficient to ward off the approach of poverty; and very soon after he settled in London, his distress became so great, that he meditated a design of going to Senegal. <span id="o4039-n00050_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="See Poem to Miss Bush page 85." href="#o4039-n00050" aria-controls="o4039-n00050" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o4039-n00050"><sup>*</sup> See Poem to Miss Bush page 85.</span>This intention was never executed. He continued drudging for the booksellers a few months, when at last, oppressed with poverty and disease, in<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e6816">[Page xx]</span> a fit of despair, he put an end to his existence in the month of August 1770, with a dose of poison.</p><p>Such was the wretched life, and such the fatal end, of one who, had he not prematurely finished his days, had bidden fair to do the highest honours to English literature. The reader will anticipate every reflection of regret which can be made upon this occasion; and while he sympathizes with the unfortunate, he will lament that one who is allowed to have been, as Mr. Warton expresses it,<span class="q"> "a prodigy of genius,"</span>should, by the mere dint of distress, be tempted to rid himself of an insupportable existence. He will feel himself hurt at the idea that no notice should be taken of one who the last mentioned writer pronounces would have proved the first of English poets, had he reached a maturer age; and perhaps<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e7343">[Page xxi]</span> he may feel some indignation against the person to whom his first application was made, and by whom he was treated with neglect and contempt. It were to be wished that the public was fully informed of all the circumstances attending that unhappy application; the event of which deprived the world of works which might have contributed to the honour of the nation, as well as the comfort and happiness of their unfortunate author.</p><p>It is observed, by the elegant writer before quoted, that some of the verses contained in the following miscellany, which are those written by their author <span class="hi">without any design to deceive, have been judged to be most astonishing productions by the first critic of the present age. </span>After such a judgment it cannot be mentioned without exciting wonder, that writings which<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e7804">[Page]</span> deserve such a character, should continue undistinguished amidst the trash of monthly compilations. A striking similarity may be observed between them and their author, both having met with a fate very unworthy their merit, equally contemned and despised; he, living and dying in obscurity; they, remaining neglected and almost unknown.</p><p>That they may hereafter stand a monument of the application and abilities of an unfortunate man, untimely lost to himself and to the public, one who had a slight knowledge of him in his life time, but not enough to be acquainted with his merits, until too late, who considers the neglect which hath been shewn to these his acknowledged works, as an imputation on the taste and curiosity of the age, hath employed a few leisure hours in collecting the following<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e8269">[Page xxiii]</span> miscellany, which he trusts, after such respectable opinions as are before quoted, will not require either excuse or apology, but on the contrary, will entitle him to the acknowledgments of those readers whose candour will induce them to applaud the marks of genius which may be found herein, and at the same time make every due allowance for those imperfections which haste, or the unhappy circumstances in which many of them were written, would have given the author, had he been living, a title to expect and demand.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">J.

It was given to me some time since by Mr. George Catcott, whose name has been so often mentioned on the present occasion, and to whose inquisitive disposition, and very commendable zeal, the public is principally indebted for the preservation and appearance of these valuable productions of antiquity. It may be necessary to inform you, that, when Chatterton gave this fragment to his friend, he was utterly (and ever after continued) unacquainted with any language but his mother-tongue; and that<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e75530">[Page 113]</span> the citations of these languages, from two antient authors, have been fully authenticated. The poetical talents of our bard are established by the publication of his poems; but the following fragment of a sermon on the divinity of the Holy Spirit, displays him in the more illustrious character of an orthodox divine. Every circumstance which tends to throw light on the history of Rowlie should be given to the public, and his sentiments on so essential a point of the Christian religion by no means suppressed, notwithstanding they may not have the sanction of an age unhappily overgrown with Arianism and infidelity. Chatterton himself, although he totally disbelieved the subject of the fragment, had, however the ingenuity to produce it; and I am sorry that the ingenuous editors had not thought it (and some others of Rowlie's prose productions in their possession) worthy of being published together with his poetical compositions.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Yours, &amp;c.

Canynge was also a man of an extensive genius, and a liberal turn of mind, the distinguished patron of literature, and a lover of the fine arts. Rowley, it appears by his writings, lived in the greatest intimacy with him, and received very extraordinary marks of his favour and generosity. On all occasions he shews his gratitude to his illustrious friend, takes perpetual delight in dwelling on his many amiable virtues, and constanly manifests an earnest desire of transmitting his fame to posterity.

Though not wholly neglected now, it cannot boast of the honours it once had; the veneration for religious seasons fled with popery, and old English hospitality is long since deceased. Our modern playthings of fortune, who make the whole year a revolution of dissipation and joyless festivity, cannot distinguish this season; unless by resting from their laborious pleasures, and (if they can think) find a happy serenity in solitude and reflection, unknown in the tumult of hurricanes. — The ancient Christmas gambols were, in my opinion, superior to our modern spectacles and amusements; wrestling, hurling the ball, and dancing in the woodlands, were pleasures for men; it is true, the conversation of the hearth-fide was the tales of superstition:<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e86577">[Page 130]</span> the fairies, Robin Goodfellow, and hobgoblins, never failed to make the trembling audience mutter an Ave Maria, and cross their chins; but the laughable exercises of blindman's buff, riddling, and question and command, sufficiently compensated for the sew sudden starts of terror. Add to these amusements, the wretched voices of the chanters and sub chanters; howling carols in Latin; the chiming of consecrated bells; the burning consecrated wax candles; curiously representing the Virgin Mary; praying the saint whose monastery stood nearest; the munching consecrated cross-loaves, sold by the monks; all which effectually eradicated the spectres of their terrific stories. Nor were these the only charms against the foul fiends, and night-mare; sleeping cross-legged, like the effigies of Knights Templars, and warriors, and the holy bush and church-yard yew, were certain antidotes against those invisible beings. After this representation, I may be thought partial to my own hobby-horse, as an antiquary, in giving the preference to the amusements of the days of old; but let the sentimental reader consider that the tales of superstition, when believed, affect the soul with a sensation pleasurably<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e87234">[Page 131]</span> horrid; we may paint in more lively colours to the eye, they spoke to the heart.</p><p>The great barons and knights usually kept open house during this season, when their villains, or vassals, were entertained with bread, beef, and beer, and a pudding, wastol cake, or Christmas kitchel, and a groat in silver at parting; being obliged, in return, to wave the full flaggon round their heads, in honour of the master of the house. Sometimes the festival continued, till Twelfthday, when the baron, or his steward, took the deis, or upper seat of the table, and after dinner gave every man a new gown of his livery, and two Christmas kitchels. — This kind of liberality, endeared the barons to the common people, and made them ever ready to take up arms under their banners.</p><p>A register of the nunnery of Keynsham relates, that William, earl of Glocester, entertained two hundred knights with tilts and fortunys, at his great manor of Keynsham, provided thirty pies of the eels of Avon, as a curious dainty; and on the Twelfth-day began the plays for the knights<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e87899">[Page 132]</span> by the monks; with miracles and maumeries for the henchmen and servants, by minstrels.</p><p>Here is plainly a distinction made between maumeries and miracles, and the more noble representations comprehended under the name plays. The first were the holiday entertainments of the vulgar; the other of the barons and nobility. The private exhibitions at the manors of the barons, were usually family histories, the monk, who represented the master of the family, being arrayed in a tabard (or herald's coat without sleeves) painted with all the hatchments of the names. In these domestic performances absurdities were unavoidable; and in a play wrote by Sir Tibbet Gonges, Constance, countess of Bretagne and Richmond, marries and buries her three husbands in the compass of an hour. Sometimes these pieces were merely relations, and had only two characters of this kind, as that in Weever's Funeral monuments. None but the patrons of monasteries had the service of the monks in performing plays on holidays; provided the same contained nothing against God or the church. The public exhibitions were superior to the private; the plot, generally, the life of some pope, or the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e88572">[Page 133]</span> founder of the abbey the monks belonged to. I have seen several of these pieces, mostly Latin, and cannot think our ancestors so ignorant of dramatic excellence as the generality of modern writers would represent: they had a good moral in view, and some of the maumeries abound with wit, which though low now was not so then. Minstrels, jesters, and mummers, was the next class of performers; every knight had two or thee minstrels and jesters, who were maintained in his house, to entertain his family in their hours of dissipation; these Chancer mentions in the following passages:</p><div class="q"><div id="o4039-l06010" class="l">Doe comme, he saied, myn mynstrales,</div><div id="o4039-l06015" class="l"> And jestours for to tellen us tales,</div><div id="o4039-l06020" class="l"> Anon in mye armyage. </div><div id="o4039-l06025" class="l">Of Romaunces yatto been royals,</div><div id="o4039-l06030" class="l"> Of popes and of cardinals,</div><div id="o4039-l06035" class="l"> And eke of love longynge. </div><div class="biblfree">Rime of Sir Thopas.</div></div><div class="q"><div id="o4039-l06040" class="l">Of all manere of mynstrales,</div><div id="o4039-l06045" class="l"> And jestours thatte tellen tales,</div><div id="o4039-l06050" class="l"> Both of weepynge and of yame,</div><div id="o4039-l06055" class="l"> And of all thatte longeth unto fame. </div><div class="biblfree">Third Book of Fame.</div></div><div class="closer"><div class="signed">D.

The arts of imitation in general, as painting, architecture, sculpture, &amp;c. where the first invented. Sculptors began to work upon clay and wax, which are more flexible, and more pliable than wood and stone. They soon made statues of trees which were neither subject to corruption nor worms, as the lemon-tree, the cypress, the palm, the olive, the ebony, and the vine: at last they made use of metals, ivory, and the hardest stones; marble especially became the most precious matter, and the most esteemed for works of sculpture.</p><p>The nations amongst which this fine art was in the greatest honour were the Aegyptians; those people, so celebrated by the monuments of their gratitude towards the memory of the kings their benefactors. It was to perpetuate their names, that they erected, in the earliest ages, the two Colossean statues of Mocrus, and the queen his spouse.</p><p>The Aegyptian sculptors excelled all others in exactness of proportion; the different parts of a statue were often formed by divers artists; and these parts united made the whole perfect.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e93437">[Page 144]</span><p>The Greek historians boast of the invention of that art in their country, which they attribute to love: however, it is certain that the first essays of sculpture in Greece were very unpolished; but Dedalus, having travelled into Aegypt, improved himself in this art, and formed afterwards pupils who became the admiration of a people whose taste was not yet refined by the elegant statues of Phydias, Myron, Lysippus, &amp;c.</p><p>The Greeks, subdued by the Romans, degenerated insensibly; and the arts vanished with their freedom.</p><p>Sculpture was an exotic which never could thrive in victorious Rome; its transient glory was eclipsed by the other arts in the reign of Augustus; it declined under Tiberius, Caius, and Claudius; and re-appeared with an enormous magnitude under Nero.</p><p>The Gothic sculpture sprung afterwards from a wild imagination, unassisted by nature.</p><p>The epocha of sculpture is the same in France and Italy. The celebrated Michael Angelo worked<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e93979">[Page 145]</span> in Rome under the pontificate of Leo X. whilst John Goujon was admitted at Paris, under the patronage of Francis I.</p><p>The English advanced by slow degrees to the perfection of that art, in which they now rival their ancient masters.</p><p>The sculptors gave the name of statue to a figure in embossed work, that stands by itself in wood, stone, marble, or metal, of persons conspicuous by their birth, their rank, or their merit.</p><p>The ancients often represented figures of men, kings, and even gods, under a species of statues smaller than the natural size.</p><p>Those of persons who had distinguished themselves by their superior knowledge, their virtues, or some important services to the commonwealth, were erected at the public expence in statues of human size.</p><p>The third species of statues was designed for kings and emperors: they were taller than men<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e94481">[Page 146]</span> commonly are; and those which personated heroes were larger in proportion.</p><p>As for the Colossean statues, they represented gods; and often kings and emperors, desirous to magnify themselves by these stupendous works, reared at their own expence monuments of their vanity and folly.</p><p>An equestrian statue exhibits a man on horseback; as the statue of Charles I. at Charing-cross; the statue of Henry IV. at Paris; and that of Cosmo de Medicis, at Leghorn.</p><p>A Greek statue is naked and antique; thus called, because the Greeks displayed in that manner the gods, the heroes, and the athlets of the Olympic games.</p><p>The Roman statues are all represented with a drapery.</p><p>A mausoleum is a pompous funeral monument, decorated with sculpture and architecture, with an epitaph sacred to the memory of some considerable personage. It derives its etymology from the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e94977">[Page 147]</span> magnificent tomb, which Queen Artemisa caused to be erected for Mausolus, king of Caria, her husband.</p><p>Heroes, patriots, and statesmen, are not only entitled to the love and veneration of their cotemporaries during their lives, but their virtues and services ought to be transmitted to the latest posterity. This vanity of surviving our dust by lasting monuments of national gratitude, has prompted men to the most noble actions, and inspired them with the emulation of being enrolled in the records of time, with those great heroes whose statues and inscriptions they contemplate with a sort of extacy. The tombs of Westminster-abbey fill the mind with that awful reverence, which a magnificent and grateful nation testifies for its benefactors. The portraits of the illustrious warriors who have subdued our inveterate enemies in both hemisphered, exposed to public view in Vauxhall-gardens, create even in a dissipated multitude a kind of admiration greatly superior to that inspired by the enchantment of the place.

My possessor was a substantial man, and of some account among the monied men at Jonathan's. He was accounted a wit at his club at the Robinhood, which was not then altogether as patriotic as it is now; no Cato being permitted to mount the table, and harangue himself into an asthma. Here I lived in a state of inactivity for above a month, and heard nothing but the usual discourse of trade; when one day a couple of pretty ladies hurried into the shop, from a coach dignified with a coronet. <span class="q"> "Well, Mr. Spangle, we want to take a view of the newest patterns you have. Lord, my dear, and is the wretch really jealous?"</span><span class="q"> "Quite mad, 'pon honour. Don't you think this pattern very pretty?

The next discourse of any consequence happened between Mr. Spangle and his son. Jack Spangle was as complete a city buck as any who srequent the Park when the sun shines. He spoke an anglicised French very sluently; and murdered an overture upon the violin to admiration. <span class="q"> "Jack (said the old gentleman to him one day, when the ungracious spendthrift had made application for t'other bank bill) these wild courses will never do.

I make allowances; you are flesh and blood as well as myself; would you had as much prudence as many years have taught me. I protest, when I was a young fellow, I cut as pretty a figure as you with half the expence. I used to take a trip into the country, hire a good handsome wench as my servant, put her into reputable lodgings, and buy every thing necessary for her myself; and by these means fix her my own at an easy rate. Here was the surgeon's bill saved, and my constitution kept whole and sound for matrimony, if ever fate should throw a wife, with ten thousand pounds, in my way. I made every lady a compliment, but seldom accompanied it with any other present than a kiss. Would you, Jack, pursue the same prudent method, you would find the benefit of it; but I am afraid you are resolved to buy experience dear."</span></p><p>Jack heard this admonition with a sheepishness natural enough to the choice spirits of the city, when they are under the rod of correction: but the old gentleman producing a bill at the end of his harangue, Jack's countenance brightened up; he received it, and bowing respectfully, stammered<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e97968">[Page 152]</span> out,<span class="q"> "'Tis very true, Sir, as you say, Sir."</span></p><p>After lying in the shop three months and four days, (I always endeavour to be precise in my chronology, as it gives the reader assurance, that the history is really and <span class="hi">bona fide,</span> true) one of my rays by an accident, began to be a little tarnished: this was a terrible misfortune, as in consequence of it, I was degraded to the glass-case at the door. I now gave way to the most violent emotionsof despair, and thought my splendor irretrievable; saw all my hopes of rising in the polite world vanished; and expected never to be relieved, till the day of transmutation, from my disgraceful situation. But fate had kinder days in store for me. The first object that claimed my attention in the street, was the superb chair of Mrs. Spermacety, the wax-chandler's wife. Her chairmen were loaded with silver lace; and the footman who cleared the way, had an enormous bag wig. I expected to have seen it filled with the dignity of a duchess; but how great was my astonishment, when I perceived a short, fat woman, of the same complexion as the sign of the Saracen's Head fastened in it! She was dressed meanly rich, without the shadow of elegance<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e98733">[Page 153]</span> in any thing but her chair, which had formerly belonged to a lady of quality, having purchased it at her decease. Her sneaking pitiful countenance did not discover one grain of generosity or nobility: she appeared an absolute burlesque on the grandeur which surrounded her. The following dialogue between Mr. Spangle and his good friend and neighbour Mr. Pickle let me into her whole history. <span class="q"> "Good morning to you, neighbour Spangle, as the man said; methinks Mrs. Spermaceti shines to-day."</span><span class="q"> "She shines every day, at home and abroad, Mr. Pickle: but there may be reasons for it; and the grey mare is sometimes the better horse."</span>This stroke, though in my opinion not very brilliant, brought a horselaugh on both sides for about ten minutes. <span class="q"> "You are a wit, neighbour, you are a wit; but they say, as how, that Mrs. Spermaceti was formerly her husband's cook-maid; but lies and snow-balls gather in rolling; pray is there any truth in the matter?"</span><span class="q"> "Between ourselves, there is a great deal of truth in it; and the first charm that Mr. Spermaceti found in his spouse, was that she dressed ortolans to a miracle."</span>Another loud laugh of applause echoed to the end of the street. <span class="q"> "And they say, Mr. Spangle, as how, that she lost three<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e99528">[Page 154]</span> thousand pounds one night at the gaming table to lord what-ye-callum — lord Dillitanti; is that true?"</span><span class="q"> "Very true, upon my word; for Tom Shamwell, who now lives by his wit, stood behind her chair, to let him into her hand, as they call it."</span><span class="q"> "Well, the Lord help us all, it is a sad thing to ha<span class="gap" title="illegible">•</span>e a spending wife, who consumes all the money before we gets it. "</span></p><p>This edifying discourse was terminated by a hearty shake of the hand, and an invitation from both parties to partake of a bottle of wine. I had now remained exposed to public view for about three weeks, and had caught the eye of every staring countryman, who did honour to my fallen brightness, by exclaiming,<span class="q"> "Odzounds! what a woundy pretty thingamy!"</span>Fortune at last began to smile, and my deliverance from disgrace was effected in the following manner.</p><p>Father L'Andridella was at the time of the intended assassination of the king of Portugal treasurer to a principal college of the order of Jesus, in the city of Lisbon. He was the intimate friend and considant of Malagrida; and assisted him in composing those ridiculous whimsies which the Inquisition<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e100244">[Page 155]</span> condemned as heretical. He was also deep in the important secret; and when the conspiracy began to unravel, was happy enough to escape the flames which Malagrida and the other conspirators perished in. The inhumanity with which the innocent families of the only two noble conspirators were treated, is too shocking to be dwelt upon.</p><p>Andridella went first to Paris, where he was employed by St. Florentin to bear certain presents to certain ministers in England, on a pacific account: but he demanding more for his trouble than St. Florentin chose to give, he was threatened with being confined for life in the Bastile; which threat would have been actually carried into execution, had he not timely got away to England.</p><p>How a certain physician came by his intelligence, shall be known in due time.</p><p>Andridella, for reasons best known to himself, shifted his habit, and equipped himself as a pedlar. Being a man of an extensive genius, and great knowledge in chemistry, he prepared several tinctures, for taking spots out of linen, recovering<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e100852">[Page 156]</span> tarnished gold or silver, and other ingenious <span class="hi">minutiae. </span>In one of his diurnal rotations, he called on Mr. Spangle, and imparted to him the virtues of his box. I was accordingly taken down to bear witness to the excellence of his tincture; and on the touch of his brush moistened by it shone forth with redoubled lustre, which, by a natural sympathy glittered also in the eyes of Mr. Spangle. Andridella was paid generously, and I was once more carefully laid up in the shop; but my stay there was very short; for Mr. Buckram, the taylor, gave me the preference before twenty of my brethren, and fixed me to a magnificent suit of cloaths, which were conveyed to B—n house, for the use of a young d—, just stepped into his estate and title.</p><p>The duke of D—e was the nobleman upon whose breast I commanded respect. Paracelsus, and that ingenious astrologic physician, Culpeper, assert, that gold and silver have a magic virtue. The magic of this virtue, commercially considered, is interest; physically, it is chimerical; and metaphisically, it is a fine subtle genius or spirit, as capable of reasoning upon matter, as any deist since Bolingbroke. By the magic of my composition,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e101583">[Page 157]</span> I was enabled to look internally into the bosoms which I adorned externally, and had no reason to be dissatisfied with my situation, as his grace's heart was no dishonour to his star. He was young, and had his foibles; the principal of which was a strong passion for gaming. Reason in vain endeavoured to convince him of his error; had he been convinced, his resolution would have been too feeble to bear him through in a reformation. The first time I adorned him, I visited the court; after the levee was over, he was accosted by Lord Rattle,<span class="q"> "Ah, D—e, how the devil d'ye do to day? I was horridly dipp'd last night; thirteen bottles of champaigne, demme. Lord Shuffle was bit this morning of three thousand; and has sent to his steward to cut down a whole forest to have a better stock to proceed upon. Pray, have you seen C—d's Letters?"</span><span class="q"> "O horrid! don't mention the stuff; I sicken at the idea. Lady Bab Blouzy has had the vapours these five days by perusing as many lines.

Trims a sentiment like a bag-wig, and twists a meaning like a curl."</span>I admired his lordships prudence, in making his valet a secretary, as it was more than probable he was better qualified for the office than his honourable master.</p><p>In the evening, I accompanied the duke to the gaming-table; my lustre sickened, and my whole frame trembled, at beholding the knot of rascals and villains, who surrounded him. Some he honoured with a nod; and others he condescended to enter into a conversation with; and then with an air of careless indifference, sat down to play, and before he rose, lost above eight thousand pounds. This loss but very little affected him, and he went home with the same composure of mind he brought out with him. The sharpers who shared the booty, were Sir Richard —, lord M—, Jack Hounslow, and father Andredilla, whose ingenuity had raised me to my present exalted station. Sir Richard had a legal claim to his title, but no man could disgrace it with more villanies or meannesses. His humble soul stooped to every thing when interest was in the way, and his tender conscience never gave him any trouble about the matter. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e103116">[Page 159]</span>Though lord M—, and this conscientious knight of the post, were continually quarrelling every were else, they always agreed at the gamingtable, in a very capital point, viz. to bubble his grace. His grace was so easy, so superficially learned in the art of gambling, and his antagonists so cunning and deep in the mystery, that B—n-house was more than once on the verge of being sold, to pay these inpostors what the world calls debts of honour. Lord M—, who though young, yet enervated with pleasure, had still a hankering desire to be sacrificing on the altar of the Cytherean goddess; and, by the infallibility of a bank-bill, had gained admittance into the chamber of Miss R—rs, the baronet's mistress. His lordship was making his addresses, when Sir Richard made his appearance: as the baronet was a man of prudence, and knew how to make use of an opportunity, he proposed to his lordship, that if he should be permitted to partake of the profits arising from his grace, and an eminent East-India bubble, his lordship should partake in common with the baronet in the charms of Miss R — rs. Lord M — stretched his gallantry to the utmost, and complied: and it was upon this consideration that the baronet had admittance to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e103865">[Page 160]</span> the gaming table. Jack Hounslow was his lordship's understrapper; he had been an upholsterer, but having squandered his stock, and nothing being left but a pair of pistols, he employed them to the most profitable advantage, by levying contributions on the highway. The frequent executions of his fellow labourers striking a damp upon his spirits, and having now pretty well recruited his pockets, he gave up his hazardous employment and commenced sharper. Lord M — soon discovered his inventive genius and useful parts, and engaged him in his service.</p><p>Sir Kenelm Digby, who so religiously maintained the doctrine of sympathy, would have attributed his lordship's discovery to similar feelings in his own breast. But as many tedious and learned arguments may be brought to maintain it, and to say but little in a case of importance, is worse than nothing at all, and for other good causes and considerations, I shall leave it entirely to the reader.</p><p>Father Andredilla having acquired a considerable sum by his tinctures, put himself into a magnificent dress, hired three servants, and assuming the title of marquis de Villa Garcia, completed the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e104526">[Page 161]</span> party who were continually preying upon the inexperience of the duke. One morning, lord Rattle came thundering in upon his grace,<span class="q"> "O, D — e, I shall die with risibility. Never was such a comical figure, demme; no masquerade face can be half so laughable.

As I had lived my usual time among the great, I submitted to my fate without murmuring. A black velvet coat and waistcoat, my near neighbours, were taken down to give physical dignity to a young fellow who had newly commenced quack-doctor; and found out a nostrum to cure distempers which never existed. This suit had once adorned a genius of the same profession, whose extraordinary operations in Moorfields, had made him the envy of all Hatton-Garden. Doctor Bialini, the original wearer, was quite an Esculapius in his way; he was unacquainted with every principle in surgery: but having as much courage and impudence, as ignorance, he boldly undertook the most difficult operations. When he happened to divide an artery in the cure of a scratch, it was all very well; and he had discovered by experience, that diverting the distemper to the nobler parts, was an infalliable cure, for inconsiderable ailments. He couched for the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e106090">[Page 163]</span> cataract, and where he cured one by chance, he made twenty totally blind, beyond all possibility of recovery. But success did not always attend his adventure; a young lady of great family applying to him to be eased of a troublesome pain in the head, he gave her such a dose of his cathartic pills, that she expired under their operation. The friends of the deceased accused the doctor of murder, and left it to his choice either to take a dose of his own cathartics, or leave England to return no more. As he knew the merit of his medicaments too well to chuse the first, he returned to Italy, to exercise his honester occupation of a taylor. His solemn habiliments were now disposed of to his successor in fame, Mr. Perron, who had been educated a cobler, and on the merit of being twice salivated, advertised to cure a certain distemper in all its extensive branches. The regular surgeons have had no reason to complain of his success; as he has greatly increased the business of the faculty, by confirming the disease, and ruining the constitution in every patient he undertook to cure. The warehouse I was laid up in was greatly frequented by second-hand gentry, among whom I heard many entertaining discourses, but too foreign from my purpose to be related here. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e106874">[Page 164]</span>A servant enquiring for a rich suit with a star, I was accordingly taken down, approved of, and carried off. I wondered what use I was going to be put to, when a meagre tall old man made his appearance. <span class="q"> "Well done, my bra' bonny laddie, this is saving the siller, and laying up more for the bairn."</span>These words were uttered by the identical duke of A —, who putting on his prudent finery, stepped into a coach, as antiquated as hospitality, and rattled off to court. The reception he met with from his M —, would have shamed virtue out of countenance: when we see villany and avarice caressed, what shall we say, but that k — s are men. His only merit was in being born a Scot, and distantly related to lord B —. I had examined his breast, and found him nothing but a composition of pride, fraud and avarice. As he was deep in all his favoured countryman's secrets, the affair of the peace was not unknown to him, and he had no inconsiderable share of the booty. Not contented with his share, he revealed the transaction to a certain western physician, binding him by oath, not to discover from whom he had his intelligence; and articling to receive a moiety of whatever should be given the doctor to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e107670">[Page 165]</span> stop his mouth, or say nothing at all to the purpose. The whole juggle was transacted entirely to the duke's satisfaction: and he partook so gloriously of the hush-money, that for a moment emerging from his usual avarice; he gave his servants new liveries, and matched one of his horses, having before paired a bay and a black one. The nobility did not receive him so well as his M —; as he was universally looked upon as a scandal to his title, he was shunned by every polite company. Unfortunately, the too retentive memory of a gentleman, discovered his grace's cloaths to have been worn by a more honourable nobleman; and having whispered his discovery to lady Henrietta F—h. as a very great secret; it was known all over the town before the evening, that the duke of A — had been to court in the duke of D — 's cast-off cloaths. Nothing can express the vexation of the old duke; his pride, which had stooped to his avarice, in the purchase of his prudent bargain, began, though too late, to have the pre-eminence; he ordered his servant to bear me back to Monmouth-street, and desire the fripperyman to refund the money, which he did, after deducting a guinea for the use of his magnificence. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e108433">[Page 166]</span>I was now taken off the coat, and condemned to the melting-pot; but whilst the executioner is preparing my siery grave, I have time to subscribe myself,</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">The public's humble servant, A STAR.</div></div></section></div><li><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-38" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-38">To the Printer of the Town and Country MAGAZINE.</a></li><div class="collapse" id="collapse-38"><section class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.32"><header><h1><span class="head">To the <span class="hi">Printer</span> of the <span class="hi">Town</span> and <span class="hi">Country</span> MAGAZINE.</span></h1></header><div class="opener"><div class="salute">SIR,</div></div><p>AS there are few monthly productions so universally read as your agreeable Miscellany, I have taken the liberty to beg the insertion of the following short account of my life, in which I shall be as brief as possible; and which, if you think proper to countenance, may be a means to warn others of my sex from falling into the same unhappy snares, which I now fatally experience have been my ruin.</p><p>My parents were people of some repute, for my father enjoyed a place under the government of upwards of two hundred pounds a year, besides a small estate in the country, which brought him in about a hundred and fifty pounds a year more. As I was their only daughter, they naturally took the best care of my learning that their income would permit, and I was sent early to a boarding school, where I received the rudiments of a polite<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e109116">[Page 168]</span> education, and made as great progress in French, music, &amp;c. as could reasonably be expected.</p><p>I was in my thirteenth year when my father died of a fever, and as he had been no great oeconomist, and the estate which he enjoyed was to leave our family at his death, my poor mother and I were left without the least resource. Grief for the loss of a tender and affectionate husband, soon put an end to my mother's distress; and I was now the only one left to suffer for the faults of my poor father's imprudence. It happened I had a near relation who was married to a gentleman of fortune, who pitying my situation, took me home with her to be a companion. By the chearfulness of my disposition, and my universal assiduities to please, I ingratiated myself so much in the favour of my cousin and Mr. M —, and received for it such convincing proofs of their friendship and desire to make me happy, that I soon forgot the loss I had so lately sustained. Mr. and Mrs. M — were extremely good-natured and affable, and I enjoyed every felicity I could wish for in my dependent state. Unluckily for me, Mrs. M — was threatened with a consumption, just as I had attained my fifteenth year, which daily increasing,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e109889">[Page 169]</span> in about six months, terminated a life, the loss of which I have now the utmost reason to lament; but not before she had recommended me to the care of Mr. M — in such terms that none but a wretch abandoned to all manner of villainy could have ever forgot.</p><p>I felt every emotion of grief which a heart truly susceptible of gratitude could experience at such a shock; but my concern was soon alleviated by the assurances I received from my surviving benefactor of a continuance of that protection and esteem I had hitherto met with. By his genorosity I was rendered sole mistress of his house, and had every indulgence granted which I could expect. As he had no children, he took me frequently with him, for an airing in the chariot, and though I observed his fondness for me, daily increase, I did not suffer the least suspicion to enter my breast. Being of an age in which young women are initiated in company, and as I was to move in a more genteel sphere, than formerly, I was no longer to be supported in my present character, but at a considerable expence, so that he spared no cost to make me appear suitable to that rank in which he placed me.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e110625">[Page 170]</span><p>By this stratagem, which I did not at first understand, he filled me with additional tenderness and gratitude; compelled me to repose on him as my only support; and by my sense of his favour, and the desire of retaining it, disposed me to unlimited complaisances. At last the wretch took advantage of the familiarity which he enjoyed as my relation, and the submission which he exacted as my benefactor, to attempt the ruin of an orphan, whom his indulgence had melted, and his authority had subdued. Shocked at the baseness of his designs, I summoned all the courage which a weak woman could employ, and resented his behaviour with a becoming indignation. But instead of recoiling at the deed, he upbraided me with ingratitude, and mingled his artifices with menaces of total desertion, if I should continue to resist.</p><p>I was now completely depressed, and though I had seen mankind enough to know the necessity of outward chearfulness, I often withdrew to my chamber to vent my grief, and examine by what means I might escape perpetual mortification. The loss of my indulgent parents and kind cousin were<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e111281">[Page 171]</span> now severely felt; and I only reflected that had I been taught a more useful kind of learning than a boarding-school produces, I might still live secure under the consciousness of an unblemished reputation. Unaccustomed and unexperienced to earn my bread in a menial capacity, I had no hopes lest but such as might proceed from his future honour and genorosity. I soon found myself cruelly deceived; no art or cunning was left untried to accomplish his purpose; the most subtle protestations of protection and maintenance were made use of, and a solemn promise of marriage to silence all my fears.</p><p>Oh! Woman, woman, thy name is frailty!</p><p>Young and credulous, I swallowed the glittering bait, and fell an easy victim to the unruly passion of an ungrateful wretch.</p><p>But, alas! When he found the consequences attendant on our crime, which I tremble to relate, he not only refused to fulfil his promise of marriage; but also abandoned me to all the pangs of recollection, and the frowns of a merciless world. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e111889">[Page 172]</span>Yet villain as he was, he did not turn me out of doors, till he had given me money to support me in those moments of perturbation, which his passion had forced me to suffer; and an untimely birth at length relieved me from the anxieties of a mother, though it left me under the severe pressures of infamy, and the painful prospect of approaching poverty.</p><p>Friends and acquaintances have now forsaken me, and I am reduced to the lot of those unhappy beings, from whom many, who melt at the sight of all other misery, think it meritorious to withhold relief; whom the rigour of virtuous indignation dooms to suffer without complaint, and perish without regard; and whom I myself have formerly insulted in the pride of reputation, and security of innocence.</p><p>Let others, who read my story, be warned by my example; and however specious the pretence, avoid the consequences.

Though it can afford me no pleasure to recite the many sufferings of a wretched victim to misfortune; yet, by my errors, others may be convinced that the way of virtue only, is the way to felicity. Born to an elevated rank in life, I was instructed rather to value myself on the blind acquisitions of fortune, and the tinsel of external accomplishments, than on the more solid and commendable qualifications of the mind. My years of infancy were marked by an infant pride; and the mercenary disposition of menial servants did not fail to make the evil increase with my growth.</p><p>When I just entered my sixteenth year, I was initated into all the oeconomy of high life. Should the rustic or mercantile reader find fault with the expression <span class="hi">oeconomy,</span> when applicable to high life,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e113271">[Page 175]</span> his ignorance is seen in the censure. Dames of spirit have their mean savings; and a titled lady is as anxiously avaricious in her way, as any plodding citizen whose business and pleasure unite in gain. Most of the estates of our nobility are heavily mortgaged, or lie useless to the owner, till the rent clears the incumbrances; this is all that can be urged in defence of a lady of quality's sharping upon her servant, and slripping her fille de chambre of all her ready cash, to answer some urgent demand upon her honour; which she protests, by that sacred honour, shall be returned with interest in a few days. But, alas! Among quality, things equally as sacred as honour are abused and trifled with. If there is any real spirit in high life, any generous indifference as to the affairs of this world, which should constitute the sole merit of <span class="hi">noblesse,</span> it is oftener found in a citizen's wife. However the court may exclaim against the city, there is less mercenary meanness in the dames of Ludgate-Hill, than in a whole masquerade of right honourable dishonourables</p><p>But to return to my own story. Happy in the notion of the world, by being born to a title and a large fortune, it is not to be doubted that the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e114031">[Page 176]</span> coxcombs of the court were busy to ingratiate themselves in my favour, by genteely letting me know, they thought themselves very pretty fellows; some indeed went so far, as to assure me by the <span class="hi">lard,</span> and all that, that I was consumedly handsome, still keeping a distant view to the dear subject, self; and never lending a compliment, unless it might be returned to the maker. These shadows of men were my continual torment, being my settled, perhaps, prejudiced aversion.</p><p>Another class of lovers deserved rather my friendship, or my pity, than my love, these were men of sense, who, by the malice of their fortune, (or their stars, if you are an astrologer) had never risen in life to what their ambitious ideas aspired to.</p><p>As the customs of the world are, by the courtesy of it, allowed to be just, these men imagined every girl of conspicuous accomplishments, whose unexperienced heart they could deceive into love, their lawful prize. Dangerous is that lover who has more sense than virtue: his sense, when perverted, is the greatest evil he can possess. Fools are mere cyphers, they are like the air; when the arrow flies, no traces remain to tell its way; they<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e114769">[Page 177]</span> are like the sea, where every single impression is lost in multitudes of impressions. Though I easily defended myself against the egotisms and addresses of the coxcomb, I found it no easy task to ward off the assaults of the man of sense; his batteries are levelled at the heart, and where he has mutual youth to plead in his favour, seldom fails of carrying the day. In the early bloom of life, we are not ourselves; and I confess, had not pride been a more certain guard than virtue, my fortune would have fallen into the hands of the creditors of an unfortunate, but amorous author. However, this was an error of youth; and the passion fled with my experience and the absence of the bard. But, my God! Why did it fly! To make room for one which should torment me for years. Better had it been for me to live poor by the villany of another, than to be rich, great, and miserable by my own villany. But just heavens! I deserve it all.</p><p>I was in my nineteenth year, when the personal accomplishments of a young gentleman, of inferior rank and fortune to mine, a Mr. Knowles, first engaged my notice. I cannot say, I conceived a passion instantaneously for him; I was never so<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e115545">[Page 178]</span> romantic. I admired his manly figure, his easy air, and affable behaviour. In short, I wished to know him, which was going as far as a woman of prudence, could go upon first sight. I was then universally allowed to be a beauty; and was unhappy enough to engage his attention. If his person pleased, his conversation charmed me; I was now madly in love. A solid judgment, without the least cynical cast; a florid, easy manner of speech, without the least affectation; and a fluent tongue, without any impertinence, all inspired to make me so. From the minute of our conversation, we began an acquaintance, an ill-fated one for me. Mr. Knowles had never spoke of his passion, though his fine eyes expressed unutterable things: we were often together, and I did not think it an unhappy circumstance that no declaration had been made; for that chilling coldness, which, by the custom of the world, necessarily succeeds a declaration, till the matrimonial act is determined, must, to mutual lovers, be a ceremonious torment. In the ensuing spring, Mr. Knowles being in the country, as I was one morning playing on my harpsichord, my father came hastily into the room. <span class="q"> "My dear girl,"</span>said he, throwing his arm round my waist,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e116320">[Page 179]</span><span class="q"> "I am overjoyed; partake of my transports, and ease one part of them."</span></p><p>I replied,<span class="q"> "Whatever gives my father joy, must consequently be welcome to me."</span></p><p><span class="q"> "It is in your power,"</span>answered he,<span class="q"> "in your power alone, to insure this happiness to me. The earl of — has seen you; he likes, he loves you: he has this day offered proposals to me, and will settle more than your own fortune on you."</span></p><p>I was thunder-struck at this intelligence; I could hear no more: I fainted. My father was frighted; he called for help, and soon recovered me. Seeing me revive, he changed his tender solicitude to rage; called me an ungrateful, vile, disobedient wretch, in having engaged my affections to another, which he was sure was the case, without his consent; told me, I should marry his lordship in three days time, or turn out of his doors with nothing but what I could demand. Saying this, he flung out of the room, and left me to consult with Janet, my waiting woman, who was privy to my prepossession in favour of Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e117002">[Page 180]</span> Knowles. <span class="q"> "Oh, Janet!"</span>I exclaimed,<span class="q"> "was ever poor creature so suddenly plunged into the depth of misery!"</span><span class="q"> "Why, to be sure, madam,"</span>returned she,<span class="q"> "the matter is a little sudden; but as to misery, I have heard your honourable father say, that happiness and misery were both in our own hands. Suppose, madam, this affair had not hapened, would you ever have had Mr. Knowles?"</span><span class="q"> "No!"</span>replied I warmly,<span class="q"> "No! I would never have stooped below my birth."</span><span class="q"> "Why then, dear madam, if he is out of the question, who could you have better than an earl? It is true, he is old, but then you will have a man of quality, and have all your own fortune settled on you. For my part, I can see no reason to hesitate."</span>Weak as these reasons may appear, it was such cogency of argument that urged me to consent to be countess of —. Doubting the stability of the resolution, I hastened to put it into execution; and in one fatal minute did what ages of repentance could not undo. My lord was affable and kind; my father transported out of himself; and I was neither miserable nor happy, in a kind of negative existence, which, for want of a better name, we call the vapours, a latitudinary word, which, meaning every thing, means nothing. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e117848">[Page 181]</span>Mr. Knowles heard of our marriage: he flew on the wings of love. As I was sitting alone in my parlour, amusing myself with fruitless repentance, he burst in upon me, and giving me an inexpressible look, exclaimed,<span class="q"> "Oh, my Fanny!"</span>That short sentence, did more, than the bitterest reproach could have done: it threw me into agonies not to be described. At last I gathered strength enough to speak. <span class="q"> "Sir, since the laws of the world have have bound me to another, to whom my kind regards are due, they cannot now be yours."</span>This I murmured in articulations scarce to be understood: I knew not what I said. He started from his chair, and eagerly seizing my hand, exclaimed,<span class="q"> "And was there ever a possibility they could be mine!"</span>This reply embarrassed me greatly; I was all confusion and hurry, when my lord entered.</p><p>Nothing can paint the distraction of his features; lunacy itself could not be more enraged; he fiercely commanded Mr. Knowles to walk out of the house, without permitting him to speak, and returned to me with the countenance of a fury. <span class="q"> "Madam,"</span>said he,<span class="q"> "could you carry on your vile intrigues no where but in my house! But I<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e118600">[Page 182]</span> will take care for the future, you shall have no intrigues elsewhere."</span>Saying this, he left me, and never afterwards suffered me to stir out, but with an old woman, who served me in the office of a duenna.</p><p>Vexed at this barbarous treatment, I resented it like a woman of quality and spirit. I insisted on the dismission of my spy, and being left to my own liberty. This his lordship flatly refused. Madening with rage, I made an immediate assignation with Mr. Knowles, exerted my authority, sent back my guard, and flew in my own coach to the place of appointment.</p><p>When a woman has taken one false step, 'tis too late to think of receding; she is necessitated to go on. Jealousy is certainly the effect of love; yet it is a very troublesome effect, and only tends to make the possessor hated by the object he loves.</p><p>My husband's behaviour grew intolerable, and I was determined to leave him. This I did soon after with Mr. Knowles, and we retired to a neighbouring kingdom. Happy in not being disturbed, we thought his lordship sat easy under his<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e119273">[Page 183]</span> loss; when the first intelligence we had of him brought his will. Distracted at the fatal consequence of my resentment, I flew to the house once his, now mine, his generosity having left me all, laying the blame on the disparity of our ages, my prepossession, and his jealousy. Here had I the unhappiness to find my father dying, stabbed to the heart with the news of my flight.

I am, Mr. Editor, a Sad Dog, a very Sad Dog; have run through many sad adventures, had many sad escapes from the clutches of baliffs, and at the time of writing this sad relation, am throned in a broken chair within an inch of a thunder-cloud.</p><p>I set out in life with a fortune of five thousand pounds, which the old prig, my father, left me, with this memorable piece of advice:<span class="q"> "Item, I leave to my youngest son Henry, five thousand pounds, with an old book, formerly his grandmother Bridget's, called, The Way to save Wealth, containing a thousand choice receipts in cookery, &amp;c. and I advise that he read two pages of the said book every day before he dines."</span>Very pretty advice! but I had not veneration enough for the parental character to follow it.</p><p>When the legacy was paid me, I bid my brother adieu, drank three bottles of claret with Sir Stentor Ranger, who had married my sister, and drove furiously to the metropolis in my own phaeton and sour. Honour was the only book which I ever honoured with a perusal; and being pretty well dipped in the theory of gambling, I ventured to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e120731">[Page 186]</span> engage with some knights of the post, which were a little better versed in the practical part, and at one sitting lost one fifth of my fortune. This was a terrible stroke to me, and I began, for the first time in my life, to reflect; but a bottle of champaigne, and a night at the hotel, drove every troublesome idea out of my head.</p><p>Miss Fanny H — t, who by a natural transition is transmigrated from a whore into a bagniokeeper, was then in the bloom of her charms; she was never a first-rate beauty, but always a very favourite toast among the bucks and pretty fellows of the city.</p><p>I was one evening strolling the Park, when Miss Fanny had experience enough to perceive that she had nailed my attention. As I was neither acquainted with her character, or situation, I was not a little elated with the condescending glances she honoured me with. Presuming on my conquest, I made her a few compliments, 'squired her out of the Park, and thought myself blest in being permitted to accompany her to her lodgings. I had not enjoyed my tête-à-tête five minutes, before I was astonished at hearing the well-known<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e121440">[Page 187]</span> thunder of the voice of Jack N — tt. <span class="q"> "'Sblood and 'oons, you old harridan, she is mine for a month; and I would rather lose fifty per cent. than lend her for a single night to the dearest friend upon earth."</span>To this vociferous exclamation the venerable matron replied:<span class="q"> "Won't Miss Kitty do for once, or Polly, or Miss Nancy?"</span><span class="q"> "I'll have no Miss, but Fanny, by G —,"</span>replied Jack, bursting into the parlour upon us. I was now sufficiently in the secret, and not displeased at finding my charmer no vestal. Jack, who had paid fifty pounds for his month, insisted on his right of purchase; but Miss Fanny thinking me a better pay-master, heroically turned him out of the parlour; telling him, for his comfort, that he should have his month another time. Miss Fanny pleased me so well, that before I was weary of her I had sunk another thousand; when, in a fit of reflexion, I bid her adieu, and left her to Jack, and the rest of her monthly keepers.</p><p>To make a little digression, I think this method of hiring for a month preferable to the wholesale bargains for life, and of mutual advantage to the keeper and kept, if that form will stand good in law, for a man will find it all rapture and love,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e122253">[Page 188]</span> without disgust; and in a few months play the the same part over again, with no decay of vigour.</p><p>Jack N — tt is now a principal merchant, and rolls about in his coach and four to every public dinner; where his appetite and solidity of judgment, in the edible way, does honour to the city. It is notorious that he is a cuckold, and by more than one method free of his company; but that is no detriment to him in the scale of mercantile merit. The extraordinary bustle he has made in a late political affair, is very little to his advantage; but it must be observed in his defence, that the earl of H — lsb — h did him the greatest act of friendship mortal man could do him, viz. invited him to a turtle-feast, and revealed to him a secret in the culinary art, till then utterly unknown to all the world but his lordship and his cook. Some indeed pretended to say, that this secret is nothing more than giving venison an additional flavour, by basting it with a preparation of French cheese and rancid butter; but as I would not presume to give my opinion in a matter of such importance, I shall leave Jack to the pleasure of the table, and proceed in my relation.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e123023">[Page 189]</span><p>On this considerable decay of my fortune, I began to consider seriously of my departed father's curious advice; and in consequence of this consideration, resolved to set up for a fortune-hunter, and retrieve my affairs in the sober track of matrimony. A Miss L — n was the girl I had fixed upon, and accordingly dressed at. She raised my hopes, and gratified my vanity by several significant glances; and I was so certain of carrying her off in the end, that I chearfully launched out five hundred pounds in dress and equipage; which had such an amazing effect, that in three weeks time I had three kisses of her hand, and in the fourth week she took a trip to Scotland with her father's footman. This unexpected stroke created in me an absolute aversion to matrimony, and a resolution not to endeavour to better myself by the hymenial knot.</p><p>Soon after this affair I made an acquaintance with the wife of an alderman: I shall conceal his name, as his patriotic behaviour has rendered him respectable in the city. Mrs. — was of an amorous complexion: her husband had too much of the citizen to be like her: turtle, venison, and popularity, were the only objects of his attention,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e123755">[Page 190]</span> out of the compting-house. Though he has never repeated three periods with propriety, except when assisted by the ingenious device of placing the ready-made speech in the crown of his hat; yet his mercantile genius has often struck upon very lucky hits. He is unrivalled in reckoning the amount of rate per cent. and no stock-broker at Jonathan's can whisper a piece of secret intelligence with half his dexterity. Between you and I and the post, Mr. Editor, the stopping the circulation of bad halfpence, inconsiderable as the coin may appear to some, has brought him in no less than seven thousand pounds, and increased the trade of him and his partners amazingly.</p><p>Mrs. — had penetration enough to find out my good qualities; and you will suppose, that I was not wanting in acknowledging her partiality. We had frequent interviews at the house of a capital miliner in the Strand, and the amour for some time went swimmingly on.</p><p>Mrs. — was under no apprehensions of my being satiated with enjoyment? for generously considering I was but a younger brother, I never sacrificed on the altar of the Cyprean goddess,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e124410">[Page 191]</span> without receiving a bank-bill worth my acceptance. But, alas! happiness is of short duration; or, to speak in the language of the high-sounding Ossian,<span class="q"> "Behold! thou art happy; but soon, ah! soon, wilt thou be miserable. Thou art as easy and tranquil as the face of the green-mantled puddle; but soon, ah! soon, wilt thou be tumbled and tossed by misfortunes, like the stream of the water-mill. Thou art beautiful as the cathederal of Canterbury; but soon wilt thou be deformed like Chinese palace-paling. So the sun rising in the east gilds the borders of the black mountains, and laces with his golden rays the dark-brown heath. The hind leaps over the slowery lawn, and the reeky bull rolls in the bubbling brook. The wild boar makes ready his armour of defence. The inhabitants of the rocks dance, and all nature joins in the song. But see! riding on the wings of the wind, the black clouds fly. The noisy thunders roar; the rapid lightnings gleam; the rainy torrents pour, and the dropping swain flies over the mountain: swift as Bickerstaff, the son of song, when the monster Bumbailiano, keeper of the dark and black cave, pursued him over the hills of death, and the green meadows of dark men."</span>O, Ossian! immortal genius! what an invocation<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e125206">[Page 192]</span> could I make now! but I shall leave it to the abler pen of Mr. Duff, and spin out the thread of my own adventures.</p><p>Mrs. — having dispatched a billet to me, I flew to her in her own house. The knight, as she thought, was fixed to the table of Sir Tunbelly Grains, knight, citizen, and alderman, who had invited him to dinner on a delicious turtle: a blessing not to be neglected. But, Oh! grief of griefs! the knight having forgot his favourite tobacco-box, popped in upon us unexpectedly, and found us too familiarly engaged. Instead of bursting into the rage which might have animated an Italian or Spaniard on the occasion, he shook his head, and pronouncing coolly,<span class="q"> "Very fine, all very fine!"</span>he left us, and returned to Sir Tunbelly to finish the turtle. As by his hasty throwing open the door he had exposed us to the view of two of his servants, I was terribly afraid of a prosecution for <span class="hi">crim. con.</span> for though it was as fashionable then as it is now, I was not very eager to lose the remainder of my fortune fashionably. But the knight considering his reputation would receive a severe stroke, should the affair be made public, contented himself with demanding<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e125975">[Page 193]</span> two thousand pounds for the injury I had done him. As he threatened to prosecute for larger damages, unless I complied, I was obliged to refund more than Mrs. —'s bounty had bestowed upon me.</p><p>The old curmudgeon had heartily provoked me, and I resolved, though at the expence of every shilling I had, to be revenged on him. For this purpose I published the whole affair, and the devil assisting my invention, I struck upon another expedient to gratify my vengeance.</p><p>The knight's eldest daughter, Sabina, whom he had by a former wife, was a fine sprightly girl, and wanted nothing but the <span class="hi">bon ton</span> to render her perfectly accomplished; about eighteen, a remarkable fine complexion, and expressive blue eyes. She was at the time of the unlucky discovery with a relation in Essex: as I had formerly paid a few compliments to her beauty, which I had reason to say, without vanity, were not ill received, I instantly dispatched an epistle to her, the most tender my imagination could dictate. It wrought the effect I designed, and she returned an answer. After a long farce of lying and intriguing on my<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e126663">[Page 194]</span> part, and credulity on hers, I accomplished the grand end — you will guess what I mean.</p><p>We lived in love and rapture about a month, when her father bid her prepare to marry Mr. Lutestring, the mercer, by the next week. She flew to the usual place of assignation, bathed in tears, with a face expressive of the most violent grief.</p><p>I was now almost persuaded to love her in earnest; but I was a Sad Dog to suffer revenge (and when I seriously reflect, a revenge which had no foundation in reason) to get the better of every nobler passion.</p><p><span class="q"> "O! my dear Harry,"</span>exclaimed the beautiful unfortunate,<span class="q"> "let us fly immediately to Scotland, otherwise my father, inhuman man! will oblige me to marry Bob Lutestring next week."</span></p><p><span class="q"> "Bob Lutestring, my dear,"</span>replied I indifferently,<span class="q"> "is a substantial man, and I would not have you disoblige your father on my account."</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e127229">[Page 195]</span><p><span class="q"> "And is this your advice!"</span>returned the heroine, assuming a dignified air:<span class="q"> "be assured, Sir, I shall follow it."</span>Saying this, she flung from me; her ideas, I suppose, a little different from those she brought with her.</p><p>But I had not yet accomplished my revenge Steeled in impudence as I am, I blush to write the rest; but it shall be out. I informed Mr. Lutestring of my intimacy with his future spouse, and advised him not to unite himself to a woman of such principles. I made certain of receiving a challenge, and a string of curses for my information; but, alas! I knew not the city. <span class="q"> "Sir,"</span>replied the mercer,<span class="q"> "I thank you for your intelligence, this day received: but your advice is not worth a yard of tape; you say Sabina has been faulty; allow it: but will her father give me any thing the less for her fortune on that account? on the contrary, were not my notions of honour very refined, I might make it a means of raising my price."</span>I slunk away, astonished at this reply, reflecting how various are the species and refinements of honour.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e127948">[Page 196]</span><p>I was now just on the brink of poverty: I had made a considerable breach in my last five hundred; and began to shudder at the contempt with which the decay of my fortune threatened me. Relying on his former professions of friendship, I posted down to Sir Stentor Ranger, in hopes he would have assisted me. I found the knight very busy, with Sir Charles Banbury, in tracing the honourable pedigree of an Arabian barb. <span class="q"> "Hey, Hal,"</span>exclaimed the knight, with a voice which would have drowned the full chorus of a foxchace;<span class="q"> "what the devil brought thee here? I thought thou wert grown a gentleman, and had forgotten us all."</span>He received me with as much kindness and civility, as his rustic breeding would permit, and invited me to his antiquated hall.</p><p>After a noble dinner of venison, when Sir Charles had retired, on cracking the nineteenth bottle, I ventured to open the business. Nothing can express the surprise which distended the knight's ample countenance. I made no very agreeable comments on his astonishment; but, thank Heaven! those comments were as groundless as the Rev. Mr. Bentinck's on the Bible.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e128631">[Page 197]</span><p><span class="q"> "Zounds,"</span>thundered the knight,<span class="q"> "five thousand pounds gone already: you have been a Sad Dog, Hal, that I'll say for thee. But, howsundever, as thou beest my nown flesh and blood, d'ye see, I'll do something for thee.

There's my lord Grosvenor's filly, Long Dick; he would have it, that he was got by his own horse, Thunder, when I, by the mere make of his pastern, found 'um out, to be got by Sir George Blunt's white horse, Duke. Dost know any thing of dogs? Canst train a pointer, or a hawk, or such like things?"</div><p><span class="q"> "This,"</span>I replied,<span class="q"> "I could with safety undertake."</span></p><div class="q"> "Well then, zay no more; no more words to the matter: I'll do for thee; thou shalt have one hundred and fifty pounds a year, and so ge'es<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e129341">[Page 198]</span> thy hand, Hal. A bargain's a bargain; I scorn to flinch from my word: thou shalt ha'it, odzookers, thou shalt ha'it."</div><p>In consequence of this bargain I commenced superintendant of his stables and kennels. I discharged my office much to his satisfaction; and by dint of application acquiring some knowledge in the mysteries of the turf, I began to be of consequence in the racing world. Sir Stentor's hall was very ancient, and had been in days of yore a family seat of the Mowbrays. It had not undergone any considerable reparation since the Reformation; when an ancestor of Sir Stentor's, having often had quarrels with a neighbouring abbot, in the sacrilegious pillage, purchased his abbey for less than the one-twentieth of its value; and robbing it of all its ornaments and painted glass, made the abbey a stable, and turned his dogs into the chapel.</p><p>Sir Stentor had many curious visitors, on account of his antient painted glass-windows; among the rest was the redoubted baron Otranto, who has spent his whole life in conjectures. This most ingenious gentleman, as a certain advertiser stiles<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e129994">[Page 199]</span> him, is certainly a good judge of paintings, and has an original, easy manner of writing. That his knowledge in antiquity equals his other accomplishments may be disputed. As Sir Stentor had ever been politically attached to his family, he welcomed the the baron with every demonstration of joy, and ordered the bells of the parish church to be rung. As a further testimony of his joy, he sent for a blind fidler, the Barthelemon of the village, to entertain the baron with a solo during dinner; and after the desert, Robin Hood's Ramble was melodiously chaunted by the knight's groom and dairy-maid, to the excellent music of a twostringed violin, and a bag-pipe. A concert by the first masters in Europe could not have pleased the baron so well: he imagined himself carried back to the age of his favourite hero, Richard the Third.</p><p>Should any critic assert, that it is impossible such an imagination could enter the <span class="hi">cerebellum</span> of the baron, who confines all his ideas within the narrow limits of propriety (for the songs of Robin Hood were not in being till the reign of queen Elizabeth) his assertion shall stand uncontradicted by me, as I know, by woeful experience,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e130710">[Page 200]</span> that when an author resolves to think himself in the right, it is more than human argument can do to convince him he is in the wrong.</p><p>The baron, after dinner, asked the knight if he had ever discovered in any place about his house an escutcheon argent, on a fesse gules; three garbs, or; between as many shields, sable, cheveronny of the first?</p><p>To this learned interrogatory the knight answered with a stare of astonishment, and<span class="q"> "Anon, Sir, what d'ye talk of? I don't understand such outlandish lingo, not I, for my part."</span></p><p>Otranto finding it impossible to enter into a conversation suitable to his hobby-horse, begged leave to visit the kennel, desiring the knight to permit the huntsman to go with him, lest the dogs might not be over civil to a stranger.</p><p><span class="q"> "Odzookers,"</span>cried Sir Stentor,<span class="q"> "are you afraid of the dogs? I'll go with you myself, man."</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e131269">[Page 201]</span><p>The baron found many things worthy his notice in the ruinated chapel; but the knight was so full of the praises of his harriers, that the antiquary had not opportunity to form one conjecture. After looking round the chapel for some moveable piece of age, on which he might employ his speculative talents, to the eternal honour of his judgment, he pitched upon a stone which had no antiquity at all; and, transported with his fancied prize, placed it upon his head, and bore it triumphantly to his chamber, desiring the knight to give him no disturbance the next day, as he intended to devote it to the service of futurity.</p><p>This important piece of stone had by the huntsman been sacrilegiously stolen from the neighbouring church-yard, and employed with others to stop up a breach in the kennel, through which the adventurous Jowler had squeezed his lank carcase.</p><p>Nothing can escape the clutches of curiosity. The letters being ill cut, had an appearance of something Gothic; and the baron was so far gone in this Quixotism of literature, that at the first glance he determined them to be of the third Runic alphabet of Wormius.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e131953">[Page 202]</span><p>The original inscription was: James Hicks lieth here, with Hester his wife.</p><p>The broken stone is here represented,</p><div class="figure">

What confirmed him in the above reading, and made it impossible for him to be mistaken, was, that a great man of the name of Sancto Legero, had been buried in the county about five hundred years ago.</p><p>Elated with the happy discovery, the Baron had an elegant engraving of the curiosity executed, and presented it to the society of antiquaries, who look upon it as one of the most important discoveries which have been made since the great Dr. Trefoil found out, that the word <span class="hi">kine</span> came from the Saxon <span class="hi">co<span class="gap" title="illegible">•…</span>ice. </span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e132443">[Page 203]</span><p>When this miracle of literature left the village, the bells were again rung, and the baron was wrapped in Elysium on the success of his visit.</p><p>I had served Sir Stentor above two years, when, by a lucky hit, Sir Charles Banbury and myself took the whole field in, and cleared above twenty thousand pounds; eight thousand of which fell to my share.</p><p>I was now once more established in the world, and redeemed from the dependance which had mortified my pride.

But every other consideration was soon drowned in that of a young marchioness, who never met my eyes without telling them such a tale of love, that it was impossible not to understand it.</p><p>I directed my valet La Fosse, to make every possible enquiry after her: he brought me intelligence that she was the widow of a marquis, and of a very noble family. This was sufficient: I instantly dispatched a messenger of love to her: and 'ere another moon had gilded up her horns, married her. But I had cause to repent my expedition; she was indeed the widow of a marquis, but one of the poorest of that title in France; his debts were great, and his widow instead of discharging them, had contracted more, her noble family not being able to support her.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e133768">[Page 205]</span><p>I was soon rouzed from my dream of happiness, and thrown into prison; my fortune was insufficient to procure my liberty, and there I should have perished, had not an old rich farmer-general taken my wife under his protection, paid her debts, generously set me free, and presented me with a bill of two hundred pounds, on condition I returned to England. I did not chuse to reject his offer, and with that sort of pseudo-repentance, which generally waits on us when we are grown wise too late, took my leave of France and prosperity.</p><p>Immediately on my return to England, I waited on Sir Stentor; but the knight knowing my genius in horse-flesh, was not willing to put me in a condition of rivalling him upon the turf.</p><div class="q"> "Zounds, Hal, whoy thou spendest every thing: no, no, I duont want a top game-keeper now.

I was now in raptures, and saw once again the visions of good fortune swimming before my sight. I still continued improving my principal, when an account from Trieste reduced me to seven hundred; and in a few days after, another account from the same unfortunate place, utterly ruined me, and I waddled a lame duck out of the alley.</p><p>What could I now do?

Mr. Britannicus, at first imagining the piece was not to be paid for, was lavish of his praises, and I might depend upon it, it should do honour to his flaming patriotic paper; but when he was told that I expected some recompence, he assumed an air of criticism, and begged my pardon; he did not know that circumstance, and really he did not think it good language, or sound reasoning.</p><p>I was not discouraged by the objections and criticisms of the bookselling tribe; and as I know the art of Curlism, pretty well, I make a tolerable hand of it. But, Mr. Printer, the late prosecution against the booksellers having frightened them all out of their patriotism, I am necessitated either to write for the entertainment of the public, or in defence of the ministry. As I have some little remains of conscience, the latter is not very agreeable. Political writing, of either<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e135872">[Page 208]</span> side of the question, is of little service to the entertainment or instruction of the reader.

He wears also an enormous ruff, once the property of Sir Venison Goosepye, lordmayor of London, who, though of a younger branch of the family, established it on a more respectable footing than before, by doubling its rentroll. Gratitude obliges my sire to wear this ruff, though as full of holes as a lawyer's conscience. A flashed doublet, with slit sleeves, and a long cloak, envelopes his trunk; and a monstrous pair of trunk-hose, square shoes, and large shoe-roses, conclude his bundle of ridiculous habiliments. Could I persuade him to be contented with making himself laughed at, I should be happy in entertaining my friends with the oddity of his appearance; but when I consider that mine is equally<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e137475">[Page 211]</span> as laughable, I sicken at the sight of his antiquated garb. I am almost ashamed to describe myself; but in hopes that he must soon set out on his journey to the other world, I make a virtue of necessity, and comply. He absolutely threatens to disinherit me, if I grumble at dressing for the memory of the departed; and an estate of six-thousand <span class="hi">per annum,</span> is not to be lost for the sake of a fulltrimmed suit, and a gold button. My hair is dressed in a very peculiar and risible manner; it is cut close on the middle of the head, and twisted like a horse's mane on each side: this my papa avers was the most polite fashion in the reign of queen Elizabeth, as appears by the portrait of his great uncle, Sir Henry Dainty. This Sir Henry was the greatest beau of his time, and is thought by a learned antiquary to be the identical person for whom Shakespeare drew the character of Ostrick in Hamlet. My hat is not quite so comical as my sire's; it inclines more to the shape of a closestool-pan, pardon the simile, you will find it in another author, it is too delicate to be my own. This ornament of the head once graced the <span class="hi">caput</span> of the profound Dr. Technicus, who had an universal nostrum which enabled him to ride in his chair; and what do you think this nostrum was? <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e138323">[Page 212]</span>Nothing but a cataplasm of masticated bread and butter. My ruff is perfectly yellow: but as it belonged to the reverend Dr. Drouzy, my father makes it a point of conscience to oblige me to wear it. I have a large jutting coat and wide breeches, the very tip of the mode in the days of Henry VII. mottled stocking, red and green, and shoes with monstrous pikes complete my ornamentals.</p><p>This, Mr. Printer, is a perfect representation of my externals. Do be so obliging as to give the old fellow a hint in your Magazine, that he acts very ridiculously. He has already felt the bad effects of his antiquated wardrobe. My sister was as laughable as myself; she wore a hood of unconscionable thick velvet, which projected on each side of her face, like a horse's blinds; her ruff was enormous, and betwixt that and her head-gear there was nothing but the tip of her nose to be seen: her stays reached down to her knees, her stockings were yellow, and her shoes square-toed. All these ornaments had in the days of their prosperity, glittered on Alice Sevenoke, a maid of honour to queen Mary, who was famous for making custards, and giving eel-pies an excellent relish. My sister Biddy's gown was as heavy as<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e139079">[Page 213]</span> a modern novel: upon a moderate computation it had above three pounds of silver, in its embroidery: the colours indeed were faded, but that defect was made up in the lenghth of the train, which afforded the cat a five minutes play while Miss Biddy was turning the corner.</p><p>A female must necessarily be worse qualified to bear this purgatory than a man; and she having fifteen thousand pounds, which an old aunt had left her to be paid at her marriage, whipped off to Scotland, at the age of sixteen, with a young fellow in the army.

So much for internal merit. The young fox-hunters in the neighbourhood swear I am a woundy pretty maid! The politer sort protest before gad, I am<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e148133">[Page 229]</span> an angel; and Madame Gouvernante, tells me, I am very fair, very elegant, and every way accomplished. You will excuse this description of myself, as it is a true, though trite observation, that few readers regard any history 'till they are minutely acquainted with the author: my intention in writing, was to ask your advice. Now you must know Mr. Ham, that I have ten thousand pounds, at my own disposal; a qualification, which may, in your opinion, exceed all the others I value myself upon. My father, who is a plodding sort of a man, and upon Bristol exchange, (or rather in the street) has the character of a rich merchant, who knows how to live in the world, designs to marry me to Bob Barter, the hopeful son of his good friend Hezekiah Barter. Bob is, in the polite language of Bristol, a devil of a buck. You may see him in the morning, sitting under a shed on the key, registering the weight of sugars, and in the evening shining at a ball. He overturns a basket of oysters, or beats a dog, with a better grace than any youthful notary of Bacchus, in that elegant city: the cream of politeness. As Madame Gouvernante knows my father's intentions, she very readily permits his intrusions, and takes every opportunity to leave<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e148942">[Page 230]</span> us together. The wretch has never read further than the Gazette, or tables of interest; so that it is impossible to receive a compliment worth accepting from him. He seems to look upon me as already married, and treats me with a suitable indifference. Upon the exit of the Gouvernante, he claps on his hat, takes a turn round the room, very politely exposes his backside to the fire, and remarks it is very cold, or something of equal importance. I never regard the wretch; but if I am reading, consider myself as alone, and read on. Pray, Mr. Hamilton, is such a contemptible being, to be treated with more respect? Having told you, I do not like this uncivilized Bristolian, you may imagine a <span class="hi">tendresse</span> for some other has made his faults more conspicuous. You will not be far from the truth. A young author who has read more than, Magliabechi, and wrote more love-letters than Ovid, is continually invoking the nine to describe me; but he never pays a compliment to my person, without a concomitant one to my understanding. Though I have ten thousand pounds, he never mentions marriage; and when it is forced into his discourse, rails at it most religiously: but he intrigues like a Jesuit, to be made happy with a <span class="hi">téte à téte</span> conversation,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e149735">[Page 231]</span> or a walk in the wood; but, thank my stars! I have always courageously denied. He has sentiment in his common conversation; and is reported to have ruined three young ladies of fortune. Pray, Mr. Hamilton, what am I to do in this case? Nothing can be more disagreeable than this boarding-school: If I am obliged to marry that insignificant wretch, Bob Barter, will the forced ceremony oblige me to hate my literary lover? Your advice will oblige</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Yours, &amp;c.

Sladon, a merchant of Bristol, by industry and diligent application to business, acquired a considerable fortune. As he was an enemy to noise and pomp, he neither set up his carriage, nor endeavoured to make a splended appearance; his only care centered in Maria, his beautiful daughter: he spared no costs to complete her education; her genius requited his labour; no instructions were lost on her, and she excelled in every qualification, which dignify her sex. At the age of seventeen she was universally allowed to be a beauty. The reader will excuse the writer from giving a description of her person; let him cull from the volumes of poets and painters, all his imagination counts beautiful, and throw into it an inexpressible softness, and he has Maria.</p><p>Mr. Hinckley, whose father was closely connected in trade with Mr. Sladon, struck with the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e152211">[Page 236]</span> uncommon lustre of Maria's person and mind, intreated his father, to permit him to pay his addresses to her. <span class="q"> "George,"</span>said the priest of Mammon,<span class="q"> "I commend your choice, Miss Sladon is a very good oeconomist, and will have little less than a plumb to her fortune: go, and prosper."</span>Young Hinckley assured his father he had not the least mercenary view. <span class="q"> "Away,"</span>replied the old man<span class="q"> "when you have been as often upon 'Change as me, you'll know better."</span></p><p>Young Hinckley had no cause to complain of his reception; Maria had never viewed him with eyes of indifference. Mr. Sladon rejoiced at the proposed alliance; all was unity and love, and before the expiration of two months, George acquainted his father, that he intended to request Mr. Sladon to fix the day; but was thunderstruck with his command, that he should not go such lengths till he had further orders from him.</p><p>Mr. Sladon, who was himself above deceit, never suspected it in another; his generous frankness laid him open to the vile arts of old Hinckley: after being connected together, the space of a year, he broke, and ruined him.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e152910">[Page 237]</span><p>Maria had by this time conceived the most tender passion for young Hinckley: it was allowable, as she had always considered him as her future husband. No words can describe Hinckley's excess of love. Imagine what an effect this stroke must have upon both. Nothing but imagination can paint it.</p><p>Mr. Sladon was only affected for his daughter: his noble soul rose superior to this revolution; he triumphed in poverty, over the wealthy wretch who caused his misfortunes. Old Hinckley, whose fortune was increased, not dimished by this infamous action, perceived with chagrin, his son's madness for Maria; he endeavoured to divert his attention to objects more rich, and therefore, in his opinion, more deserving: but he laboured in vain; nothing could abate his love. Mr. Sladon saw his passion; he pitied him: but could not think of uniting his daughter to a man, whose superiority of circumstances, was derived from his own ruin.</p><p>Old Hinckley, finding all remonstrances useless, by some mercenary agents, persuaded Mr. Sladon that young Hinckley was privy to, and assisting in his ruin. The circumstances made it plausible;<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e153564">[Page 238]</span> he believed it, and forbade him his house. Maria would have credited it of any other man; in this case it was dubious: her love for him was partial; but as she had looked upon the father formerly in the best light, she doubted whether she might not be deceived in the son. She was in this wavering opinion, when the only servant Mr. Sladon had, brought her a letter from young Hinckley: she knew the hand, she eagerly caught it; she recollected, and dropped it on the ground: after a long struggle between duty and love, she sent it back unopened. When a person of good sense and strong natural parts, has not the happiness of a religious education, he is generally a Deist or Socinian. This was the case with young Hinckley; his father endeavouring to qualify him for commerce, neglected Christianity: to the most refined notions of honour and morality, he united an absolute contempt for religion; his passions were violent, but as he was continually on his guard, they seldom appeared. When he heard that Maria had returned his letter, he raved to the utmost extravagance of madness; then appearing calm, he sat down, and writing a letter, sealed it and left it on the table. Having done this, he went into his chamber, and immediately shot himself.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e154357">[Page 239]</span><p>Old Hinckley hearing the explosion, ran from his compter, and ascending the stairs, saw his son extended breathless. He fainted, and continued in that condition, till his servants, occasionally coming in, recovered him.</p><p>The letter, which was directed to his father, contained what follows.</p><div class="floatingText"><div class="floatingText_body"><p>I shall not accuse your conduct, for you are my father; I shall only endeavour to vindicate the action I am about to perpetrate. This will be easily done. There is a principle in man (a shadow of the Divinity) which constitutes him the image of God; you may call it conscience, grace, inspiration, the spirit, or whatever name your education gives it. If a man acts according to this regulator, he is right: if contrary to it, he is wrong. It is an approved truth, that this principle varies in every rational being. As I can reconcile suicide to this principle, with me it is consequently no crime. Suicide is sometimes a noble insanity of the soul: and often the result of a mature and deliberate approbation of the soul. If ever a crime it is only so to society; there indeed it always appears an irrational emotion: but when<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24354e155065">[Page 240]</span> our being becomes dissocial, when we neither as<span class="gap" title="illegible">•</span>ist, or are assisted by society, we do not injure it by laying down our load of life. It may seem a paradoxical assertion, that we cannot do wrong to ourselves; but it is certain we have power over our own existence. Such is my opinion, and I have made use of such power.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">GEORGE HINCLEY.</div></div></div></div><p>This seeming philosophy was lost on old Hinckley; he was really affected with the loss of his son, and did not survive him three months.</p><p>Maria! the beautious Maria, had a still shorter date. She heard the fatal news; and expired within a week. — Mr. Sladon loved his daughter too well to live without her; he compleated the tragedy, and sunk to the grave, resigned and contented amidst the chastisements of Providence.</p></section></div><li id="o4039-w0220" style="text-indent:0;"><a href="/works/o4039-w0220.shtml"><em>ELEGY, TO THE MEMORY OF MR.
