fragment.

so here confine, and but to female clay,
 ardelia's soul mistake the rightful way:
 while the soft breeze of pleasure tempt air
 make she believe, felicity be there;
 and bask in the warmth of early time,
 to vain amusement dedicate her prime. 
ambition next allure her tower eye;
 for paradise she hear be place on high,
 then think, the court with all its glorious show
 be sure above the rest, and paradise below. 
there place too soon the flame sword appear,
 remove those power, who just she revere,
 adhere too in their wreck, and in their ruin share. 
now by the wheel inevitable round,
 with they throw prostrate to the humble ground,
 no more she take (instruct by that fall)
 for fix, or worth her thought, this roll ball:
 towards a more certain station she aspire,
 unshaken by revolt, and own no less desire. 
but all in vain be prayer, ecstatic thought,
 recover moment, and retract fault,
 retirement, which the world moroseness call,
 abandon pleasure in monastic wall:
 these, but at distance, towards that purpose tend,
 the lowly mean to a exalt end;
 which he must perfect, who allot her stay,
 and that, accomplish, will direct the way. 
pity her restless care, and weary strife,
 and point some issue to escape life;
 which so dismiss, no pen or human speech
 the ineffable recess can ever teach:
 the expanse, the light, the harmony, the throng,
 the bride attendance, and the bridal song,
 the numerous mansion, and the immortal tree,
 no eye, unpurged by death, must ever see,
 or wave which through that wondrous city roll. 
rest then content, my too impatient soul;
 observe but here the easy precept give,
 then wait with cheerful hope, till heaven be know in heaven.
