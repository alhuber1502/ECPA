the revenge of America.

by the same.

when fierce pisarro legion fly
over ravage field of rich Peru,
strike with his bleed people woe,
old india awful genius rise.
he sit on Andes topmost stone,
and hear a thousand nation groan;
for grief his feathery crown he tear,
to see huge Plata foam with gore;
he break his arrow, stamp the ground,
to view his city smoke round.

what woe, he cry, have lust of gold
over my poor country wide roll;
plunderer proceed! my bowel tear,
but you shall meet destruction there;
from the deep-vaulted mine shall rise
the insatiate fiend, pale avarice!
who step shall tremble justice fly,
peace, order, law, and amity!
i see all europe child curse
with lucre universal thirst:
the rage that sweep my son away,
my baneful gold shall well repay.
