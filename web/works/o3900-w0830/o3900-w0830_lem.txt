i 

lord and god of heavenly power,
 they â€” yet oh! benign we,
 glorious king, let earth proclaim,
 worm attempt to chant thy name.

thou to laud in song divine
 angel and archangel join;
 we with they our voice raise,
 echo thy eternal praise:

iii.

holy, holy, holy lord,
 live by heaven and earth adore! 
full of thou, they ever cry
 glory be to god most high!
