Therefore with Angels, &c.

I.

LORD and GOD of Heav'nly Pow'rs,
 Theirs â€” yet Oh! benignly Ours,
 Glorious King, let Earth proclaim,
 Worms attempt to chant thy Name. 

II.

Thee to laud in Songs Divine
 Angels and Archangels join;
 We with Them our Voices raise,
 Echoing thy Eternal Praise:

III.

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord,
 Live by Heav'n and Earth ador'd! 
Full of Thee, they ever cry
 Glory be to GOD most High!
