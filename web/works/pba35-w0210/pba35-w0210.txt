To a Lady at Bath.

Flavia, since Conquest is your Aim,
 I'll point you out the Way;
 And give you an unerring Scheme
 For universal Sway. 

Since Nature gave a Form so fair,
 Why will you practise Art? 
Which serves too oft to shew the Snare,
 And warn the heedless Heart. 

Those Eyes could never fail to kill;
 But lose their Force by too much Skill. 
Learn then to captivate the Age,
 From beauteous, unaffected Page.
