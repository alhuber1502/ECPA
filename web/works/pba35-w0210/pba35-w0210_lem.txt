to a lady at bath.

Flavia, since conquest be your aim,
 i will point you out the way;
 and give you a unerring scheme
 for universal sway. 

since nature give a form so fair,
 why will you practise art? 
which serve too oft to show the snare,
 and warn the heedless heart. 

those eye can never fail to kill;
 but lose their force by too much skill. 
learn then to captivate the age,
 from beauteous, unaffected page.
