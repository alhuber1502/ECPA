to a certain author, on his write a prologue, wherein he describe a traveller freeze in a snow storm.

no more let poet vain boast
 their fine descriptive art,
 they ransack nature gay store,
 yet rare warm the heart. 

hail, happy bard, who brilliant wit,
 with more than poet art,
 can from a freeze mass extract
 fire that can melt the heart.
