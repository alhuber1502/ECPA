Cupid and Chloe.

by the same.

to deck her bosom Chloe choose,
before all flower, the blush rose:
it make her breast more lovely show,
and add whiteness to their snow.
the tender nymph, herself a bud,
so much already understand.

but once, bless hour! she go to see
the produce of the favourite tree.
a large and tempt rose she find,
which spread its perfume all around.
it seem to court the virgin hand,
the virgin do not long withstand.
she pluck — but o! a sudden pain
make she release the stalk again.
the wound appear, her finger bleed,
and stain the rose with guilty red.
the nymph, with pain and anger move,
begin to hate what once she love;
she sigh, she weep, and stamp, and swear
she will touch the odious tree no more.

when forth a little Cupid come,
the appease the cry angry dame.
the angry nymph the god perceive
struggle through the intangle leaf:
when from his fragrant ambuscade
he thus accost the weep maid.

cease, Chloe, cease; and do not cry,
nor blame the harmless tree — it be i.
it be i, that cause the little pain,
and i — will make it well again.
my mother bid i do it; and say,
this herb will ease the suffering maid.
let it but to the place be bind,
it will stop the blood, and heal the wound.
but, Chloe, if so small a dart,
and in the finger, give such smart,
what, madam — if i will pierce your heart?
cease then to scorn my power; and know,
by what i have do, what i can do.

here he assume a awful look;
he nod thrice, his lock he shake,
and mimic Jove in all he speak.
with strenuous arm he twang his bow,
he show she all his quiver too;
this, say the god, — and this, the dart,
that wound such and such a heart.

the virgin see, admire, believe,
and bow — the god with smile receive
the adoration which she pay,
and wave his purple wing, and leave the wonder maid.

my Chloe still can show the scar,
and boast the God peculiar care.
she love and be belove again,
secure of pleasure, free from pain.
i have see the rose adorn with blood,
which from my Chloe finger flow;
i have see the sprig where Cupid stand.
i see his little fragrant nest —
and Chloe tell i all the rest.
