fairy tale in the ancient english style. 

in britain isle and Arthur day,
 when midnight fairy dance the maze,
 live Edwin of the green;
 Edwin, i wis, a gentle youth,
 endow with courage, sense and truth,
 though bad shape he be. 

his mountain back mote well be say
 to measure heighth against his head,
 and lift it self above:
 yet spite of all that nature do
 to make his uncouth form forbid,
 this creature dare to love. 

he feel the charm of edith eye,
 nor want hope to gain the prize,
 can lady look within;
 but one sir topaz dress with art,
 and, if a shape can win a heart,
 he have a shape to win. 

Edwin (if right i read my song)
 with slight passion pace along
 all in the Moony light:
 it be near a old enchant court,
 where sportive fairy make resort
 to revel out the night. 

his heart be drear, his hope be cross,
 it be late, it be far, the path be lose
 that reach the neighbour-town;
 with weary step he quit the shade,
 resolve the darkling dome he tread,
 and drop his limb down. 

but scant he lay he on the floor,
 when hollow wind remove the door,
 a tremble rock the ground:
 and (well i ween to count aright)
 at once a hundred taper light
 on all the wall around. 

now sound tongue assail his ear,
 now sound foot approachen near,
 and now the sound increase:
 and from the corner where he lie
 he see a train profuse gay
 come pranckle over the place. 

but (trust i gentle!) never yet
 be dight a masque half so neat,
 or half so rich before;
 the country lend the sweet perfume,
 the sea the pearl, the sky the plume,
 the town its silken store. 

now while he gaze, a gallant dress
 in flaunt robe above the rest,
 with awful accent cry;
 what mortal of a wretched mind,
 who sigh insect the balmy wind,
 have here presume to hide? 

at this the Swain who venturous soul
 no fear of magic art controul,
 advance in open sight;
 'nor have i cause of dread, he say,
' who view by no presumption lead
 'your revel of the night. 

it be grief, for scorn of faithful love,
 'which make my step unweeting, rove
' amid the nightly dew. 
it be well, the gallant cry again,
 we fairy never injure man
 who dare to tell we true. 

exalt thy love-dejected heart,
 be mine the task, or ever we part,
 to make thou grief resign;
 now take the pleasure of thy chance;
 while i with MAB my partner dance,
 be little Mable thy. 

he speak, and all a sudden there
 light music float in wanton air;
 the monarch lead the queen:
 the rest their fairy partner find,
 and Mable trim trip the ground
 with Edwin of the green. 

the dance past, the board be lay,
 and siker such a feast be make
 as heart and lip desire;
 without hand the dish fly,
 the glass with a wish come nigh,
 and with a wish retire. 

but now to please the fairy king,
 full every deal they laugh and sing,
 and antic feat devise;
 some wind and tumble like a ape,
 and othersome transmute their shape
 in edwin wonder eye. 

till one at last that robin hight,
 (renown for pinch maid by night)
 have hent he up aloof;
 and full against the beam he fling,
 where by the back the youth he hang
 to spraul uneath the roof. 

from thence, "reverse my charm, he cry,
" and let it fair now suffice
 "the gambol have be show. 
but Oberon answer with a smile,
 content thou Edwin for a while,
 the vantage be thy own. 

here end all the phantom-play;
 they smell the fresh approach of day,
 and hear a cock to crow;
 the whirl wind that bear the crowd
 have clape the door, and whistle loud,
 to warn they all to go. 

then scream all at once they fly,
 and all at once the taper dy;
 poor Edwin fall to floor;
 forlorn his state, and dark the place,
 be never wight in sike a case
 through all the land before. 

but soon as than Apollo rise,
 full jolly creature home he go,
 he feel his back the less;
 his honest tongue and steady mind
 have rid he of the lump behind
 which make he want success. 

with lusty livelyhed he talk,
 he seem a dance as he walk,
 his story soon take wind;
 and beauteous Edith see the youth,
 endow with courage, sense and truth,
 without a bunch behind. 

the story tell, sir topaz move,
 (the youth of Edith erst approve)
 to see the revel scene:
 at close of eve he leave his home,
 and wend to find the ruin dome
 all on the gloomy plain. 

as there he bide, it so befall,
 the wind come rustle down a dell,
 a shake seize the wall:
 up spring the taper as before,
 the fairy brag foot the floor,
 and music fill the hall. 

but certes sore sink with woe
 sir topaz see the Elphin show,
 his spirit in he dy:
 when Oberon cry, 'a man be near,
' a mortal passion, clepe fear,
 'hang flag in the sky. 

with that sir topaz (hapless youth!) 
in accent falter ay for Ruth
 intreat they pity grant;
 for also he be a mister wight
 betray by wander in the night
 to tread the circle haunt;

 'ah losell vile, at once they roar! 
' and little skill of fairy lore,
 'thy cause to come we know:
' now have thy kestrel courage fall;
 'and fairy, since a lie you tell,
' be free to work thou woe. 

then will, who bear the wispy fire
 to trail the swain among the mire,
 the caitiff upward fling;
 there like a tortoise in a shop
 he dangle from the chamber-top,
 where whilom Edwin hang. 

the revel now proceed apace,
 deff they frisk it over the place,
 they sit, they drink, and eat;
 the time with frolick mirth beguile,
 and poor sir topaz hang the while
 until all the rout retreat. 

by this the Starrs begin to wink,
 they skriek, they fly, the taper sink,
 and down ydrop the knight. 
for never spell by fairy lay
 with strong enchantment bind a glade
 beyond the length of night. 

Chill, dark, alone, adreed, he lie,
 till up the welkin rise the day,
 then deem the Dole be over:
 but wot you well his hard lot? 
his silly back the bunch have get
 which Edwin lose afore. 

this tale a sybil-nurse aread;
 she soft stroke my youngling head,
 and when the tale be do,
 'thus some be bear, my son (she cry)
' with base impediment to rise,
 'and some be bear with none. 

 'but virtue can it self advance
' to what the favourite fool of chance
' by fortune seem design;
 'virtue can gain the odds of fate,
' and from it self shake off the weight
 'upon the unworthy mind.
