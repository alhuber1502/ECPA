to death.

o king of terror, who unbounded sway
 all that have life, must certain obey
 the king, the priest, the prophet, all be thy,
 nor will even god (in flesh) thy stroke decline. 
my name be on thy roll, and sure i must
 encrease thy gloomy kingdom in the dust. 
my soul at this no apprehension feel,
 but tremble at thy sword, thy rack, thy wheel
 thy scorch fever, which distract the sense
 and snatch we rave, unprepared from hence;
 at thy contagious dart, that wind the head
 of weep friend, who wait at die bed. 
spare these, and let thy time be when it will;
 my business be to die, and thy to kill. 
gentle thy fatal sceptre on i lay,
 and take to thy cold arm, insensible, thy prey.
