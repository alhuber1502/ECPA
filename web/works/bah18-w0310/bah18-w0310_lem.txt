the genius of the mountain of balagata,

in the east Indies, bewail the misery buy upon his country.

his song.

from balagata wavy brow
 the genius cast his eye below,
 survey with grief the hostile plain,
 and thus to heaven address his strain. 

here first arise, in early time,
 the beam of wisdom light sublime;
 from hence the stream of science flow,
 though now its source be lose in blood. 

o, brama, where be now thy place? 
and why on thy desert race
 fall more than thy weak slave can bear? 
behold they victim to despair! 

behold thy son unpitied bleed,
 while wealth and honour crown the deed:
 see grasp avarice deny
 a moment to their suppliant cry. 

dark deadly fraud, wild horrid strife,
 the poison bowl, the murder knife,
 combine thy people to annoy;
 rise and avenge they, or destroy! 

with chain of fire the genii bind,
 who come the scourge of human kind;
 plunge they in sea of melt over,
 crown they with poniard dip in gore. 

o, brama! may thy slave prevail,
 soon shall they spread their part sail;
 command they distant far to fly,
 fall demon of calamity!
