[Invitation to Mason]

Prim Hurd attends your call and Palgrave proud,
Stonhewer the lewd and Delaval the loud.
For thee does Powell squeeze and Marriott sputter,
And Glynn cut phizzes and Tom Nevile stutter.
Brown sees thee sitting on his nose's tip,
The Widow feels thee in her aching hip,
For thee fat Nanny sighs and handy Nelly,
And Balguy with a bishop in his belly!
