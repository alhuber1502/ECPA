[invitation to Mason]

prim Hurd attend your call and Palgrave proud,
stonhewer the lewd and Delaval the loud.
for thou do Powell squeeze and Marriott sputter,
and Glynn cut phizze and Tom nevile stutter.
brown see thou sit on his nose tip,
the widow feel thou in her ache hip,
for thou fat nanny sigh and handy Nelly,
and balguy with a bishop in his belly!
