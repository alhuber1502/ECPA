on a unlooked-for separation from a friend. 

transient prove our sweet pleasure,
 short our moment of delight;
 while we grasp the darling treasure,
 o how rapid be its flight? 

oft at morn ourselves we flatter,
 that our comfort will decay:
 fortune lavish seem to scatter
 fair flower along our way. 

but the change by night be gall;
 we lament our doom severe:
 joy, like snow on Ailsa fall,
 in a moment disappear. 

such the plague of human nature,
 fond to trifle with our smart,
 while we do escape the great,
 little evil rend our heart. 

i have lose no value charter,
 nor lament a fickle swain;
 but, alas! a friend departure,
 fill my heart with pierce pain. 

ponder sharpen every arrow,
 sigh but augment my grief:
 now i mourn, overwhelm with sorrow,
 but next hour may bring relief.
