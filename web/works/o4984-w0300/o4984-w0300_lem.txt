a epistle to a friend in town.

by mr. Dyer.

have my friend in the town, in the gay busy town,
 forget such a man as John Dyer? 
or heedless despise they, or pity the clown
 who bosom no pageantry fire? 

no matter, no matter — content in the shade —
 (content? — why, every thing charm i)
 fall in tune all down the green steep, you cascade,
 till hence rigid virtue alarm i. 

till outrage arise, or misery need
 the swift, the intrepid avenger;
 till sacred religion, or liberty bleed,
 then mine be the deed, and the danger. 

alas! what a folly, that wealth and domain
 we heap up in sin and in sorrow! 
immense be the toil, yet the labour how vain! 
be not life to be over tomorrow? 

then glide on my moment, the few that i have,
 smooth-shaded, and quiet and even;
 while gentle the body descend to the grave,
 and the spirit arise to heaven.
