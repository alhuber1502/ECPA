upon a alcove, now at parson green.

o favourite Muse of Shenstone hear!
and leave awhile his blissful grove;
aid i this sweet alcove to sing,
the author seat who Shenstone love.

here the soul-harr'wing genius form
his pamela enchant story!
and here divine CLARISSA die
a martyr to our sex glory!

it be here the noble-minded howe
with every generous passion glow:
and here the gentle belford eye
with manly sorrow overflow.

here Clementina, hapless maid!
with wild distress each bosom tear:
and here the lovely Harriet own
a virgin hope, a virgin fear.

here Emily, sweet artless girl,
fill every breast with strange delight!
and when we fear she early fall,
secure her conquest by her flight.

here sprightly Charlotte humorous wit
dispense mirth to all around:
but, ah! we tremble, while we smile,
lest its fine edge herself shall wound.

here Grandison, to crown the whole,
a bright exemplar stand confess!
who steal those virtue we admire
from the great author glow breast.

o sacred seat! be thou revere
by such as own thy master power;
and, like his work, for age last,
till fame and language be no more.
