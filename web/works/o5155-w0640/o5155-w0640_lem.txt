book i. ode xviii. invitation to his mistress.

oft Faunus leave arcadia plain,
and to the Sabine hill retreat:
he guard my flock from rush rain,
from pierce wind, and scorch heat.

where lurk the thyme, or shrub appear,
my wanton kid secure play;
my goat no poisonous serpent fear,
safe wander through the woodland way.

no hostile wolf the fold invade;
ustica's pendent rock rebound
my song; and all the sylvan shade,
by echo teach, return the sound.

the god my verse propitious hear,
my head from every danger shield:
for you, overflow the bounteous year,
and plenty horn have heap my field.

responsive to the teian string,
within the sun-defended vale,
here, soft warble you shall sing
each tender, tuneful, amorous tale.

no rival, here, shall burst the band
that wreathe my charmer beauteous hair,
nor seize she weak struggle hand;
but love and Horace guard the fair.
