SONNET.

TO MATTHEW BARNARD.

BY THE SAME.

MATTHEW, whose skilful hand and well-worn spade
 Shall soon be call'd to make the humble bed,
 Where I at last shall rest my weary head,
 And form'd of dust again in dust be laid;

Near, but not in the Church of God, be made
 My clay-cold cell, and near the common tread
 Of passing friends; when number'd with the dead,
 We're equall all, and vain distinctions fade:

The cowslip, violet, or the pale primrose
 Perhaps may chance to deck the verdant sweard;
 Which twisted briar or hasle-bands entwine;
 Symbols of life's soon-fading glories those â€”
 Do thou the monumental hillock guard
 From trampling cattle, and the routing swine.
