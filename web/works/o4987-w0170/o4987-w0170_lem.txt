sonnet.

to MATTHEW Barnard.

by the same.

MATTHEW, who skilful hand and well-worn spade
 shall soon be call to make the humble bed,
 where i at last shall rest my weary head,
 and form of dust again in dust be lay;

near, but not in the church of god, be make
 my clay-cold cell, and near the common tread
 of pass friend; when number with the dead,
 we be equal all, and vain distinction fade:

the cowslip, violet, or the pale primrose
 perhaps may chance to deck the verdant sword;
 which twist briar or hasle-band entwine;
 symbol of life soon-fading glory those â€”
 do thou the monumental hillock guard
 from trample cattle, and the rout swine.
