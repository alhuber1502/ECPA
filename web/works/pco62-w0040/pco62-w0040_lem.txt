the happy husband, and the old Batchelor.

a dialogue.

a country gentleman of late,
 of honest fame and good estate,
 who with a sober virtuous wife,
 for many year have lead his life;
 walk in the field to take the air,
 and chance to meet his neighbour there,
 a gentleman of good degree,
 polite, and gay, of humour free;
 who long have be to love incline,
 but never can fix his waver mind,
 and be meet at his desire,
 they to his neighbour house retire;
 a rural seat, which for long space
 have go in the paternal race,
 there in the hall they both regale
 with generous wine and nappy ale,
 until the evening be come,
 the guest talk of return home. 

husband.

my dear wife will think, say he,
 that some mishap have fall on i. 

Batchelor.

his friend reply, with scornful air,
 i thank my star I have no such care;
 long, as i please, abroad i stay,
 and seldom ask what time of day:
 i game and quaff away the night,
 and reel to bed at morning light;
 thus i pursue my pleasure free,
 and have no wife to rail at i:
 such fatal curb i can bear,
 and therefore take a prudent care,
 to shun the matrimonial snare. 

husband.

his friend reply with cheerful voice
 i never do repent my choice,
 i will not have the golden chain,
 of HYMEN be unlink again. 
nor will i leave my dear wife,
 to gain the great good of life:
 long as i please abroad i bide,
 and do not fear my wife will chide,
 for she be so oblige, i
 take pleasure in her company:
 her kind advice she do impart,
 and by her prudence gain my heart;
 while you abroad unsettled roam
 for want of such a spouse at home;
 it be a unhappy life you lead,
 no faithful friend in time of need:
 thus, shall you die, you will leave no son,
 to take your place when you be go. 

Batchelor.

that be more, my friend, than you do know
 i may have son and daughter too,
 without the trouble of a wife
 i can enjoy the sweet of life,
 to marry i shall make no haste,
 variety do please my taste,
 your counsel do not please my mind,
 because i hate to be confine. 

husband.

it may indeed, my friend, be so,
 you may have son and daughter too,
 but if you have, you must be blame,
 and of your offspring be ashamed,
 while sober man their child prize,
 your progeny you basterdize,
 of such you have no cause to boast;
 your race extinct, and name quite lose;
 for while you thus with harlot rove
 you never know the sweet of love,
 nor taste those comfort that attend
 a virtuous wife, and faithful friend,
 when i with any cross meet
 i to my dear spouse retreat,
 who prudent counsel have the art
 to ease my care, and cheer my heart,
 she do all way and mean improve
 to rule the house in peace and love
 her mild command and gentle sway
 her servant will obey;
 thus by her prudent management,
 my life be a scene of true content. 

Batchelor.

indeed, my friend, if this be so,
 you be the happy man i know. 
for you enjoy i plain find,
 the phoenix of the female kind;
 sure there be but very few
 can just boast as now you do,
 if i can meet with such a wife,
 myself will choose a marry life. 

husband.

my friend, if i may speak my mind,
 as virtuous wife be hard to find,
 i think it equal as true,
 that love husband be so too
 i wish that man will know his place,
 as lord of the create race,
 vicegerent of this spacious ball,
 a shine light observe by all;
 wise in his conduct he will be,
 a pattern to his family,
 and by his own example lead
 his spouse the path wherein to tread:
 will he to she himself approve,
 and ever bear a constant love,
 i be persuade we shall find
 most woman virtuous, just and kind. 

in body natural, we see
 if once the head distemper be,
 the curious fabric feel the smart,
 and bear by sympathy a part;
 in body politic the same,
 then can we think our wife to blame,
 if they shall blind venture on
 those vicious way ourselves have go;
 but where strict virtue bear the sway,
 that virtue can lead astray. 
when mild reproof have little force
 to check a husband vicious course,
 a wife provoke, with rage and fear,
 may utter truth he hate to hear. 
but now before i make a end,
 let i advise you as a friend,
 to choose a consort that may be
 a blessing to your family. 
but let not wealth or grandeur move
 to wed with one you can love,
 no doubt but you a girl may find
 to bring you gold and please your mind;
 but if it otherwise shall prove
 set money by and wed for love,
 a pleasant, chaste, and comely dame,
 of good descent and honest fame;
 all other object banish quite
 and fix on she your whole delight;
 let word and action still commend
 yourself to be her faithful friend;
 then be assure you will not complain
 of want of due respect again. 

Batchelor.

my friend, shall i be rule by you,
 i to all joy must bid adieu
 and that which most of all do grieve,
 my old companion i must leave,
 those jovial spark i plain see
 offensive to a wife will be,
 and if they shall not, i confess
 my trouble will be never the less;
 for when they at my house appear
 i of my brow shall stand in fear;
 therefore i think i must go on
 to live as I have already do. 

husband.

if jealousy your mind possess,
 you will never be happy i confess,
 but sure with care you may prevent,
 the cause of such discontent,
 if you be constant in your love,
 your wife will hardly ever rove,
 and for your jovial company,
 whatever you have be let they see,
 to virtue rule your strict conformity. 
if they their wicked course hold,
 you friendship quick will grow cold,
 if they reform the case be clear,
 of they you need not stand in fear;
 and thus you may prevent all strife
 and lead a sweet content life. 

Batchelor.

my love friend, i plain see
 good counsel you have give i,
 and now my friend, i free own,
 my former course past and go,
 do for a moment please the mind,
 but leave a bitter sting behind;
 although my bloom of life be past,
 i hope i shall reform at last. 
but first my care shall be apply
 to choose a virtuous love bride,
 and so behave to she that we
 may live in love and unity,
 so may we find our joy increase,
 for virtue way be path of peace.
