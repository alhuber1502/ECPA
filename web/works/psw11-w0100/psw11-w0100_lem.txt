Apollo outwit.

to the honourable mrs. Finch, under her name of ardelia,

write, 1709. 

Phoebus now shorten every shade,
 up to the northern tropic come,
 and thence behold a lovely maid
 attend on a royal dame. 

the god lay down his feeble ray,
 then light from his glitter coach,
 but fence his head with his own bay
 before he dare the nymph approach. 

under those sacred leaf, secure
 from common lightning of the sky,
 he fond think he may endure
 the flash of ardeliah eye. 

the nymph who oft have read in book,
 of that bright god who bard invoke,
 soon know Apollo by his look,
 and guest his business ever he speak. 

he in the old celestial cant,
 confess his flame, and swear by Styx,
 what ever she will desire, to grant,
 but wise ardelia know his trick. 

Ovid have warn she to beware,
 of stroll God, who usual trade be,
 under pretence of take air,
 to pick up sublunary lady. 

however she give no flat denial,
 as have malice in her heart,
 and be resolve upon a trial,
 to cheat the god in his own art. 

hear my request the virgin say
 let which i please of all the nine
 attend when ever i want their aid,
 obey my call, and only mine. 

by vow oblige, by passion lead,
 the god can not refuse her prayer;
 he wave his wreathe thrice over her head,
 thrice mutter something to the air. 

and now he think to seize his due,
 but she the charm already try,
 Thalia hear the call
 to wait at bright ardelia side. 

on sight of this celestial prude,
 Apollo think it vain to stay,
 nor in her presence dare be rude,
 but make his leg and go away. 

he hope to find some lucky hour,
 when on their queen the muse wait;
 but Pallas own ardelia power,
 for vow divine be keep by fate. 

then full of range Apollo speak,
 deceitful nymph i see thy art,
 and though i can my gift revoke,
 i will disappoint its noble part. 

let stubborn pride possess thou long,
 and be thou negligent of fame,
 with every muse to grace thy song,
 may thou despise a poet name. 

of modest poet thou be first,
 to silent shade repeat thy verse,
 till fame and echo almost burst,
 yet hardly dare one line rehearse. 

and last, my vengeance to complete,
 may you descend to take renown,
 prevail on by the thing you hate,
 a â€” and one that wear a gown.
