write extempore on the picture of a friend.

i

within this narrow compass be confine,
a form possess of every please grace,
the matchless beauty of who heavenly mind,
can never be paint in so small a space.

ii

let every praise so much the artist due,
with never-ceasing honour on he fall,
yet when this bright similitude i view,
i mourn the loss of the original.

iii

to fames exalt summit be thou raise,
and move sublime in a distinguish sphere,
where wonder mortal shall behold amaze,
those last honour which the just revere.

iv

above the malice of the artful mind,
above the envious, ignorant, and vain,
above the reach of slanderous mankind,
who great pleasure be another pain.

v

thou chief wonder that adorn the age,
still, still, the path of fame and truth pursue,
thy name shall celebrate some future page,
some yet unheard of muse shall sing of you.
