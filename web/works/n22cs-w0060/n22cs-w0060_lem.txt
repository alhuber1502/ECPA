sonnet [06] vi. to hope. 

oh, hope! thou sooth sweet of human woe! 
how shall i lure thou to my haunt forlorn! 
for i will thou renew the wither rose,
 and clear my painful path of point thorn? 
ah come, sweet nymph! in smile and softness dress,
 like the young hour that lead the tender year;
 enchantress come! and charm my care to rest: —
 alas! the flatterer fly, and will not hear! 
a prey to fear, anxiety and pain,
 must i a sad existence still deplore? 
lo! — the flower fade, but all the thorn remain,
 'for i the vernal garland bloom no more.'
come then 'pale misery love!' be thou my cure,
 and i will bless thou, who though slow art sure.
