to miss â€”, on her play upon the harpsicord in a room hang with some flower-piece of her own painting.

by the same.

when Stella strike the tuneful string
 in scene of imitate spring,
 where beauty lavish her power,
 on bed of never-fading flower,
 and pleasure propagate around
 each charm of modulate sound,
 ah! think not, in the dangerous hour,
 the nymph fictitious, as the flower;
 but shun, rash youth, the gay alcove,
 nor tempt the snare of wily love

when charm thus press on every sense,
 what think of flight, or of defence? 
deceitful hope, and vain desire,
 for ever flutter over her lyre,
 delight, as the youth draw nigh,
 to point the glance of her eye,
 and form, with unerring art,
 new chain to hold the captive heart. 

but on these region of delight,
 may truth intrude with dare flight,
 can Stella, sprightly, fair, and young,
 one moment hear the moral song,
 instruction with her flower may spring,
 and wisdom warble from her string. 

Mark, when from thousand mingle dye,
 thou see one please form arise,
 how active light, and thoughtful shade,
 in great scene each other aid;
 mark, when the different note agree
 in friendly contrariety,
 how passion well-accorded strife,
 give all the harmony of life,
 thy picture shall thy conduct frame,
 consistent still, though not the same,
 thy music teach the noble art
 to tune the regulate heart.
