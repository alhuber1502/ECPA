To the Right Honourable the EARL of CHESTERFIELD, on his being installed Knight of the GARTER.

By the Same.

THese trophies, STANHOPE, of the lovely dame,
Once the bright object of a monarch's flame,
Who with such just propriety can wear,
As thou, the darling of the gay and fair?
See ev'ry friend to wit, politeness, love,
With one consent thy sovereign's choice approve!
And liv'd PLANTAGENET her voice to join,
Herself, and GARTER, both were surely thine.
