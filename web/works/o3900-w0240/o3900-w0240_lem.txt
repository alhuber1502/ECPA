grace before meat.

i 

fountain of be, source of good! 
at who almighty breath
 the creature prove our bane or food,
 dispense life or death:

ii.

thou we address with humble fear,
 vouchsafe thy gift to crown;
 father of all, thy child hear,
 and send a bless down. 

iii.

o may our soul for ever pine
 thy grace to taste and see;
 athirst for righteousness divine,
 and hungry after thou! 

iv.

for this we lift our longing eye,
 we wait the gracious word;
 speak â€” and our heart from earth shall rise,
 and feed upon the lord.
