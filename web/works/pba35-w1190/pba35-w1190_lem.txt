verse tie about a fawn neck, which be present to a very young lady, call by her friend the ivory maid.

by the same. 

as through this sylvan scene i stray,
 i see and love the ivory maid:
 and hear that she flee from man,
 i beg this form of mighty Pan;
 to try, by every win art,
 to gain possession of her heart;
 when rage tempest cloud the sky,
 transport at her foot to lie;
 when Phoebus brighten up the weather,
 to trip it over the lawn together.
