Verses ty'd about a Fawn's Neck, which was presented to a very young Lady, call'd by her Friends the Ivory Maid.

By the Same. 

As thro' this sylvan Scene I stray'd,
 I saw and lov'd the Iv'ry Maid:
 And hearing that she fled from Man,
 I begg'd this Form of mighty Pan;
 To try, by ev'ry winning Art,
 To gain Possession of her Heart;
 When raging Tempests cloud the Sky,
 Transported at her Feet to lie;
 When Phoebus brightens up the Weather,
 To trip it o'er the Lawns together.
