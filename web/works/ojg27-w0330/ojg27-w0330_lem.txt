fable [32] xxxii.

the two owl and the sparrow.

two formal owl together sit,
 confer thus in solemn chat. 

how be the modern taste decay! 
where be the respect to wisdom pay? 
our worth the grecian sage know,
 they give our sire the honour due,
 they weigh the dignity of fowl,
 and pry into the depth of owl. 
Athens, the seat of learned fame,
 with general voice revere our name;
 on merit title be confer,
 and all adore the athenian bird. 

brother, you reason well, reply
 the solemn mate, with half-shut eye;
 right. Athens be the seat of learning,
 and true wisdom be discern. 
beside, on Pallas' helm we sit,
 the type and ornament of wit:
 but now, alas, we be quite neglect,
 and a pert sparrow more respect. 

a sparrow, who be lodge beside,
 o'erhear they sooth each other pride,
 and thus he nimble vent his heat. 

who meet a fool must find conceit. 
i grant, you be at Athens grace,
 and on minerva helm be place,
 but every bird that wing the sky,
 except a owl, can tell you why. 
from hence they teach their school to know
 how false we judge by outward show,
 that we shall never look esteem,
 since fool as wise as you may seem. 
will you contempt and scorn avoid,
 let your vain-glory be destroy;
 humble your arrogance of thought,
 pursue the way by nature teach,
 so shall you find delicious fare,
 and grateful farmer praise your care,
 so shall sleek mouse your chase reward,
 and no keen cat find more regard.
