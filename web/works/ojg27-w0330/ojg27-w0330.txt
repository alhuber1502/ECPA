FABLE [32] XXXII.

The two Owls and the Sparrow.

Two formal Owls together sate,
 Conferring thus in solemn chat. 

How is the modern taste decay'd! 
Where's the respect to wisdom paid? 
Our worth the Grecian sages knew,
 They gave our sires the honour due,
 They weigh'd the dignity of fowls,
 And pry'd into the depth of owls. 
Athens, the seat of learned fame,
 With gen'ral voice rever'd our name;
 On merit title was conferr'd,
 And all ador'd th' Athenian bird. 

Brother, you reason well, replies
 The solemn mate, with half-shut eyes;
 Right. Athens was the seat of learning,
 And truly wisdom is discerning. 
Besides, on Pallas' helm we sit,
 The type and ornament of wit:
 But now, alas, we're quite neglected,
 And a pert sparrow's more respected. 

A Sparrow, who was lodg'd beside,
 O'erhears them sooth each other's pride,
 And thus he nimbly vents his heat. 

Who meets a fool must find conceit. 
I grant, you were at Athens grac'd,
 And on Minerva's helm were plac'd,
 But ev'ry bird that wings the sky,
 Except an owl, can tell you why. 
From hence they taught their schools to know
 How false we judge by outward show,
 That we should never looks esteem,
 Since fools as wise as you might seem. 
Would ye contempt and scorn avoid,
 Let your vain-glory be destroy'd;
 Humble your arrogance of thought,
 Pursue the ways by nature taught,
 So shall ye find delicious fare,
 And grateful farmers praise your care,
 So shall sleek mice your chase reward,
 And no keen cat find more regard.
