to wisdom.

o wisdom! if thy soft controul
 can sooth the sickness of the soul,
 can bid the war passion cease,
 and breathe the balm of tender peace,
 wisdom! i bless thy gentle sway,
 and ever, ever will obey. 

but if thou come with frown austere
 to nurse the brood of care and fear;
 to bid our sweet passion die,
 and leave we in their room a sigh;
 or if thy aspect stern have power
 to wither each poor transient flower,
 that cheer the pilgrimage of woe,
 and dry the spring whence hope shall flow;
 wisdom, thy empire i disclaim,
 thou empty boast of pompous name! 
in gloomy shade of cloister dwell,
 but never haunt my cheerful cell. 
hail to pleasure frolic train;
 hail to fancy golden reign;
 festive mirth, and laughter wild,
 free and sportful as the child;
 hope with eager sparkle eye,
 and easy faith, and fond surprise:
 let these, in fairy colour dress,
 forever share my careless breast;
 then, though wise i may not be,
 the wise themselves shall envy i.
