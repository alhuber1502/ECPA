HYMN to CHRIST the King.

I.

JESU, my GOD and King,
 Thy Regal State I sing. 
Thou, and only Thou art great,
 High thine Everlasting Throne;
 Thou the Sov'reign Potentate,
 Blest, Immortal Thou alone. 

II.

Essay your choicest Strains,
 The King Messiah reigns! 
Tune your Harps, Celestial Quire,
 Joyful all, your Voices raise,
 CHRIST than earth-born Monarchs higher,
 Sons of Men and Angels praise. 

III.

Hail your dread Lord and Ours,
 Dominions, Thrones, and Pow'rs! 
Source of Pow'r He rules alone:
 Veil your Eyes, and prostrate fall,
 Cast your Crowns before his Throne,
 Hail the Cause, the Lord of all! 

IV.

Let Earth's remotest Bound
 With echoing Joys resound;
 CHRIST to praise let all conspire:
 Praise doth all to CHRIST belong;
 Shout ye first-born Sons of Fire,
 Earth repeat the Glorious Song. 

V.

Worthy, O LORD, art Thou
 That ev'ry Knee should bow,
 Every Tongue to Thee confess,
 Universal Nature join
 Strong and Mighty Thee to bless,
 Gracious, Merciful, Benign! 

VI.

Wisdom is due to Thee,
 And Might and Majesty:
 Thee in Mercy rich we prove;
 Glory, Honour, Praise receive,
 Worthy Thou of all our Love,
 More than all we pant to give. 

VII.

Justice and Truth maintain
 Thy everlasting Reign. 
One with thine Almighty Sire,
 Partner of an Equal Throne,
 King of Hearts, let all conspire,
 Gratefully thy Sway to own. 

VIII.

Prince of the Hosts of GOD
 Display thy Pow'r abroad:
 Strong and high is thy Right-hand,
 Terrible in Majesty! 
Who can in thine Anger stand? 
Who the vengeful Bolt can flee? 

IX.

Thee when the Dragon's Pride
 To Battle vain defy'd,
 Brighter than the Morning-star
 Lucifer, as Lightning fell,
 Far from Heav'n, from Glory far
 Headlong hurl'd to deepest Hell. 

X.

Sin felt of old thy Pow'r,
 Thou Patient Conqueror! 
Long he vex'd the World below,
 Long they groan'd beneath his Reign;
 Thou destroy'dst the Tyrant Foe,
 Thou redeem'dst the Captive, Man. 

XI.

Trembles the King of Fears
 Whene'er thy Cross appears. 
Once its dreaded Force he found:
 Saviour, cleave again the Sky;
 Slain by an Eternal Wound
 Death shall then for ever die!
