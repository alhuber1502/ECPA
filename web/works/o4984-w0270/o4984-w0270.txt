VERSES WRITTEN ORIGINALLY IN THE PERSIC LANGUAGE.

BY THE SAME.

IF mortal hands thy peace destroy,
 Or friendship's gifts bestow,
 Wilt thou to Man ascribe thy joy? 
To Man impute thy woe? 

'Tis God, whose thoughts to various ends
 The human lot dispose,
 Around thee plant assisting friends,
 Or heap avenging Foes. 

Not from the Bow the deaths proceed,
 But from the Archer's skill;
 Who lends the thirsty shaft its speed,
 And gives it strength to kill.
