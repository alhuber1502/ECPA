by the same.

if mortal hand thy peace destroy,
 or friendship gift bestow,
 will thou to man ascribe thy joy? 
to man impute thy woe?

 the human lot dispose,
 around thou plant assist friend,
 or heap avenge foe. 

not from the bow the death proceed,
 but from the archer skill;
 who lend the thirsty shaft its speed,
 and give it strength to kill.
