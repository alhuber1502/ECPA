A LOVER's ANGER.

As Cloe came into the Room t'other Day,
 I peevish began; Where so long cou'd You stay? 
In your Life-time You never regarded your Hour:
 You promis'd at Two; and (pray look Child) 'tis Four. 
A Lady's Watch needs neither Figures nor Wheels:
 'Tis enough, that 'tis loaded with Baubles and Seals. 
A Temper so heedless no Mortal can bear —
 Thus far I went on with a resolute Air. 
Lord bless Me! said She; let a Body but speak:
 Here's an ugly hard Rose-Bud fall'n into my Neck:
 It has hurt Me, and vext Me to such a Degree —
 See here; for You never believe Me; pray see,
 On the left Side my Breast what a Mark it has made. 
So saying, her Bosom She careless display'd. 
That Seat of Delight I with Wonder survey'd;
 And forgot ev'ry Word I design'd to have said.
