from Philander to Eumenes. 

with pleasure i your welcome letter read,
 while Cupid for a little from i flee. 
with freedom write, dispel your trivial fear;
 there be nought presumptuous in your song appear;
 though strange the idea which you now convey,
 while you our lovely female thus portray. 

no doubt, there be, in the promiscuous crowd,
 the worthless fair, the virtuous and the good;
 the haughty nymph, the maid of humble mind;
 the imperious, yea, the gentle and the kind;
 such as a adamantine heart can charm,
 and furious tiger of their rage disarm. 
in all vicissitude of human life,
 man great blessing be a virtuous wife:
 her smile can fail to sooth his anxious breast,
 diffuse joy, while various care molest:
 her prudent counsel swift relief can bring,
 as abigail appease isr'el king. 

nor need i thus the sacred annal trace,
 in britain isle they claim the high place;
 when dire oppression, with uplift hand,
 his yoke extend over our native land,
 our sire to abject slavery be doom,
 our mother all their ancient claim resume:
 you will say my speech do i partial prove,
 and so ascribe the cruel cause to love. 
be you alone exempt from such a guest? 
be you of every antidote possess
 the effect a cure, or mitigate the pain? 
then may the archer cast his shaft in vain. 

of late dear friend i do such valour boast;
 but by one fatal glance the field be lose. 
while you be free of danger, still beware;
 be warn by i, and shun the allure snare. 
it be by some deem cowardice to fly,
 but sure it more ignoble be to die:
 to die, i be frantic, sir; what do i say? 
reason once more resume thy wonted sway;
 kind heaven defend we from such dire alarm;
 who will a victim fall to female charm? 
i find i be better while your line i read,
 i be almost from my Gallic fetter free. 
as you alone be partner of my grief,
 pray now congratulate my quick relief. 
i will not by prolixity offend;
 both bind and free, Philander be your friend.
