on the author birthday

thus lowly bend on my parent earth,
 i view with tear the day that give i birth;
 since i have power to think i never can find
 myself of any service to mankind;
 though oft this vain, this giddy foolish heart,
 for other grief do most severe smart;
 and yet i never find mean, or never can,
 but this i know, i never do they good. 
i who the iron hand of fate do press,
 though most familiar, never feel the less;
 scorn by those friend with who i once can vie,
 without one kind companion doom to sigh,
 i feel new cause, each succeed morn,
 to mourn the day when such a wretch be bear. 
but o! almighty father! if i dare
 to leave my eye to thou, accept this prayer;
 let never ambition fire my youthful breast,
 nor earthly trifle rob my soul of rest. 
may i never heave a sigh for dirty pelf,
 or any thing that but concern myself,
 unless my sin: o! may they be forgive,
 and all my happiness be place in heaven! 
o may i be enable to relieve
 the want, and sooth the care of those that grieve;
 i will view my birthday with a heart elate,
 and leave the world without the least regret.
