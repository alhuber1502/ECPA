grongar hill.

by mr. Dyer.

silent nymph, with curious eye!
who, the purple evening lie,
on the mountain lonely van,
beyond the noise of busy man,
paint fair the form of thing,
while the yellow linet sing;
or the tuneful nightingale
charm the forest with her tale;
come with all thy various hue,
come, and aid thy sister Muse;
now while Phoebus ride high
give lustre to the land and sky!
grongar hill invite my song,
draw the landskip bright and strong;
grongar, in who mossy cell
sweet muse quiet dwell;
grongar, in who silent shade,
for the modest muse make,
so oft i have, the evening still,
at the fountain of a rill,
sit upon a flowery bed,
with my hand beneath my head;
while stray my eye over towy flood,
over mead, and over wood,
from house to house, from hill to hill,
until contemplation have she fill.

about his chequer side i wind,
and leave his brook and mead behind,
and grove and grotto where i lie,
and vistoe shoot beam of day:
wide and wide spread the vale;
as circle on a smooth canal;
the mountain round, unhappy fate!
soon or late, all of height,
withdraw their summit from the sky,
and lessen as the other rise;
still the prospect wide spread,
add a thousand wood and mead,
still it widen, widen still,
and sink the newly-risen hill.

now, i gain the mountain brow,
what a landskip lie below!
no cloud, no vapour intervene,
but the gay, the open scene
do the face of nature show,
in all the hue of heaven bow!
and, swell to embrace the light,
spread around beneath the sight.

old castle on the cliff arise,
proud tower in the sky!
rush from the wood, the spire
seem from hence ascend fire!
half he beam Apollo shed
on the yellow mountain-head!
gild the fleece of the flock:
and glitter on the break rock!
below i tree unnumbered rise,
beautiful in various dye:
the gloomy pine, the poplar blue,
the yellow beech, the sable yew,
the slender fir, that taper grow,
the sturdy oak with broadspread bough.
and beyond the purple grove,
haunt of Phillis, queen of love!
gaudy as the open dawn,
lie a long and level lawn,
on which a dark hill, steep and high,
hold and charm the wander eye!
deep be his foot in towy flood,
his side be clothe with wave wood,
and ancient tower crown his brow,
that cast a awful look below;
who ragged wall the ivy creep,
and with her arm from fall keep;
so both a safety from the wind
on mutual dependence find.

it be now the raven bleak abode;
it be now the apartment of the toad;
and there the fox secure feed;
and there the poisonous adder breed,
conceal in ruin, moss and weed;
while, ever and anon, there fall
huge heap of hoary moulder wall.
yet time have see, that lift the low,
and level lay the lofty brow,
have see this break pile complete,
big with the vanity of state;
but transient be the smile of fate!
a little rule, a little sway,
a sun beam in a winter day,
be all the proud and mighty have
between the cradle and the grave.

and see the river how they run,
through wood and mead, in shade and sun,
sometime swift, sometime slow,
wave succeed wave, they go
a various journey to the deep,
like human life to endless sleep!
thus be nature vesture wrought,
to instruct our wander thought;
thus she dress green and gay,
to disperse our care away.

ever charm, ever new,
when will the landskip tire the view!
the fountain fall, the river flow,
the woody valley, warm and low;
the windy summit, wild and high,
rough rush on the sky!
the pleasant seat, the ruin tower,
the naked rock, the shady bower;
the town and village, dome and farm,
each give each a double charm,
as pearl upon a ethiope arm.

see on the mountain southern side,
where the prospect open wide,
where the evening gild the tide;
how close and small the hedge lie!
what streak of meadow cross the eye!
a step methinks may pass the stream,
so little distant danger seem;
so we mistake the future face,
eye through hope delude glass;
as yond summit soft and fair,
clad in colour of the air,
which to those who journey near,
barren, brown, and rough appear;
still we tread the same coarse way,
the present still a cloudy day.

o may i with myself agree,
and never covet what i see:
content i with a humble shade,
my passion tame, my wish lay;
for while our wish wild roll,
we banish quiet from the soul:
it be thus the busy beat the air;
and miser gather wealth and care.

now, even now, my joy run high,
as on the mountain-turf i lie;
while the wanton zephyr sing,
and in the vale perfume his wing;
while the water murmur deep;
while the shepherd charm his sheep;
while the bird unbounded fly,
and with music fill the sky,
now, even now, my joy run high.

be full, you court, be great who will;
search for peace with all your skill:
open wide the lofty door,
seek she on the marble floor,
in vain you search, she be not there;
in vain you search the dome of care!
grass and flower quiet tread,
on the mead and mountain-head,
along with pleasure, close ally
ever by each other side:
and often, by the murmur rill,
hear the thrush, while all be still,
within the grove of grongar hill.
