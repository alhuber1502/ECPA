HYMN for WHITSUNDAY.

I.

GRANTED is the Saviour's Prayer,
 Sent the gracious Comforter;
 Promise of our parting LORD,
 JESUS to his Heav'n restor'd:

II.

CHRIST; who now gone up on high,
 Captive leads Captivity,
 While his Foes from Him receive
 Grace, that GOD with Man may live. 

III.

GOD, the everlasting GOD,
 Makes with Mortals his Abode,
 Whom the Heavens cannot contain,
 He vouchsafes to dwell in Man. 

IV.

Never will he thence depart,
 Inmate of an humble Heart;
 Carrying on his Work within,
 Striving till he cast out Sin. 

V.

There He helps our feeble Moans,
 Deepens our imperfect Groans;
 Intercedes in Silence there,
 Sighs th' Unutterable Prayer. 

VI.

Come, Divine and peaceful Guest,
 Enter our devoted Breast;
 HOLY GHOST, our Hearts inspire,
 Kindle there the Gospel-Fire. 

VII.

Crown the agonizing Strife,
 Principle, and LORD of Life;
 Life Divine in us renew,
 Thou the Gift and Giver too! 

VIII.

Now descend and shake the Earth,
 Wake us into Second Birth;
 Now thy quick'ning Influence give,
 Blow â€” and these dry Bones shall live! 

VIII.

Brood Thou o'er our Nature's Night,
 Darkness kindles into Light;
 Spread thy over-shadowing Wings,
 Order from Confusion springs. 

X.

Pain and Sin, and Sorrow cease,
 Thee we taste, and all is Peace;
 Joy Divine in Thee we prove,
 Light of Truth, and Fire and Love.
