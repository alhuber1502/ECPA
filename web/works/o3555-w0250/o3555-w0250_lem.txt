on the death of mrs. Jennings. 

it be past: dear venerable shade, farewell! 
thy blameless life thy peaceful death shall tell. 
clear to the last thy set orb have run;
 pure, bright, and healthy like a frosty sun:
 and late old age with hand indulgent shed
 its mild winter on thy favour head. 
for heaven prolong her life to spread its praise,
 and bless she with a patriarch length of day. 
the true praise be she, a cheerful heart,
 prone to enjoy, and ready to impart. 
a Israelite indeed, and free from guile,
 she show that piety and age can smile. 
religion have her heart, her care, her voice;
 it be her last refuge, as her early choice. 
to holy anna spirit not more dear
 the church of Israel, and the house of prayer. 
her spread offspring of the four degree
 fill her fond arm, and clasp her tremble knee. 
mature at length for some more perfect scene,
 her hope all bright, her prospect all serene,
 each part of life sustain with equal worth,
 and not a wish leave unfulfilled on earth,
 like a tire traveller with sleep oppress,
 within her childrens arm she drop to rest. 
farewell! thy cherish image, ever dear,
 shall many a heart with pious love revere:
 long, long shall mine her honour memory bless,
 who give the dear blessing i possess.
