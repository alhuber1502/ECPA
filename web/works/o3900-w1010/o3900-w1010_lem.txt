the believer support.

from the german. 

i 

o thou, to who all search sight
 the darkness shine as the light,
 search, prove my heart; it pant for thou:
 o burst these band, and set it free. 

ii.

wash out its stain, refine its dross,
 nail my affection to the cross! 
Hallow each thought: let all within
 be clean, as thou, my lord, be clean. 

iii.

if in this darksome wild i stray,
 be thou my light, be thou my way:
 no foe, no violence i fear,
 no fraud, while thou, my god, be near. 

iv.

when rise flood my head overflow,
 when sink my heart in wave of woe,
 Jesus, thy timely aid impart,
 and raise my head, and cheer my heart. 

v. 

Saviour, wherever thy step i see,
 dauntless, untired i follow thou:
 o let thy hand support i still,
 and lead i to thy holy hill. 

vi.

if rough and thorny be my way,
 my strength proportion to my day:
 till toil and grief, and pain shall cease,
 where all be calm, and joy, and peace.
