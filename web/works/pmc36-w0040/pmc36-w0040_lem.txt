to mrs. Boteler. a description of her garden.

how charm be this little spot
 dispose with art and taste. 
a thousand beauty intermix,
 prepare the eye a feast. 

the lovely lime in ample row,
 with woodbine climb round,
 a shine gravel walk enclose. 
where not a weed be find. 

the Crocus, Primrose, daffodil,
 and cowslip sweet, i sing;
 and fragrant purple violet,
 all harbinger of spring. 

the musky lovely blush pink,
 jonquil with rich perfume;
 tulip that vie with Iris' bow,
 and balsam annual bloom. 

the immortal pea, fair 'emone,
 and beamy marigold,
 and polyanthus (lovely tribe!) 
their various bloom unfold. 

the gard'ner pride ranunculus,
 bellflower ethereal blue,
 the rose Campion, and golden lupe,
 and wonder of Peru. 

the amarynth, as poet sing,
 that Juno deign to wear,
 that in hesperian garden spring,
 bloom fair and fragrant here. 

the lily fair as new fall snow;
 all these the border grace. 
and myrtle, rose, jessamin,
 with fragrance fill the place. 

a group of dwarfish apple tree
 appear, a fairy scene,
 load with fruit, such Paris give
 to Venus, beauty queen. 

stately the rise mount appear,
 with tower elm overspread;
 who gentle wave branch form,
 at noon, a cool shade. 

the laurel plant the victor crown,
 and bay by poet wear;
 the party-coloured Philaroy,
 and may perfume thorn. 

these line the walk, and make the bound
 all verdant young, and fair:
 all speak the owner judgement good,
 and praise the gard'ner care. 

faint emblem of a fair mind,
 that over all preside:
 for every virtue plant there,
 and every action guide.
