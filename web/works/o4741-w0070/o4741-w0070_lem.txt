on a good conscience.

the solid joy of human kind
 be those that flow from peace of mind;
 for who the sweet of life can taste,
 with vice, and timorous guilt, oppress? 
it be virtue soften all our toil,
 with peace our conscience crown;
 give pleasure, when our fortune smile,
 and courage, when it frown;
 calm every trouble, make the soul serene,
 smooth the contract brow, and cheer the heart within. 

while guilty mind, involve with woe,
 anticipate the future blow;
 which be (to make damnation more complete)
 the less hell, in passage to the great;
 bold and intrepid honest man appear;
 for, as they know no evil, none they fear:
 a glorious shield of virtue guard their breast;
 arm with themselves, they always walk at rest. 

thus, under burst cloud, and stormy sky,
 when thunder roar, and lightning fly,
 the imperial eagle bold rove,
 nor dread the firy bolt of Jove;
 while mean bird in secret creep below;
 and tremble fear, and often feel, the blow.
