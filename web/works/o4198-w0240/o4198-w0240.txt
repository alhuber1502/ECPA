BURLETTA. THE WOMAN OF SPIRIT.

1770.

THE WOMAN OF SPIRIT.

ACT I. SCENE I.

LATITAT.

I tell you Lady Tempest —


LADY TEMPEST.

And I tell you Mr. Latitat in shall not be. — I'll have no Society of Antiquaries meet here: None but the honourable Members of the Coterie shall assemble here — you shall know.


LATITAT.

Suspend your rage, Lady Tempest, and let me open my brief — have you not this day, moved by the instigation of the Devil, and not having the fear of God before your eyes, wilfully and wittingly, and maliciously driven all my friends out of my house. Was it done like a Woman of Quality?


LADY TEMPEST.

It was done like a Woman of Spirit: A character, it shall ever be my task to maintain.


AIR.

Away with your maxims, and dull formal rules
 The shackles of pleasure, and trammels of fools;
 For Wisdom and Prudence I care not a straw
 I'll act, as I please, for my Will is my Law. 

LATITAT.

But upon my soul Madam I have one more consideration which should especially move you to bridle your passion: for it spoils your face. When you knocked down Lord Rust with the Bust of Marcus Aurelius, you looked the very picture of the Alecto last taken out of the Herculaneum.


AIR.

Passion worse than age will plow
 Furrows on the frowning brow:
 Rage and passion will disgrace
 Every beauty of the face:
 Whil'st good nature will supply
 Beauties, which can never die. 

LADY TEMPEST.

Mr. Latitat I wont be abused — Did I for this condescend to forget my quality and marry such a Tautology of Nothing — I will not be abused.


SCENE [II].

DISTORT.

Pray Madam what has enraged you? May I have the honour of knowing.


LATITAT.

Mr. Distort shall be our Referee.


LADY TEMPEST.

That is, if I please Sir.


LATITAT.

Pray my Lady let me state the case, and you may afterwards make a reply — you must know Sir. —


LADY TEMPEST.

Yes, Sir, you must know, this morning, Mr. Latitat had invited all his antiquated friends Lord Rust, Horatio Trefoil, Col. Tragedus, Professor Vase and Countefeit the Jew to sit upon a brass half-penny, which being a little worn, they have agreed, Nem. Con. to be an Otho.


LATITAT.

And it is further necessary to be known, that, while we were all warm in debate upon the premises, my Lady made a forcible entry into the parlour, and seizing an antique Bust of Marcus Aurelius, of malice propense, and afore thought, did with three blows of the said Bust, knock down Anthony Viscount Rust, and —


LADY TEMPEST.

And drove them all out of the house.


LATITAT.

And furthermore —


LADY TEMPEST.

Silence Mr. Latitat, I insist on the priviledge of an English Wife.


LATITAT.

And moreover —


DISTORT.

Nay Councellor, as I am your Referee, I command silence: Pray what do you lay your damages at?


LATITAT.

My Lady has in her cabinet a Jupiter Tonans, which in spite of all my endeavours to open her eyes, she persists in calling an Indian Pagod, and upon condition of my receiving that, I drop the prosecution.


DISTORT (aside to Lady.) 

'Tis a trifle Madam let him have it, it may turn to account.


LADY TEMPEST.

A very toy: He shall have it instantly on condition I have the use of my tongue.


AIR.

What are all your favourite joys
 What are our pleasures.
