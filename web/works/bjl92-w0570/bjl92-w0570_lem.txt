to a lady who send the author some paper with a read of sillar poem.

dear madam, with joy i read over your letter;
 your kindness still tend to confirm i your debtor;
 but can think of payment, the sum be so large,
 though farthing for guinea can buy my discharge. 
but, madam, the muse be flee far away,
 they deem it disgrace with a milkmaid to stay. 
let they go if they will, i will scorn to pursue,
 and can, without sigh, subscribe a adieu. 
their trifle mock visit, to many so dear,
 be the only disaster on earth i now fear. 
sure sillar much better have banish they thence,
 than write in despite of good manner and sense:
 with two or three more, who pretention to fame
 be slight as the bubble that burst on the stream. 
and lest with such dunce as these i be number,
 the task i will drop, nor with verse be encumber;
 though pen, ink and paper, be by i in store,
 o madam excuse, for i never shall write more.
