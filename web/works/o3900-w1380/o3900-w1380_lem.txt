i 

rise my soul with ardor rise,
 breath thy wish to the sky;
 free pour out all thy mind,
 seek, and thou be sure to find;
 ready be thou to receive? 
ready be thy god to give. 

ii.

 hear, and show thou hear my call;
 let my cry thy throne assail
 enter now within the veil:
 give the benefit i claim —
 lord, i ask in jesus name! 

iii.

 answer my minute want,
 all my large thought require,
 grant i all my heart desire,
 give i, till my cup run over,
 all, and infinite more. 

iv.

meek and lowly be my mind,
 pure my heart, my will resign! 
keep i dead to all below,
 only Christ resolve to know,
 firm and disengage and free,
 seek all my bliss in thou. 

v.

 want what thou long to give,
 show i all thy goodness, lord,
 beam from the incarnate word,

 efflux of the light divine. 

vi.

 glory in thy perfect love. 

vii.

ix.

lord, i will not let thou go,
 till the bless thou bestow:
 hear my advocate divine;
 lo! to his my suit i join:
 join to his it can fail —
 bless i, for i will prevail! 

x. 

stoop from thy eternal throne,
 see, thy promise call thou down! 
high and lofty as thou be,
 dwell within my worthless heart! 
hear, a faint soul revive;
 here for ever walk and live. 

xi.

heavenly Adam, life divine,
 change my nature into thy:
 move and spread throughout my soul,
 actuate and fill the whole:
 be it i no long now,
 live in the flesh, but thou. 

xii.

holy ghost, no more delay,
 come, and in thy temple stay;
 now thy inward witness bear
 strong and permanent, and clear;
 spring of life, thyself impart,
 rise eternal in my heart!
