a song. 

persuade i not, there be a grace
 proceed from silvia voice or lute,
 against miranda charm face
 to make she hold the least dispute. 

music, which tune the soul for love,
 and stir up all our soft desire,
 do but the grow flame improve,
 which powerful beauty first inspire. 

thus, while with art she play, and sing,
 i to Miranda, stand by,
 impute the music of the string,
 and all the melt word apply.
