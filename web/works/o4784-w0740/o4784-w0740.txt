A SONG. 

PErsuade me not, there is a Grace
 Proceeds from Silvia's Voice or Lute,
 Against Miranda's charming Face
 To make her hold the least Dispute. 

Musick, which tunes the Soul for Love,
 And stirs up all our soft Desires,
 Do's but the growing Flame improve,
 Which pow'rful Beauty first inspires. 

Thus, whilst with Art she plays, and sings,
 I to Miranda, standing by,
 Impute the Musick of the Strings,
 And all the melting Words apply.
