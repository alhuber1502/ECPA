a prayer, in the prospect of death.

i 

o thou unknown, almighty cause
 of all my hope and fear! 
in who dread presence, ere a hour,
 perhaps i must appear! 

ii.

if i have wander in those path
 of life i ought to shun;
 as something, loud, in my breast,
 remonstrate i have do;

iii.

thou know that thou have form i,
 with passion wild and strong;
 and: listen, to their witch voice
 have often lead i wrong. 

iv.

where human weakness have come short,
 or frailty step aside,
 do thou, allgood, for such thou be,
 in shade of darkness hide. 

v. 

where with intention i have err,
 no other plea i have,
 but, thou be good; and goodness still
 delight to forgive.
