ode, to a lady. 

on the death of col. Charles Ross, in the action at Fontenoy. write may 1745.

by mr. W. Collins.

i 

while, lose to all his former mirth,
britannia genius bend to earth,
and mourn the fatal day;
while, stain with blood, he strive to tear
unseemly from his sea-green hair
the wreath of cheerful may;

ii.

the thought which muse pity pay,
and fond remembrance love to raise,
your faithful hour attend;
still fancy, to herself unkind,
awake to grief the soften mind,
and point the bleed friend.

iii.

by rapid scheld descend wave
his country vow shall bless the grave,
whereve the youth be lay:
that sacred spot the village hind
with every sweet turf shall bind,
and peace protect the shade.

iv.

over he, who doom thy virtue grieve,
aÃ«rial form shall sit at eve
and bend the pensive head!
and, fall to save his injure land,
imperial honour awful hand
shall point his lonely bed!

v. 

the warlike dead of every age,
who fill the fair record page,
shall leave their saint rest:
and, half-reclining on his spear,
each wonder chief by turn appear,
to hail the bloom guest.

vi.

old Edward son, unknown to yield,
shall crowd from cressy laureled field,
and gaze with fix delight;
again for britain wrong they feel,
again they snatch the gleamy steel,
and wish the avenge fight.

vii.

if, weak to sooth so soft a heart,
these picture glory nought impart
to dry thy constant tear;
if yet in sorrow distant eye,
expose and pale thou see he lie,
wild war insult near.

viii.

whereve from time thou court relief,
the muse shall still with social grief
her gentle promise keep:
even humble Harting cottaged vale
shall learn the sad repeat tale,
and bid her shepherd weep.
