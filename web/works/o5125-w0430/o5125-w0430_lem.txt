the proposal.

with ache finger, twing nose,
 and vex, dear madam, we will suppose:
 (to leave yourself and parlour-fire)
 trudge Mira to her own good sire;
 beneath a cold and gloomy sky
 walk cheek by jowl the muse and i:
 the listen gossip, though unseen,
 have watch the talk that pass between
 myself and you: and much offend
 (it seem) at what be there intend. 
 'so cry the peevish maid, (and squint)
'methinks i hear you talk of Printing:
 'have i bestow a world of pain,
'to spirit up your blockish brain,
 'to get from thence a idle rhyme,
'that make i blush to call it i? 
 'and shall i see the cripple crew
'discard from their seat and you,
 'turn out to skip from hand to hand
'in dirty gazette round the land,
 'to grace the knee of every sot,
'and catch the droppings of his pot,
 'while in a rage the drowsy swain
'perhaps may curse you for your pain,
 'protest with a critic spite,
'that none since Durfey know to write? 
 'but, Mira, if you want a muse,
'to grace the page of weekly news,
 'the task be much too low for i,
'yet I have a maid of less degree,
 '(with spirit suit to her state)
'will serve you at a easy rate:
 'who voice, though hoarse, be loud and strong,
'a artist at a rant song,
 'can chant lampoon without much strain,
'or epigram with double mean,
 'to join the tavern-harp or viol:
'now if you will take she upon trial,
 'to her deserve suit your pay,
'and then you take the safe way:
 'perhaps you will prosper in the end,
'i will say no more: but ask your friend,
 'here end the muse â€” dear madam, say,
'shall i reject she or obey?
