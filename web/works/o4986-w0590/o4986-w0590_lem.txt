a ode.

by s—l j—n, l. l.  d. 

stern winter now by spring repress,
 forbear the long-continued strife,
 and nature on her naked breast
 delight to catch the gale of life. 

now, over the rural kingdom rove
 soft pleasure, with her laugh train,
 love warble in the vocal grove,
 and vegetation plant the plain. 

unhappy! who to bed of pain
 arthritic tyranny consign,
 who smile nature court in vain,
 though rapture sing, and beauty shine. 

yet though my limb disease invade,
 her wing imagination try,
 and bear i to the peaceful shade,
 where have humble turret rise. 

here stop, my soul, thy rapid flight,
 nor from the please grove depart,
 where first great nature charm my sight,
 where wisdom first inform my heart. 

here let i through the vale pursue
 a guide, a father, and a friend;
 once more great nature work renew,
 once more on wisdom voice attend. 

from false caress, causeless strife,
 wild hope, vain fear, alike remove;
 here let i learn the use of life,
 when best enjoy, when most improve. 

teach i, thou venerable bower,
 cool meditation quiet seat,
 the generous scorn of venal power,
 the silent grandeur of retreat. 

when pride by guilt to greatness climb,
 or rage faction rush to war;
 here let i learn to shun the crime
 i can prevent, and will not share. 

but, lest i fall by subtle foe,
 bright wisdom, teach i curio art,
 the swell passion to compose,
 and quell the rebel of the heart.
