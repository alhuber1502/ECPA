to a despond friend.

repine not, pensive friend, to meet
a thorn and sting in every sweet;
think it not you or my hard fate,
but the fix lot of humane state.
since then this portion be assign,
by the great patron of mankind,
(though never so dark understand)
we shall presume the method good. 
heaven do its tendere care express
conduct through a wilderness,
lest sluggard we shall take our stand
and stop short of the promise land.
