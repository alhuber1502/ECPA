To a Desponding Friend.

REpine not, pensive Friend, to meet
A Thorn and Sting in ev'ry Sweet;
Think it not yours or my hard Fate,
But the fixt Lot of Humane State.
Since then this Portion is Assign'd,
By the great Patron of Mankind,
(Though nere so darkly Understood)
We shou'd presume the Method Good. 
Heav'n do's its tendrest Care express
Conducting through a Wilderness,
Lest Sluggards we shou'd Take our Stand
And stop short of the Promis'd Land.
