To Madam Sâ€” at the Court.

I.

COme prethee leave the Courts
 And range the Fields with me;
 A thousand pretty Rural sports
 I'le here invent for thee. 

II.

Involv'd in blissful innocence
 Wee'l spend the shining day,
 Untoucht with that mean influence
 The duller world obey. 

III.

About the flowry Plains wee'l rove,
 As gay and unconsin'd:
 As are inspir'd by thee and love
 The saleys of my mind. 

IV.

Now seated by a lovely Stream,
 Where beauteous Mermaids haunt;
 My Song while William is my Theam,
 Shall them and thee inchant. 

V.

Then in some gentle soft retreat;
 Secure as Venus Groves,
 We'l all the charming things repeat,
 That introduuc'd our loves. 

VI.

I'le pluck fresh Garlands for thy brows,
 Sweet as a Zephirs breath. 
As fair and well design'd as those
 The Elisyum Lovers wreath. 

VII.

And like those happy Lovers we,
 As careless and as blest;
 Shall in each others converse be
 Of the whole world possest. 

VIII.

Then prethee Phillis leave the Courts,
 And range the Fields with me;
 Since I so many harmless sports
 Can here procure for thee.
