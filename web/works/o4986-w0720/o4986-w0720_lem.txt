the three warn:

a tale.

by mrs. Thrale.

the tree of deep root be find
 least will still to quit the ground;
 it be therefore say by ancient sage,
 that love of life increase with year
 so much, that in our latter stage,
 when pain grow sharp, and sickness rage,
 the great love of life appear. 

this great affection to believe,
 which all confess, but few perceive,
 if old assertion can prevail,
 be please to hear a modern tale. 
when sport go round, and all be gay
 on neighbour dobson wedding-day,
 death call aside the jocund groom
 with he into another room:
 and look grave, "you must, say he,
" quit your sweet bride, and come with i. " 
" with you, and quit my Susan side! 
 "with you! the hapless husband cry:
" young as i be! it be monstrous hard! 
 "beside, in truth, i be not prepare:
" my thought on other matter go,
 "this be my wedding-night, you know." 
what more he urge i have not hear,
 his reason can not well be strong;
 so death the poor delinquent spare,
 and leave to live a little long. 
yet call up a serious look,
 his hourglass tremble while he speak,
 "neighbour, he say, farewell: no more
" shall death disturb your mirthful hour;
 "and further, to avoid all blame
" of cruelty upon my name,
 "to give you time for preparation,
" and fit you for your future station,
 "three several warn you shall have,
" before you be summon to the grave:
 "will for once i will quit my prey,
" and grant a kind reprieve;
 "in hope you will have no more to say,
" but when i call again this way,
 "well-pleased the world will leave." 

to these condition both consent,
 and part perfect content. 

what next the hero of our tale befall,
 how long he live, how wise, how well,
 how round he pursue his course,
 and smoke his pipe, and stroke his horse,
 the will muse shall tell:
 he chaffer then, he buy, he sell,
 nor once perceive his grow old,
 nor think of death as near;
 his friend not false, his wife no shrew,
 many his gain, his child few,
 he pass his hour in peace;
 but while he view his wealth increase,
 while thus along life dusty road
 the beat track content he tread,
 old time, who haste no mortal spare,
 uncalled, unheeded, unaware,
 bring on his eightieth year. 

and now one night in muse mood,
 as all alone he sit,
 the unwelcome messenger of fate
 once more before he stand. 

half kill with anger and surprise,
 "so soon return! old Dobson cry." 
 "so soon, do you call it! death reply:
" sure, my friend, you be but in jest. 
 "since i be here before,
" it be six-and-thirty year at least,
 "and you be now fourscore." 
 "so much the worse, the clown rejoin:
" to spare the age will be kind:
 "however, see your search be legal;
" and your authority — be it regal? 
 "else you be come on a fool errand,
" with but a ecretary warrant. 
 "beside, you promise i three warn,
" which i have look for night and morning. 
 "but for that loss of time and ease,
" i can recover damage. " 
" i know, cry death, that at the best,
 "i seldom be a welcome guest;
" but do be captious, friend, at least;
 "i little thought you will still be able
" to stump about your farm and stable;
 "your year have run to a great length,
" i wish you joy though of your strength. " 
" hold, say the farmer, not so fast,
 "i have be lame these four year past." 
 "and no great wonder, death reply,
" however, you still keep your eye;
 "and sure to see one love and friend,
" for leg and arm will make amends. " 
" perhaps, say Dobson, so it may,
 "but latterly i have lose my sight." 
 "this be a shock story, faith,
" yet there be some comfort still, say death;
 "each strive your sadness to amuse;
" i warrant you hear all the news. " 
" there be none, cry he; and if there be,
 "I be grow so deaf i can not hear." 
 "nay then, the spectre stern rejoin,
" these be unjustifiable yearn;
 "if you be lame, and deaf, and blind,
" you have have your three sufficient warn. 
 "so come along, no more we will part:"
 he say, and touch he with his dart;
 and now old Dobson turn pale,
 yield to his fate — so end my tale.
