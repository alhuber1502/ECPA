the kitten.

wanton droll, who harmless play
 beguile the rustic close day,
 when, draw the evening fire about,
 sit age crone and thoughtless lout,
 and child upon his three-foot stool,
 wait till his supper cool,
 and maid, who cheek outbloom the rose,
 as bright the blaze faggot glow,
 who, bend to the friendly light,
 ply her task with busy slight;
 come, show thy trick and sportive grace,
 thus circle round with merry face. 

backward coil and crouch low,
 with glare eyeball watch thy foe,
 the housewife spindle whirl round,
 or thread or straw that on the ground
 its shadow throw, by urchin sly
 hold out to lure thy rove eye;
 then steal onward, fierce spring
 upon the tempt faithless thing. 
now, wheel round with bootless skill,
 thy bopeep tail provoke thou still,
 as still beyond thy curving side
 its jetty tip be see to glide;
 till from thy centre start far,
 thou sidelong veer'st with rump in air
 erect stiff, and gait awry,
 like madam in her tantrum high;
 though never a madam of they all,
 who silken kirtle sweep the hall,
 more vary trick and whim display
 to catch the admire stranger gaze. 

do power in measure verse dwell,
 all thy vagary wild to tell? 
ah no! — the start, the jet, the bound,
 the giddy scamper round and round,
 with leap and toss and high curvet,
 and many a whirl somerset,
 (permit by the modern muse
 expression technical to use)
 these mock the deft rhymester skill,
 but poor in art though rich in will. 

the feat tumbler, stage bedight,
 to thou be but a clumsy wight,
 who every limb and sinew strain
 to do what cost thou little pain;
 for which, i trow, the gape crowd
 requite he oft with plaudit loud. 

but, stop the while thy wanton play,
 applause too thy pain repay:
 for then, beneath some urchin hand
 with modest pride thou take thy stand,
 while many a stroke of kindness glide
 along thy back and tabby side. 
dilate swell thy glossy fur,
 and loud croon thy busy pur,
 as, time well the equal sound,
 thy clutch foot bepat the ground,
 and all their harmless claw disclose
 like prickle of a early rose,
 while soft from thy whisker cheek
 thy half-closed eye peer, mild and meek. 

but not alone by cottage fire
 do rustic rude thy feat admire. 
the learned sage, who thought explore
 the wide range of human lore,
 or with unfettered fancy fly
 through airy height of poesy,
 pause smile with alter air
 to see thou climb his elbow-chair,
 or, struggle on the mat below,
 hold warfare with his slipper toe. 
the widow dame or lonely maid,
 who, in the still but cheerless shade
 of home unsocial, spend her age
 and rare turn a letter page,
 upon her hearth for thou let fall
 the round cork or paper ball,
 nor chide thou on thy wicked watch,
 the end of ravel skein to catch,
 but let thou have thy wayward will,
 perplex oft her better skill. 

even he, who mind of gloomy bent,
 in lonely tower or prison pen,
 review the coil of former day,
 and loathe the world and all its way,
 what time the lamp unsteady gleam
 have rouse he from his moody dream,
 feel, as thou gambol round his seat,
 his heart of pride less fierce beat,
 and smile, a link in thou to find,
 that join it still to live kind. 

whence have thou then, thou witless puss! 
the magic power to charm we thus? 
be it that in thy glare eye
 and rapid movement, we descry —
 while we at ease, secure from ill,
 the chimney corner snug fill —
 a lion dart on his prey,
 a tiger at his ruthless play? 
or be it that in thou we trace
 with all thy vary wanton grace,
 a emblem, view with kindred eye,
 of tricky, restless infancy? 
ah! many a light sportive child,
 who have like thou our wit beguile,
 to dull and sober manhood grow,
 with strange recoil our heart disown. 

and so, poor kit! must thou endure,
 when thou become a cat demure,
 full many a cuff and angry word,
 chase rough from the tempt board. 
but yet, for that thou have, i ween,
 so oft our favour playmate be,
 soft be the change which thou shall prove! 
when time have spoil thou of our love,
 still be thou deem by housewife fat
 a comely, careful, mouse cat,
 who dish be, for the public good,
 replenish oft with savoury food. 
nor, when thy span of life be past,
 be thou to pond or dunghill cast,
 but, gentle bear on goodman spade,
 beneath the decent sod be lay;
 and child show with glisten eye
 the place where poor old pussy lie.
