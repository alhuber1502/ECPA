song.

to wander alone when the moon faint beam,
 with glimmer lustre dart through the dim shade,
 where owl seek for covert, and night bird complain,
 add sound to the horror that darken the glade. 

it be not for the happy, come daughter of sorrow,
 it be here thy sad thought be embalm in thy tear,
 where lose in the past, nor regard tomorrow,
 there be nothing for hope, there be nothing for fear.
