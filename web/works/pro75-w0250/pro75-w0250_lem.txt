to love: write extempore.

i

resistless power, ah! wherefore reign,
alone among the rural train,
be it because you seldom find,
the giddy throng to truth incline.

ii

ah! wherefore in the modish breast,
be thou so rare find a guest,
must fashion occupy thy place,
and custom, hymens charm efface.

iii

alas! how few be bear to prove,
the joy of undissembled love,
how few can boast a generous flame,
inspire by virtue sacred name.

iv

be it because thou be partial grow,
and yield to beauty power alone,
must merit plead her right in vain,
and mourn for truth unpitied pain.

v

in vain be every grace combine,
to elevate the youthful mind,
if nature join not to disclose,
the lily and the blush rose.

vi

you youth of this licentious age,
no more in idle care engage,
no long artful scene pursue,
but grant to merit â€” all its due.
