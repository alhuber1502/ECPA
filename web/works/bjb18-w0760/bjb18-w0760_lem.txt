hymn.

my god! will that, from earthly trammel free,
 my thought can win their upward way to thou,
 and there a while in lofty region prove,
 the purify glow of holy love! 

the solemn dome of night be over my head,
 where countless star in grand array be spread —
 thy mighty host, that to our wonder eye
 one maze of glory be; while somber lie
 beneath its vasty span the darken face
 of many a land, where many a motley race,
 with all their worldly care, in sleep be leap. 
o, may my soul, in adoration rapt,
 her high concentre thought still raise to thou,
 with steady power! alas, this may not be! 
my thought be twilight bird, in season rare,
 that skim and rise, and flit in nether air;
 that wheel, and turn, and cross, and soar, and swoop,
 with seem bootless speed, then feeble droop
 their weary wing, which may no more sustain
 such flight, and hie to murky haunt again. 

my god, who know the creature thou have make,
 pity my weakness, nor as sin be lay
 upon my head, this feebleness of mind;
 and if sublime thought i may not bind,
 as the abide treasure of my heart —
 inmate, who rare from their cell depart,
 vouchsafe such grace, that many a transient notion
 may oft within i kindle true devotion;
 and, move as a meteor of the night,
 be for a pass, glorious moment bright, —
 a moment, utter in word of fire,
 "thou be our mighty lord, our good and bounteous sire."
