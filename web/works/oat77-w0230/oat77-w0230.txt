The Parting.

HEre do I fix my Foot, and Farewell Love! 
I will no further move.
When first in Errour's Misty Night
I lost my self, and rov'd about,
This Ignis-fatuus found me out,
Before me rol'd with Wanton Play,
And beg'd to bring me on my Way.
Rashly I follow'd the seducing Fire
Through briny Floods of Tears,
Mongst Thorny Iealousies and Fears,
O're Praecipices of Despair,
And where no Passage did appear,
Oft have I forc't a Path, but now I Tire.
What Glympse was that which struck my Eye
From yonder Skie?
Welcome bright Harbinger of Day;
By thee I know the Sun is on his way.
What Desert's this? â€” Alas! I fear I'm Stray'd,
And after all my Toil and Fright
In this Tempestuous Night,
By my Officious Guide Betray'd.
Oh! when shall I arrive at the Abode
Of Happy Souls (since they that earliest strive
To reach that Stage, are late e're they Arrive)
I, who am Cumbred with so vast a Load
Of Vain Desires, and have alas!
So many a weary step to pass
Ere I redress my Stray's, & get into the Road.
