sonnet.

the peaceful joy which virtue give,
she give without allay,
hope, recollect, or enjoy,
they gild life bright day.

you peaceful shade! you flowery lawn!
you stream which murmur by!
it be innocence which make your charm
so grateful to the eye.

and you, who trace the blue expanse,
or sport upon the green,
sweet sympathy attract my mind,
with you to taste the scene.

then piety and friendship pure,
and soft benevolence,
improve to i whatever of good,
kind heaven shall here dispense.
