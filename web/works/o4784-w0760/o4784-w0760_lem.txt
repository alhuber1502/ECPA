a song. 

love, thou be best of human joy,
 our chief happiness below;
 all other pleasure be but toy,
 music without thou be but noise,
 and beauty but a empty show. 

heaven, who know best what man will move,
 and raise his thought above the brute;
 say, let he be, and let he love;
 that must alone his soul improve,
 however philosopher dispute.
