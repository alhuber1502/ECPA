SONG XXVI.

An EVENING SONG.

I.

AND now another Day is gone,
 I'll sing my Maker's Praise;
 My Comforts ev'ry Hour make known
 His Providence and Grace. 

II.

But how my Childhood runs to waste! 
My Sins, how great their Sum! 
LORD, give me Pardon for the past;
 And Strength for Days to come. 

III.

I lay my Body down to Sleep;
 Let Angels guard my Head,
 And thro' the Hours of Darkness keep
 Their Watch around my Bed. 

IV.

With cheerful Heart I close my Eyes,
 Since thou wilt not remove;
 And in the Morning let me rise
 Rejoicing in thy Love.
