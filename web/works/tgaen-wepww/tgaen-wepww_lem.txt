[epitaph on sir William Williams]

here, foremost in the dangerous path of fame,
young Williams fight for England fair renown;
his mind each muse, each grace adorn his frame,
nor envy dare to view he with a frown.

at Aix uncalled his maiden sword he draw,
(there first in blood his infant glory seal);
from fortune, pleasure, science, love, he fly,
and scorn repose when Britain take the field.

with eye of flame and cool intrepid breast,
victor he stand on Belle isle rocky steep;
ah gallant youth! this marble tell the rest,
where melancholy friendship bend and weep.
