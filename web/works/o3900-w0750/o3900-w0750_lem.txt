free grace.

and can it be, that i shall gain
 a interest in the saviour blood! 
die he for i? — who cause his pain! 
for i? — who he to death pursue. 
amaze love! how can it be
 that thou, my god, shall die for i? 

ii.

it be mystery all! the immortal die! 
who can explore his strange design? 
in vain the firstborn seraph try
 to sound the depth of love divine. 
it be mercy all! let earth adore;
 let angel mind inquire no more. 

iii.

he leave his father throne above,
 (so free, so infinite his grace!) 
empty himself of all but love,
 and bleed for Adam helpless race:
 it be mercy all, immense and free! 
for o my god! it find out i! 

iv.

long my imprison spirit lie,
 fast bind in sin and nature night:
 thy eye diffuse a quicken ray;
 i wake; the dungeon flame with light;
 my chain fall off, my heart be free,
 i rise, go forth, and follow thou. 

v. 

still the small inward voice i hear,
 that whisper all my sin forgive;
 still the aton blood be near,
 that quench the wrath of hostile heaven:
 i fall the life his wound impart;
 i feel my saviour in my heart. 

vi.

no condemnation now i dread,
 Jesus, and all in he, be i:
 alive in he, my live head,
 and clothe in righteousness divine,
 bold i approach the eternal throne,
 and claim the crown, through Christ, my own.
