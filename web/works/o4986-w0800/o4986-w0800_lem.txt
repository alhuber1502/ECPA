by the same.

occasion by leave b—r—n, July 1755.  the author tell the lady “he look upon himself in a worse situation than ADAM banish paradise,” be enjoin by they to express the same in rhime.

when our first father through the dreary waste
 from eden plain a exile sad must go,
 oft he recall each scene of pleasure past,
 feel the dire change, and bid his sorrow flow. 

yet still a sweet companion of his woe
 with soft, assiduous care attend near;
 fond to relieve, and resolute to show
 the soothe smile, or sympathize tear. 

far happy doom, alas! attend i here,
 who leave of nymph so fair a train behind,
 nor one be find the tedious way to cheer,
 or raise with converse sweet the droop mind:
 then tell i, fair one, can i choose but grieve,
 who quit my paradise without a eve?
