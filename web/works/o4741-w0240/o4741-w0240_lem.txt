to mr. worsdale: occasion by see celia picture unfinished.

write extempore at Kensington. 

yet, worsdale, yet, thou must exert thy art,
 to paint the matchless virtue of her heart:
 it be not enough, that wit and beauty join;
 but, in her face, let sense and judgement shine;
 let godlike bounty crown her generous soul,
 and solid wisdom dignify the whole:
 so, in thy piece, shall each beholder see
 a finish Celia her, a kneller thou.
