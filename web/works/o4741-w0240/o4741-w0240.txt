To Mr. WORSDALE: Occasion'd by seeing CELIA's Picture unfinish'd.

Writ extempore at Kensington. 

YET, WORSDALE, yet, thou must exert thy Art,
 To paint the matchless Virtues of her Heart:
 'Tis not enough, that Wit and Beauty join;
 But, in her Face, let Sense and Judgment shine;
 Let godlike Bounty crown her gen'rous Soul,
 And solid Wisdom dignify the Whole:
 So, in thy Piece, shall each Beholder see
 A finish'd CELIA Her, a KNELLER Thee.
