To Mrs. Frances-Arabella Kelly, with a Present of Fruit.

By the Same. 

Tho' the Plumb, and the Peach, with Apollo conspire,
 To present you their Softness, and Sweetness, and Fire;
 Their Aid is in vain; for what can they do,
 But blush, and confess them selves vanquish'd by you? 
Where Virtue and Wit with such Qualities blend,
 What Mortal, what Goddess, would dare to contend?
