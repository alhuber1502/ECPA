flower.

by Anthony Whistler, ESQ;

i 

let sage, with superfluous pain,
the learned page devour;
while florio better knowledge drain
from each instructive flower.

ii.

his favourite rise his fear alarm,
all open to the sun;
like vain coquette, who spread their charm,
and shine, to be undo.

iii.

the tulip, gaudy in its dress,
and make for nought but show,
in every sense, may well express
the glitter, empty beau!

iv.

the snowdrop first but peep to light,
and fearful show its head;
thus modest merit shine more bright,
by self-distrust mislead.

v. 

the Auric'la, which through labour rise,
yet shine complete by art,
the force of education show;
how much it can impart.

vi.

he mark the sensitive nice fit;
nor fear he to proclaim,
if each man darling vice be hit,
that he will act the same. 

vii.

beneath each common hedge, he view
the violet, with care;
hint we shall not worth refuse,
although we find it there. 

viii.

the tuberose that lofty spring,
nor can support its height,
well represent imperious king,
grow impotent by might.

ix.

fragrant, though pale, the lily blow;
to teach the female breast,
how virtue can its sweet disclose
in all complexion dress.

x. 

to every bloom that crown the year,
nature some charm decree;
learn hence, you nymph, her face to wear,
you can fail to please.
