ON THE VIOLENT DEBATES IN THE HOUSE OF PEERS, UPON THE BILL FOR SUSPENDING THE HABEAS CORPUS, &c.

My noble Lords, your altercation
 Can never tend to serve the nation,
 You can't but know its laws;
 Why then, right noble Peers, this pother,
 As if each culprit were your brother,
 That thus you plead their cause? 

Prythee, my Lords, be quiet then,
 Strive to acquit yourselves like men,
 Who hold a sacred trust;
 Your Church, your King, your Country calls
 For unity within your walls,
 For measures firm and just.
