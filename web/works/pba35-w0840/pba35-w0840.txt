To Dr. Mead, on his Cape Wine.

Your Wine, by Southern Suns refin'd,
 Is a just Emblem of your Mind:
 Like You, the gen'rous Juice displays
 Its Influence a thousand Ways;
 Like You, it raises sinking Hearts,
 Inspiring, and rewarding Arts;
 Dispels the Spleen, and conquers Pain,
 Calls back departing Life again.
