ON A GENTLEMAN'S PROPOSING TO TRAVEL 300 MILES TO SEE J—. H—. ESQ.'S CHILD. 

IS it true! does Alonzo from London propose
 A visit to Scotia's bleak plain,
 Ere the beams of bright Sol have dispersed our snows,
 Or the warblers enliven'd their strain? 

Does the city prove irksome, insipid the ball,
 Nor the theatre claim a delay? 
Is it friendship or int'rest that ushers the call,
 Which he seems in such haste to obey? 

I ask'd, and in whispers, by Fame I was told,
 That his heart was by int'rest unmov'd,
 That the ties of pure friendship were stronger than gold,
 And it's exquisite charms he had prov'd. 

But ah! he is gone, whose reception so kind,
 Would have fully compensate his toil! 
Can the sight of a babe give solace to his mind,
 Or reward the fatigue by a smile? 

Let the trifling vain clamours of stoics be mute,
 While friendship directeth the scales:
 Let them wonder, but never attempt to dispute,
 While self o'er their feelings prevails. 

In vain let them guess what Alonzo must know,
 Since friendship each action inspires;
 His presence will tend to alleviate wo,
 That done, it is all he desires.
