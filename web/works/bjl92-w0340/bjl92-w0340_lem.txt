on a gentleman propose to travel 300 mile to see J—. h—. ESQ.'S child. 

be it true! do Alonzo from London propose
 a visit to scotia bleak plain,
 ere the beam of bright Sol have disperse our snow,
 or the warbler enliven their strain? 

do the city prove irksome, insipid the ball,
 nor the theatre claim a delay? 
be it friendship or interest that usher the call,
 which he seem in such haste to obey? 

i ask, and in whisper, by fame i be tell,
 that his heart be by interest unmoved,
 that the tie of pure friendship be strong than gold,
 and it be exquisite charm he have prove. 

but ah! he be go, who reception so kind,
 will have full compensate his toil! 
can the sight of a babe give solace to his mind,
 or reward the fatigue by a smile? 

let the trifle vain clamour of stoic be mute,
 while friendship direct the scale:
 let they wonder, but never attempt to dispute,
 while self over their feeling prevail. 

in vain let they guess what Alonzo must know,
 since friendship each action inspire;
 his presence will tend to alleviate woe,
 that do, it be all he desire.
