BOOK I. Ep. 40.

Is there, t' enroll amongst the friendly few,
Whose names pure faith and ancient fame renew?
Is there, enrich'd with Virtue's honest store,
Deep vers'd in Latian and Athenian lore?
Is there, who right maintains and truth pursues,
Nor knows a wish that heaven can refuse?
Is there, who can on his great self depend?
Now let me die, but Harris is this friend.
