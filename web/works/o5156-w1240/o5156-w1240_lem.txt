book i ep. 40. 

be there, to enrol among the friendly few,
who name pure faith and ancient fame renew?
be there, enrich with virtue honest store,
deep verse in latian and athenian lore?
be there, who right maintain and truth pursue,
nor know a wish that heaven can refuse?
be there, who can on his great self depend?
now let i die, but HARRIS be this friend.
