epistle from the late lord viscount b—gb—ke to miss LUCY a—k—ns.

dear thoughtless Clara to my verse attend,
believe for once thy lover and thy friend;
heaven to each sex have various gift assign,
and show a equal care of humankind;
strength do to man imperial race belong,
to you that beauty which subdue the strong;
but as our strength when misapply, be lose,
and what shall save, urge our ruin most;
just so, when beauty prostitute lie,
of bawd the prey, of rake the abandon prize,
woman no more their empire can maintain,
nor hope, vile slave of lust, by love to reign.
superior charm but make their case the worse,
and what shall be their blessing, prove their curse.
oh nymph! that might, recline on Cupid breast,
like Psyche, sooth the god of love to rest;
or, if ambition move thou, Jove enthrall,
brandish his thunder, and direct its fall;
survey thyself, contemplate every grace
of that sweet form, of that angelic face,
then Clara say, be those delicious charm
mean for lewd brothel, and rude ruffian arm?
no Clara, no! that person, and that mind,
be form by nature, and by heaven design
for noble end; to these return, though late,
return to these, and so avert thy fate.
think Clara, think, (nor will that thought be vain)
thy slave, thy harry, doom to drag his chain
of love, ill-treated and abuse, that he
from more inglorious chain may rescue thou.
thy droop health restore; by his fond care,
once more thy beauty its full lustre wear;
move by his love, by his example teach,
soon shall thy soul, once more with virtue fraught,
with kind and generous truth thy bosom warm,
and thy fair mind, like thy fair person, charm.
to virtue thus, and to thyself restore,
by all admire, by one alone adore,
be to thy harry ever kind and true,
and live for he, who more than die for you.
