a character.

how very rare my generous friend we find,
a woman bless with such a virtuous mind,
a mind, unawed by any idle fear,
a heart which noble dare to be sincere,
a soul without ambition, true great,
sprightly, yet wise, and witty, though sedate.
with every heaven-born virtue ample fraught,
by prudence, piety, and reason teach;
a bosom, awe by chastity and love,
a tongue, ordain, the hard heart to move;
a ear, for ever open to the poor,
a breast, that be guide by no idle power;
a form as spotless as her heavenly mind,
in temper affable, polite, and kind.
