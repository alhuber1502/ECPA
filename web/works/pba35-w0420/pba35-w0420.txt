An Apology written for my Son to the Reverend Mr. Sampson, who had invited some Friends to celebrate Lord Carteret's Birth-Day, at Mount-Carteret near Dublin; and desir'd my Son to write on that Occasion.

With Joy your Summons we obey,
 And come to celebrate this Day. 
Yet I, alas! despair to please;
 For you require exalted Lays:
 And, let me write whate'er I will,
 You'll think my Verse deficient still;
 Altho' the Task I now decline,
 Asks no Assistance from the Nine;
 For Nature, better far than Art,
 Can paint the honest, grateful Heart. 

Heav'n knows how much I rack'd my Head,
 (For beaten Paths I scorn to tread)
 To tell the Vice-Roy something new,
 Who graciously distinguish'd you;
 Who had your Merit in his Eye,
 When Prelates often pass'd it by. 
What Blessings must the People share,
 Where Virtue is the Ruler's Care! 

Some Lines I wrote; which seem'd so fine,
 My Mother cry'd, "They can't be thine:
 (Alas! there needs but little Care
 In Sons, to please a Mother's Ear)
"Maro might own such Lines as these,
 "Nor with more Elegance could praise:
"This is the true poetic Fire:
 "But such a Subject must inspire:
"What beauteous Images are here! 
 "Constantia help'd you now, I fear:
"It must be so; you are not able â€”
 Then I by Chance upon the Table
 The Birth of manly Virtue spy'd;
 So threw my useless Pen aside. 
And set my Verses in a Flame,
 Nor dar'd to touch the hallow'd Theme:
 For there the God his Pow'r displays,
 And leaves no Room for mortal Praise.
