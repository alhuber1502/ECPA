a apology write for my son to the reverend mr. Samson, who have invite some friend to celebrate lord carteret birthday, at Mount-Carteret near Dublin; and desire my son to write on that occasion.

with joy your summons we obey,
 and come to celebrate this day. 
yet i, alas! despair to please;
 for you require exalt lay:
 and, let i write whatever i will,
 you will think my verse deficient still;
 although the task i now decline,
 ask no assistance from the nine;
 for nature, better far than art,
 can paint the honest, grateful heart. 

heaven know how much i rack my head,
 (for beat path i scorn to tread)
 to tell the vice-roy something new,
 who gracious distinguish you;
 who have your merit in his eye,
 when prelate often pass it by. 
what blessing must the people share,
 where virtue be the ruler care! 

some line i write; which seem so fine,
 my mother cry, "they can be thy:
 (alas! there need but little care
 in son, to please a mother ear)
"Maro may own such line as these,
 "nor with more elegance can praise:
"this be the true poetic fire:
 "but such a subject must inspire:
"what beauteous image be here! 
 "Constantia help you now, i fear:
"it must be so; you be not able â€”
 then i by chance upon the table
 the birth of manly virtue spy;
 so throw my useless pen aside. 
and set my verse in a flame,
 nor dare to touch the hallow theme:
 for there the god his power display,
 and leave no room for mortal praise.
