ode to a aeolus's harp.

send to miss Shepheard.

by the same.

yes, magic lyre! now all complete
thy slender frame responsive ring,
while kindred note with undulation sweet
accordant wake from all thy vocal string.
go then to she, who soft request
bid my bless hand thy form prepare;
ah go, and sweet sooth her tender breast
with many a warble wild, and artless air.
for know, full oft, while over the mead
bright June extend her fragrant reign.
the fair shall place thou near her slumber head
to court the gale that cool the sultry plain;
then shall the sylph, and sylphid bright,
mild genii all, to who high care
her virgin charm be give, in circle flight
skim sportive round thou in the field of air.
some, flutter amid thy tremble string,
shall catch the rich melodious spoil,
and light brush thou with their purple wing
to aid the zephyr in their tuneful toil;
while other check each rude gale,
expel rough Boreas from the sky,
nor let a breeze its heave breath exhale,
save such as soft pant, and pant die.
then, as thy swell accent rise,
fair fancy wake at the sound,
shall paint bright vision on her rapture eye,
and waft her spirit to enchant ground,
to myrtle grove, elysian green,
amid which some favourite youth shall rove,
shall meet, shall lead she through the glitter scene,
and all be music, ecstasy, and love.
