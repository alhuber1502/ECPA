inscription near a sheep-cote.

1745. 

by the same.

shepherd, will thou here obtain
pleasure unalloyed with pain?
joy that suit the rural sphere?
gentle shepherd! lend a ear.

learn to relish calm delight,
verdant vale, and fountain bright;
tree that nod on slope hill,
cave that echo tinkle rill.

if thou can not charm disclose
in the simple bud that blow;
go, forsake thy plain and fold,
join the crowd, and toil for gold.

tranquil pleasure never cloy;
banish each tumultuous joy:
all but love — for love inspire
fond wish, fierce fire.

love and all its joy be thy —
yet, ere thou the reins resign,
hear what reason seem to say,
hear attentive, and obey.

"crimson leave the rose adorn,
"but beneath they lurk a thorn:
"fair and flowery be the brake,
"yet it hide the vengeful snake.

"think not she, who empty pride
"dare the fleecy garb deride;
"think not she who, light and vain,
"scorn the sheep, can love the swain.

"artless deed and simple dress,
"mark the choose shepherdess;
"thought by decency control,
"well conceive, and free tell.

"sense that shun each conscious air,
"wit that fall ere well aware;
"generous pity, prone to sigh
"if her kid or lambkin die.

"let not lucre, let not pride
"draw thou from such charm aside;
"have not those their proper sphere?
"gentle passion triumph here.

"see, to sweeten thy repose,
"the blossom bud, the fountain flow;
"lo! to crown thy healthful board,
"all that milk and fruit afford.

"seek no more — the rest be vain:
"pleasure end soon in pain:
"anguish light gild over:
"close thy wish, and seek no more. "
