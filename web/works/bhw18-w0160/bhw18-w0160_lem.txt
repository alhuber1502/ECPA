a american tale.

 "ah! pity all the pang i feel,
 if pity ever you know; —
 a age father wound to heal,
 through scene of death i fly. 

 "perhaps my hasten step be vain,
 perhaps the warrior die! —
 yet let i soothe each part pain —
 yet lead i where he lie." 

thus to the listen band she call,
 nor fruitless her desire,
 they lead she, pant, to the wall
 that hold her captive sire. 

 "and be a daughter come to bless
 these age eye once more? 
thy father pain will now be less —
 his pain will now be over!" 

 "my father! by this wane lamp
 thy form i faint trace: —
 yet sure thy brow be cold and damp,
 and pail thy honour face! 

 "in vain thy wretched child be come,
 she come too late to save! 
and only now can share thy doom,
 and share thy peaceful grave!" 

soft, as amid the lunar beam
 the fall shadow bend,
 upon the bosom of the stream,
 so soft her tear descend. 

 "those tear a father ill can bear,
 he live, my child, for thou! 
a gentle youth, with pity care,
 have lend his aid to i. 

 "bear in the western world, his hand
 maintain its hostile cause,
 and fierce against britannia band
 his err sword he draw;

 "yet feel the captive briton woe;
 for his ennoble mind
 forget the name of britain foe,
 in love of human kind! 

 "yet know, my child, a dear tie
 have link his heart to i:
 he mourn with friendship holy sigh,
 the youth belove of thy! 

 "but hark! his welcome foot be near —
 thy rise grief suppress:
 by darkness veil, he hasten here
 to comfort and to bless." 

 "stranger! for that dear father sake,"
 she cry, in accent mild,
 "who live by thy kind pity, take
 the blessing of his child! 

 "o, if in heaven, my Edward breast
 this deed of mercy know,
 that give my torture bosom rest,
 he sure will bless thou too! 

 "ah, tell i where my lover fall? 
the fatal scene recall;
 his last, dear accent, stranger, tell,
 o, haste and tell i all! 

 "say, if he give to love the sigh,
 that set his spirit free? 
say, do he raise his close eye,
 as if it seek for i?" 

 "ask not," her father cry, "to know
 what, know, be add pain;
 nor think, my child, the tale of woe
 thy softness can sustain." 

 "though every joy with EDWARD flee,
 when Edward friend be near
 it soothe my break heart," she say,
 "to tell those joy be dear. 

 "the western ocean roll in vain
 its part wave between,
 my EDWARD brave the dangerous main,
 and bless our native scene. 

 "soft Isis hear his artless tale,
 ah, stream for ever dear! 
who water, as they pass the vale,
 receive a lover tear. 

 "how can a heart that virtue love,
 (and sure that heart be mine)
 lament youth! behold unmoved,
 the virtue that be thy? 

 "calm, as the surface of the lake,
 when all the wind be still;
 mild, as the beam of morning break,
 when first they light the hill;

 "so calm be his unruffled soul,
 where no rude passion strive;
 so mild his soothe accent steal,
 upon the ear of love. 

 "where be the dear illusion flee
 which soothe my former hour? 
where be the path that fancy spread,
 ah, vain spread with flower? 

 "i hear the battle fearful sound,
 they seem my lover knell —
 i hear that, pierce with ghastly wound,
 my venturous lover fall! —

 "my sorrow shall with life endure,
 for he i love be go;
 but something tell my heart, that sure
 my life will not be long." 

 "my pant soul can bear no more,"
 the youth impatient cry;
 "it be EDWARD bid thy grief be over,
 my love! my destine bride! 

 "the life which heaven preserve, how bless,
 how fond prize by i! 
since dear to my Amelia breast,
 since value still by thou! 

 "my father see my constant pain
 when thou i leave behind,
 nor long will his power restrain
 the tie my soul will bind. 

 "and soon thy honour sire shall cease
 the captive lot to bear;
 and we, my love, will soothe to peace
 his grief, with filial care. 

 "then come for ever to my soul! 
AMELIA come, and prove
 how calm our blissful year will roll
 along, a life of love!"
