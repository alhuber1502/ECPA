The Wisdom, Foresight, Resolution, and Greatness of Soul that the Brave Lord <span class="hi">Candish</span> so constantly shew'd in the last Parliaments of K. <span class="hi">Charles</span> the Second, will never be forgotten as long as an <span class="hi">Englishman</span> remains alive. Ev'n then when it was esteem'd by some an unpardonable Crime to be thought one, even then Your Grace and that Illustrious Friend, whose Memory shall always be Dear to all the faithful Lovers of their Country, both of You heroically dar'd to appear at the Head of <span class="hi">Englishmen</span> resolv'd to assert their Privileges. He gloriously seal'd the Love of his Country with his Blood; but even after the Loss of the best of Friends, Your Grace persever'd with an undaunted Spirit in the Noble Cause of Liberty. Nor could the just Grief which You paid to his Memory, hinder You from paying that Duty which You ow'd to Your Country, which has always deservedly been Your first Affection. If some other Persons at that time would have entred into the Wisdom<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d70247e1921">[Page v]</span> of both Your Counsels, You your selves had saved us without the Help of the King; Your Noble Friend, as Your Grace's Self, had been one of the living Ornaments of Your delivered Country, and there had been no need of the Revolution, nor perhaps of the long War that succeeded it. It was neither His nor Your Grace's Fault that You were not then sufficiently seconded, and consequently that You did not save these Nations all that Blood and Treasure which the War has cost them. But when afterwards things were brought to that Extremity that a Revolution was absolutely necessary, no Man did more than Your Grace towards the bringing it about, and working our Deliverance that way. Your Grace was then the most Glorious Instrument of establishing the best of Kings upon the Throne of <span class="hi">England,</span> and defending her present Majesty at so dangerous a Juncture as that of the Revolution. She wisely thought that She could have no where recourse to a better Place for Her Safety, than where Your Grace was known to direct by Your Counsels, and to animate by Your Courage the Brave Assertors of Liberty.</p><p id="o5195-s00035">I have a long time design'd to lay something of mine at Your Grace's Feet, that it might live, and grow and flourish under so Illustrious a Patronage. But the Awe that I stood in of the Force of Your Judgment, and the Fineness of Your Discernment, made me wait for this Opportunity: For I know very well, that I either<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d70247e3043">[Page vi]</span> ought never to approach You this way at all or to do it when I can be most secure of my self. And tho what I offer You now is far from meriting so High a Protection, yet I have less Mistrust of it than of any thing I have done in Poetry. Besides, the Design and the Immortal Subject may supply in some measure the Weakness of my Performance: For I am confident that Your Grace will not refuse to grant that Protection to the Vindication of the King's Memory, which the King at Your Grace's Request granted to the Rights and Privileges of every <span class="hi">Englishman. </span>I am,</p><div class="closer">MY LORD,<div class="signed">Your Grace's most Humble; most Dutiful, and most Obedient Servant, John Dennis</div></div></section></div><li><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-3">THE PREFACE.</a></li><div class="collapse" id="collapse-3"><section class="preface" id="index.xml-front.1_div.3"><header><h1><span class="head">THE PREFACE.</span></h1></header><p id="o5195-s00040">THE following Poem was writ without any manner of Design of obliging or offending a Party. For in all my Life-time I never designed either to please or offend any, and was always of Opinion that he who makes his Court to any, is sure to do it to the wrong; for if all Men were for the Publick Good, there never could be any Party, because a Patriot designs the Good of his Country, but one of a Party intends his own.</p><p id="o5195-s00045">THE following Poem was writ with an Intention to do what Service I could to my Country at this Conjuncture; which, as Mr. <span class="hi">Waller,</span> has truly observed, is a Duty incumbent upon the Muses Friend.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d70247e4114">[Page viii]</span><div class="q"><div id="o5195-l00025" class="l">THE Muses Friend unto himself severe,</div><div id="o5195-l00030" class="l">With silent Pity looks on all that err.</div><div id="o5195-l00035" class="l">But if a great, a publick Action shines,</div><div id="o5195-l00040" class="l">That he rewards with his Immortal Lines.</div><div id="o5195-l00045" class="l">Whether it be in Council or in Fight,</div><div id="o5195-l00050" class="l">His Countries Honour is his chief Delight:</div><div id="o5195-l00055" class="l">Praise of great Acts he scatters as a Seed,</div><div id="o5195-l00060" class="l">Which may the like in coming Ages breed.</div></div><p id="o5195-s00050">THIS is certain, that the late King delivered us from a de ¦ plorable State. Now we who were once in a condition to want Deliverer, may hereafter be in such a Condition again; for who has happened may happen. But since, as Mr. <span class="hi">Waller</span> observes most Heroes are incited to the noble Acts they perform by a De ¦ sire of Praise, who will be at the Trouble to save or defend People so ingrateful as to refuse them that?</p><p id="o5195-s00055">I DESIRE that the Reader would take two Cautions along with him: The one that he would not interpret that Love of Libe ¦ ty which will be found in the following Poem, for an Aversion Monarchy; for Liberty is as consistent with the Government<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d70247e4926">[Page ix]</span> of One as with that of a Thousand. The other is, that he would by no means mistake the Reflexions upon the Army which he <span class="hi">Dutch</span> had in 1672. for a Satyr upon the Nation in general. For I have a long time known the <span class="hi">Dutch</span> to be a Vaiant, a Wise and a Great People, and their Country to be one of the strongest Bulwarks of the Liberties of <span class="hi">Europe. </span></p><p id="o5195-s00060">IF any one happens to wonder that I have employed so many Verses in describing the Battel of <span class="hi">Seneffe,</span> without dwelling afterwards upon any other of the Glorious Actions of the King, as the Battel of <span class="hi">Mons,</span> or that of the <span class="hi">Boyn,</span> or the Siege of <span class="hi">Namur:</span> I desire him to consider that in Descriptions of all Fights, there is something resembling; and by consequence, that one such Description for so short a work is enough; and that from among all the Actions of the King I chose the Battel of <span class="hi">Seneffe,</span> because of the Brave Army opposed to Him, and the Great Prince of <span class="hi">Conde</span> who headed them; and because it is the greatest of all the Actions in which the King, or perhaps any other Captain ever has been engaged; and above all, because the Success of the Allies was undeniably due to the King's Valour and Conduct.</p><p id="o5195-s00065">THE following Poem was writ with a Design of showing the King and not my self, and written in the Language not of the Head but the Heart. 'Tis written in Blank Verse, and not in Ryme, not only because I thought that the former would<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d70247e6111">[Page x]</span> give me the more Liberty, but for several other Reasons which will offer themselves immediately to all who are Judges of Poetry, and which signify nothing to the rest. I will only put the Reader in mind that Mr. <span class="hi">Milton</span> looked upon Ryme as a Bondage, and my Lord <span class="hi">Roscommon</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> as a Barbarity. Mr. <span class="hi">Milton</span> tells us in his Preface to <span class="hi">Paradise lost,</span> that Ryme is trivial to Judicious Ears, and of no true Musical Delight; and Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> in his Verses before the Essay upon translated Verse, that Poetry flourished in <span class="hi">Greece</span> and <span class="hi">Rome,</span></p><div class="q"><div id="o5195-l00065" class="l">Till barbarous Nations and more barbarous Times,</div><div id="o5195-l00070" class="l">Debas'd the Majesty of Verse to Rymes.</div></div><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> threw it off in Dramatick Poetry, as Mr. <span class="hi">Milton</span> had done in Heroick, and as my Lord <span class="hi">Roscommon</span> would have done, if he had lived to write any more; of which the following Lines in the Essay upon translated Verse, may be sufficient to satisfy us.</p><div id="o5195-s00070" class="lg"><div id="o5195-l00075" class="l">OF many Faults Ryme is perhaps the Cause,</div><div id="o5195-l00080" class="l">Too true to Ryme we slight more useful Laws;</div><div id="o5195-l00085" class="l">For that in <span class="hi">Greece</span> or <span class="hi">Rome</span> was never known,</div><div id="o5195-l00090" class="l">Till by <span class="hi">Barbarian</span> Deluges o'erflown,</div><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d70247e6967">[Page xi]</span><div id="o5195-l00095" class="l">Subdu'd, undone, they did at last obey,</div><div id="o5195-l00100" class="l">And change their own for their Invaders Way.</div></div><div id="o5195-s00075" class="lg"><div id="o5195-l00105" class="l">I GRANT that from some Mossy Idol Oak,</div><div id="o5195-l00110" class="l">In double Rymes our <span class="hi">Thor</span> and <span class="hi">Woden</span> spoke;</div><div id="o5195-l00115" class="l">And by Succession of unlearned Times,</div><div id="o5195-l00120" class="l">As Bards began, so Monks rung on the Chimes.</div></div><div id="o5195-s00080" class="lg"><div id="o5195-l00125" class="l">BUT now that <span class="hi">Phoebus</span> and the Sacred Nine,</div><div id="o5195-l00130" class="l">With all their Beams on our blest Island shine;</div><div id="o5195-l00135" class="l">Why should not we their antient Rites restore,</div><div id="o5195-l00140" class="l">And be what <span class="hi">Rome</span> or <span class="hi">Athens</span> were before?</div></div><div id="o5195-s00085" class="lg"><div id="o5195-l00145" class="l">O MAY I live to Hail the Glorious Day,</div><div id="o5195-l00150" class="l">And sing loud <span class="hi">Peans</span> thro the crouded Way,</div><div id="o5195-l00155" class="l">When in Triumphant State the <span class="hi">British</span> Muse,</div><div id="o5195-l00160" class="l">True to herself, shall barbarous Aid refuse,</div><div id="o5195-l00165" class="l">And in the <span class="hi">Roman</span> Majesty appear,</div><div id="o5195-l00170" class="l">Which none no better, and none come so near.</div></div><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d70247e7522">[Page xii]</span><p id="o5195-s00090">FROM what has been said it is plain, that three of our Poets, who have been deservedly celebrated for the Fineness of their Ears, have condemned and exploded Ryme, not only as an Enemy to Art, and a Clog to Genius, and a Debaser of the Majesty of Verse; but as a thing of barbarous Sound, and contrary to true Musical Delight. And I am confident, that those three Gentlemen, if they had been alive, would have been pleased to have seen in the following Poem, an attempt to second that generous Design, which the first of them began, and which the two others approved of; a Design to shake off a barbarous Custom, and to shew the Harmony of our Mother Tongue (contrary to Vulgar received Opinion) above that of our Neighbours the <span class="hi">French,</span> which is utterly incapable of producing any thing like Poetical Musick without the assistance of Ryme.</p></section></div><li id="o5195-w0010" style="text-indent:0;"><a href="/works/o5195-w0010.shtml"><em>The MONUMENT: A POEM Sacred to the IMMORTAL MEMORY OF William the Third.</em></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-xs-6" style="right:0;"><script>
