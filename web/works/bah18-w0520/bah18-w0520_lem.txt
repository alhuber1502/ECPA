song.

the fatal moment i behold
 those eye so fond fix on i,
 some magic sure my heart compel
 to place its dear hope on thou. 
and my true faith can alter never,
 though thou be go perhaps for ever. 

nor danger past, nor woe to come,
 thy image from my soul can part,
 through year of anguish to the tomb
 it will follow this devote heart;
 and my true faith can alter never,
 though thou be go perhaps for ever.
