SONG.

THE fatal moment I beheld
 Those eyes so fondly fix'd on me,
 Some magic sure my heart compell'd
 To place its dearest hopes on thee. 
And my true faith can alter never,
 Though thou art gone perhaps for ever. 

Nor dangers past, nor woes to come,
 Thy image from my soul can part,
 Through years of anguish to the tomb
 'Twill follow this devoted heart;
 And my true faith can alter never,
 Though thou art gone perhaps for ever.
