TO AN UNBORN INFANT.

Be still, sweet babe, no harm shall reach thee,
 Nor hurt thy yet unfinish'd form;
 Thy mother's frame shall safely guard thee
 From this bleak, this beating storm. 

Promis'd hope! expected treasure! 
Oh! how welcome to there arms! 
Feeble, yet they'll fondly clasp thee,
 Shield thee from the least alarms. 

Lov'd already, little blessing,
 Kindly cherish'd, tho' unknown,
 Fancy forms thee sweet and lovely,
 Emblem of the rose unblown:

Though thy father is imprison'd,
 Wrong'd, forgotten, robb'd of right,
 I'll repress the rising anguish,
 Till thine eyes behold the light. 

Start not, babe! the hour approaches
 That presents the gift of life;
 Soon, too soon thoul't taste of sorrow
 In these realms of care and strife:

Share not thou a mother's feelings,
 Hope vouchsafes a pitying ray;
 Tho' a gloom obscures the morning,
 Bright may shine the rising day,

Live, sweet babe, to bless thy father,
 When thy mother slumbers low;
 Softly lisp her name that lov'd him,
 Thro' a world of varied woe. 

Learn, my child, the mournful story
 Of thy suffering mother's life;
 Let thy father not forget her
 In a future happier wife. 

Babe of fondest expectation,
 Watch his wishes in his face;
 What pleas'd in me, mayst thou inherit,
 And supply my vacant place. 

Whisper all the anguish'd moments
 That have wrung this anxious breast,
 Say, I liv'd to give thee being,
 And retir'd to endless rest.
