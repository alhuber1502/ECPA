old Harry return. 

the war be all over and my Harry at home,
 what else can i want now i have get he again! 
yet i kenna how it be, for i laugh and i cry,
 and i sigh, and i sab, yet it must be for joy;
 my harry he smile, and he wipe off the tear,
 and i be doubtful again gin it can be he be here,
 till he take wee bit Janet to sit on his knee,
 and ca's she his dawty, for oh! she be like i. 

then the neighbour come in and they welcome he home,
 and i fa' a greeting, though much i think shame;
 then i steal be the house while they talk of the war,
 for i turn cauld as death when he show they a scar. 
they tell of one Elliot, and brave he must be,
 but i ken a poor soldier as brave yet as he;
 for when that the Spaniard be wreck on the tide â€”
 "they be soldier, my lad, let we save they," he cry. 

the neighbour be gane, and the bairn on his knee,
 he fetch a long sigh, and he look sore at i;
 poor woman, quo' he, you will have muckle to do
 to get bread to yourself, and their wee bit thing too! 
it be true, my dear harry, i toil verra hard,
 send Elspa to service, and jockey to herd;
 for i know unca well it be a old soldier pride
 aye to take from his king, but from no one beside! 

then guide you my pension, quo' harry, my life,
 among all the king troop who can match i a wife;
 when young she be handsome, they envy i sore,
 but now when she be old they may envy i more! 
what be all the wide world to the joy of the heart? 
what be riches and splendour to those that must part? 
and may i this moment a emperor be,
 i will thraw down the crown gin it keep i from thou!
