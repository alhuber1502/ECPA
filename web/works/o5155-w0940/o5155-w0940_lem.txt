on a root-house.

here in cool grot, and mossy cell,
we rural say and fairy dwell:
though rare see by mortal eye,
when the pale moon, ascend high,
dart through yonder lime her quiver beam,
we frisk it near these crystal stream.

her beam, reflect from the wave,
afford the light our revel crave;
the turf, with daisy broider over,
exceed, we wot, the parian floor;
nor yet for artful strain we call,
but listen to the water fall.

will you then taste our tranquil scene.
be sure your bosom be serene;
devoid of hate, devoid of strife,
devoid of all that poison life;
and much it avail you, in their place,
to graft the love of human race.

and tread with awe these favour bower,
nor wound the shrub nor bruise the flower;
so may your path with sweet abound!
so may your couch with rest be crown!
but harm betide the wayward swain,
who dare our hallow haunt profane!
