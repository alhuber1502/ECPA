THE MEETING.

IF I hae been a week away,
 My Jenny rins to meet me;
 Wi' aw the chat o' this bit pleace
 My Jenny's fain to treat me: —
 "There's Rob has married Mary Gray,
 And Bella's past aw tellin! 
And Greace has fun the little cat,
 And Dick can say his spellin. 

Peer Dick has broken deddy's dish,
 And durstn't come to meet ye;
 But he has sent ye this bit cake,
 He thought that he mud treat ye. 
Our butter tells to fourteen pun;
 Our cheese hes fill'd the rimmer;
 And uncle Megs hes sent us beef
 Will sarra us aw at dinner. 

And uncle Megs hes heard frae Gworge;
 He's gane to — I've forgittin;
 But it's some hard-word pleace owre seas,
 I'll hae the neame on't written;
 I think they caw'd it Jemmycaw,
 Or else it is St Christit;
 And if it isn't yen o' they,
 I' faikins, I hae mist it! 

And peer auld Wully's telt his teale;
 He'll never tell anudder! 
And they've been up wi' uncle Megs,
 To wreyte it till his brudder:
 For he was varra nwotishin
 Of ought that Wully wanted;
 And mony time wad wreyte and tell
 They wadn't see him scanted. 

They brought him varra canny up, —
 He had the best o' linnen,
 And keept it just to mense his death, —
 'Twas peer auld Marget's spinnin. 
The house, and aw the bits o' things,
 Will just be for the brudder;
 I only wish he'd meade tem owre
 To Mary and her mudder! "
