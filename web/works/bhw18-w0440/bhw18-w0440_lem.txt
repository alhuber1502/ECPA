to JAMES Forbes, ESQ.

author of “the oriental memoir,” who ask for some line of my handwriting on leave FRANCE, after his captivity at Verdun. 

when sever from this hostile shore,
 a weary captive now no more,
 home, cherish home, shall glad your sight
 in blessedness of fresh delight;
 while love shall weave new spell around
 that spot of consecrate ground,
 where sweet domestic joy impart
 the charm that bind congenial heart,
 and filial tenderness prepare
 a balm for all terrestrial care: —
 forget not, — ah, forget not those
 who seek to soothe the captive woe! 
exult, be happy, and be free,
 but give one pensive thought to i!
