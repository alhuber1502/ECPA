TO-MORROW.

By the Same.

Pereunt et Imputantur.

TO-morrow, didst thou say!
Methought I heard Horatio say, To-morrow.
Go to — I will not hear of it — To-morrow!
'Tis a sharper, who stakes his penury
Against thy plenty — who takes thy ready cash,
And pays thee nought but wishes, hopes, and promises,
The currency of ideots. — Injurious bankrupt,
That gulls the easy creditor! — To-morrow!
It is a period no where to be found
In all the hoary registers of Time,
Unless perchance in the fool's calendar.
Wisdom disclaims the word, nor holds society
With those who own it. No, my Horatio,
'Tis Fancy's child, and Folly is its father;
Wrought of such stuff as dreams are; and baseless
As the fantastic visions of the evening.

But soft, my friend — arrest the present moments;
For be assur'd, they all are arrant tell-tales;
And tho' their flight be silent, and their path
Trackless, as the wing'd couriers of the air,
They post to heav'n, and there record thy folly.
Because, tho' station'd on th' important watch,
Thou, like a sleeping, faithless centinel,
Didst let them pass unnotic'd, unimprov'd.
And know, for that thou slumber'dst on the guard,
Thou shalt be made to answer at the bar
For ev'ry fugitive: and when thou thus
Shalt stand impleaded at the high tribunal
Of hood-wink'd Justice, who shall tell thy audit!

Then stay the present instant, dear Horatio;
Imprint the marks of wisdom on its wings.
'Tis of more worth than kingdoms! far more precious
Than all the crimson treasures of life's fortune.
Oh! let it not elude thy grasp, but like
The good old patriarch upon record,
Hold the fleet angel-fast, until he bless thee.
