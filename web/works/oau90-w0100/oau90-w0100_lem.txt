to Cynthia.

i 

if beauty by enjoyment can
reward a love that be true,
to bless our patience or our pain,
all i deserve from you.

ii.

but oh, to love too well' a curse
of such a strange degree,
be my fidelity far worse
much happy shall i be.

iii.

sad recompense, relentless fate
to faithful love do give;
you be please in be obstinate,
while i in torture live.

iii.

like wretch gull to foreign shore,
i cruel be serve,
instead of love dear promise store
be make a slave and starve
