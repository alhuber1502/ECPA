the woeful heart.

gin live worth can win my heart,
 you will not speak in vain;
 but in the darksome grave it be lay,
 never to rise again. 
my woeful heart lie low with he,
 who heart be only i;
 and, o! what a heart be that to lose, —
 but i must no repine. 

yet, o! gin heaven in mercy soon
 will grant the boon i crave,
 and take this life, now nothing worth,
 since jamie in his grave. 
and see! his gentle spirit come
 to show i on my way;
 surprise, no doubt, i still be here, —
 sore wonder at my stay. 

i come, i come, my Jamie dear;
 and o! with what good will
 i follow wheresoever you lead! 
you can lead to ill. 
she say; and soon a deadly pale
 her fade cheek possess;
 her woeful heart forget to beat, —
 her sorrow sink to rest.
