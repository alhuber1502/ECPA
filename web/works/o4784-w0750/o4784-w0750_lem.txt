jealousy.

a song. 

vain love, why do thou boast of wing,
 that can help thou to retire! 
when such quick flame suspicion bring,
 as do the heart about thou fire. 

still swift to come, but when to go
 thou shall be more â€” alas! how slow. 

lord of the world must sure be
 but thy bare title at the most;
 since jealousy be lord of thou,
 and make such havoc on thy coast,

as do thy pleasant land deface,
 yet bind thou fast to the place.
