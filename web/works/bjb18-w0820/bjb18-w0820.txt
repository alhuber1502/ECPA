A SECOND HYMN FOR THE KIRK.

BE Heaven's almighty King adored,
 Of all good things the Giver! 
Sing Halleluja to the Lord
 For ever, and for ever! 

Let closed lips, moved at the word,
 With glowing accents sever! 
O Halleluja to the Lord
 For ever, and for ever! 

Can other strains such sounds afford,
 Of extacy? O never! 
Sing Halleluja to the Lord
 For ever, and for ever!
