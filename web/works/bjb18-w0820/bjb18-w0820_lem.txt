a second hymn for the Kirk.

be heaven almighty king adore,
 of all good thing the giver! 
sing Halleluja to the lord
 for ever, and for ever! 

let close lip, move at the word,
 with glow accent sever! 
o Halleluja to the lord
 for ever, and for ever! 

can other strain such sound afford,
 of ecstasy? o never! 
sing Halleluja to the lord
 for ever, and for ever!
