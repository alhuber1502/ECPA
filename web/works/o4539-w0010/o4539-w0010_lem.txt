[you trueborn Englishman proceed]

1. 

you trueborn Englishman proceed,
our trifle crime detect,
 let the poor starve, religion bleed,
 the dutch be damn, the french succeed,
and all by your neglect.

2. 

your action all the world disgust,
the french be only glad,
 your friend your honesty distrust,
 and while you think you be wise and just,
the nation think you mad.

3. 

be these the way your wisdom take,
to raise our reputation?
to quarrel at a few mistake,
 while France their own advantage make,
and laugh at all the nation.

4. 

you be the people who of old
the nation troop disband,
 and now you shall your friend uphold,
 your friend and you be buy and sell,
as always be intend.

5. 

there be none but fool in time to come,
will trust the english nation;
 for if they do, they know their doom,
 that we will be fall out at home,
and balk their expectation.

6. 

you be the nation grand defence,
against illegal power,
 and yet against both law and sense,
 and sometime too without pretence,
you send folk to the tower. 

7. 

some lord your anger have incur,
for treaty of partition,
 but if you will take the nation word,
 most people think it be absurd,
and empty of discretion.

8. 

for if that treaty as it be fame,
give part of Spain to Gaul,
 why shall those gentleman be blame,
 when you your self be not ashamed,
to let they take it all.

9. 

bribe and ill practice you find,
and some few feel your power,
 but soon you run your self aground,
 for have you push the matter round,
you all have go to the tower. 

10. 

some reformation have from you,
in vain be long expect,
 but when you shall the business do,
 your private quarrel you pursue,
and the nation lie neglelct.

11. 

long have the kingdom bear the weight
of your deficient fund,
 that parliamentary public cheat,
 pray where be the difference of that
and plunder with dragoon?

12. 

be you the people that complain
of arbitrary power?
then show the nation if you can,
 where king have be since king begin,
such tyrant as you be.

13. 

when king with right and law dispense,
and set up power despotic,
 it have be count law and fence
 to take up arm against our prince,
and call in aid exotic.

14. 

but you, although your power depend
on every ploughman vote,
 beyond the law that power extend,
 to ruin those you shall defend,
and sell the power you buy.

15. 

the king religion do commend
to you his law-explainors,
 we know not what you may intend,
 nor how you shall religion mend,
unless you will your manner.

16. 

you be the nation darling son,
the abstract of our mobb,
 for city knight and wealthy clown,
 stock jobber, statesman and buffoon,
you may defy the globe.

17. 

Toland insult the holy ghost,
bribe sir bribe accuse,
 good manner and religion lose,
 the king who be your lord of host,
the raskal h—w abuse.

18. 

your statesman g—lle with intent
to cultivate with care,
 the dignity of parliament
 ply close at the dance tent,
and manage may-fair.

19. 

the trueborn hero diligence
for public good appear,
 there he refine his wit and sense,
 that the next day in our defence
may fill committee chair.

20. 

the limitation of the crown
be your immediate care,
 if your wise article go down,
 your power will be so lawless grow,
it be no matter who be the heir.

21. 

do we for this depose our prince,
and liberty assume,
 that you shall with our law dispense,
 commit mankind without offence,
and govern in his room?

22. 

you shall find out some other word
to give the crown accepter,
 to call he king will be absurd,
 for though he'l seem to wear the sword,
it be you have get the sceptre.

23. 

and now your wrath be smoke hot
against the Kent petition,
 no man alive can tell for what
 but tell truth which please you not,
and tax your discretion.

24. 

if you those gentleman detain
by your unbounded power,
 it be hope you will never more complain
 of bishop in king James reign,
send blind to the tower. 

25. 

a strange memorial too there come,
your member to affront,
 which tell you truth you dare not name,
 and so the paper scape the flame,
or else it have be burn.

26. 

some say the language be severe,
and into passion fly,
 some too begin to curse and swear,
 and call the author mutineere,
but all man say it be true.

27. 

but oh! the consternation now
in which you all appear!
it be plain from whence your terror fly,
 for have your guilt be less you know,
so will have be your fear.

28. 

in fifteen article you be tell
you have our right betray,
 banter the nation, buy and sell
 the liberty you shall uphold;
no wonder you be afraid.

29. 

and now to make your self appear
the more impertinent,
 a wise address you do prepare,
 to have his majesty take care
rebellion to prevent.

30. 

no doubt his majesty will please
to take your cause in hand,
 beside the work be do with ease,
 full seven thousand man he have
the nation to defend.

31. 

one hundred thousand hero more
do our train band compose,
 if foreign force shall come or're,
 plant they and you upon the shore,
how brave you will oppose.

32. 

then blush you senator to see
how all man stand dismay,
 the nation shall so patient be,
 to bear with all your villainy,
and see themselves betray.

33. 

it be our freedom to defend,
that we the people choose you,
 and we the people do pretend
 our power of choose may extend
to punish and depose you.

34. 

for since in vain our hope and fear,
petition too be vain,
 no remedy but this appear,
 to pull the house about your ear,
and send you home again.

35. 

these be the nation discontent,
the cause be too true,
 the ploughman now his choice repent,
 for though he value parliament,
he be out of love with you. 

36. 

when to be choose with cap in hand
you court every voice,
 you be our servant at command,
 by which it seem you understand,
until we make our choice.

37. 

if that be true, we let you know
upon that very score,
 you will best your present hour bestow
 in all the mischief you can do,
for we will never choose you more.
