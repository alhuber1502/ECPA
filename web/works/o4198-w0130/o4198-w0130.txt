SENTIMENT.

1769.

SINCE we can die but once, what matters it,
 If rope or garter, poison, pistol, sword,
 Slow-wasting sickness or the sudden burst
 Of valve arterial in the noble parts,
 Curtail the miseries of human life? 
Tho' varied is the Cause, the Effect's the same;
 All to one common Dissolution tends.
