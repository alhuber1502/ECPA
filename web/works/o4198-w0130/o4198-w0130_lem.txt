sentiment.

1769. 

since we can die but once, what matter it,
 if rope or garter, poison, pistol, sword,
 slow-wasting sickness or the sudden burst
 of valve arterial in the noble part,
 curtail the misery of human life? 
though vary be the cause, the effect the same;
 all to one common dissolution tend.
