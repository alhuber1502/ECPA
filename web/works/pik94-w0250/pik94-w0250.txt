ON A CHILD'S BIRTH DAY.

Smiling blessings, pleasures gay,
 Grace sweet Shirley's natal day,
 Brighten still her opening scene,
 Ever be the day serene! 
May each virtue grace her mind,
 Her temper meek, her sense refined,
 Be her gentle, guiltless breast,
 The fair abode of peace and rest! 
Innocence her steps await,
 And shield her from the storms of fate;
 Virtue be her darling pride,
 And guardian angels be her guide;
 May kind Heaven's protecting power,
 Shield her to her latest hour! 
Deign to aid a parent's care,
 To make her good as she is fair! 
And may sweet Shirley still inherit,
 Her mother's virtues, father's spirit!
