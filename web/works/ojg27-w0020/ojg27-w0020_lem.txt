fable [01] i 

the lion, the tiger, and the traveller.

accept, young prince, the moral lay,
 and in these tale mankind survey;
 with early virtue plant your breast,
 the specious art of vice detest. 

prince, like beauty, from their youth
 be stranger to the voice of truth:
 learn to contemn all praise betimes;
 for flattery the nurse of crime. 
friendship by sweet reproof be show,
 (a virtue never near a throne;)
 in court such freedom must offend,
 there none presume to be a friend. 
to those of your exalt station
 each courtier be a dedication;
 must i too flatter like the rest,
 and turn my moral to a jest? 
the muse disdain to steal from those,
 who thrive in court by fulsome prose. 

but shall i hide your real praise,
 or tell you what a nation say? 
they in your infant bosom trace
 the virtue of your royal race,
 in the fair dawn of your mind
 discern you generous, mild and kind,
 they see you grieve to hear distress,
 and pant already to redress. 
go on, the height of good attain,
 nor let a nation hope in vain. 
for hence we just may presage
 the virtue of a riper age. 
true courage shall your bosom fire,
 and future action own your sire. 
coward be cruel; but the brave
 love mercy, and delight to save. 

a tiger, roam for his prey,
 spring on a traveler in the way;
 the prostrate game a lion spy,
 and on the greedy tyrant fly:
 with mingle roar resound the wood,
 their tooth, their claw distil with blood,
 until, vanquish by the lyon strength,
 the spot foe extend his length. 
the man beseech the shaggy lord,
 and on his knee for life implore,
 his life the generous hero give. 
together walk to his cave,
 the lion thus bespeak his guest. 

what hardy beast shall dare contest
 my matchless strength? you see the fight,
 and must attest my power and right. 
force to forgo their native home
 my starve slave at distance roam,
 within these wood i reign alone,
 the boundless forest be my own;
 bear, wolf, and all the savage brood
 have die the regal den with blood;
 these carcass on either hand,
 those bone that whiten all the land
 my former deed and triumph tell,
 beneath these jaw what number fall. 

true, say the man, the strength i see
 may well the brutal nation awe;
 but shall a monarch, brave like you,
 place glory in so false a view? 
robber invade their neighbour right. 
be love. let justice bound your might. 
mean be ambitious hero boast
 of waste land and slaughter host;
 pirate their power by murder gain,
 wise king by love and mercy reign;
 to i your clemency have show
 the virtue worthy of a throne;
 heaven give you power above the rest,
 like heaven to succour the distress. 

the case be plain, the monarch say;
 false glory have my youth mislead,
 for beast of prey, a servile train,
 have be the flatterer of my reign. 
you reason well. yet tell i, friend,
 do ever you in court attend? 
for all my fawn rogue agree
 that human hero rule like i.
