Indeed I have no intention to pay your compliments: not that your discernment is so nice as to reject them with indignation; but because it is my sincere opinion that they would do you harm. To entertain agreeable notions of one's own character, is a great incentive to act with propriety and spirit. But I should be sorry to contribute in any degree, to your acquiring an excess of self-sufficiency.</p><p id="o4546-s00040">To talk thus freely, is certainly a proof that I wish<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d46116e705">[Page 3]</span> you well: and I make no doubt, Sir, but you consider me as your very good friend; although some people, — and those too not destitute of wisdom, — will not scruple to insinuate the contrary.</p><p id="o4546-s00045">Be that as it may, give me leave to thank you for your particular kindness to me; and chiefly for the profound respect with which you have always treated me.</p><p id="o4546-s00050">I own indeed, that when I have boasted of a glimpse of regard from the finest eyes, and most amiable heart in the world; or, to display my extensive erudition, have quoted Greek, Latin, and French sentences, one after another with astonishing celerity; or have got into my <span class="hi">Old-hock humour,</span> and fallen a-raving about princes and lords, knights and geniuses, ladies of quality and harpsichords; — you, with a peculiar comic smile, have gently reminded me of the <span class="hi">importance of a man to himself,</span> and slily left the room, with the witty DEAN lying open at ∔ <span class="hi">P. P. clerk of this parish. </span></p><p id="o4546-s00055">The following ODE which courts your acceptance, is on a subject grave and solemn; and therefore may be considered by many people, as not so well suited to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d46116e1407">[Page 4]</span> your volatile disposition. But I, Sir, who enjoy the pleasure of your intimate acquaintance, know that many of your hours of retirement are devoted to thought; and that you can as strongly relish the productions of a serious Muse, as the most brilliant sallies of sportive Fancy.</p><p id="o4546-s00060">As to my merit as a poet, I shall only say, that while I am certain of YOUR approbation, I shall be entirely satisfied: and if I can any how improve the noble feelings of that honest open heart of yours, I shall reckon myself infinitely happy.</p><p id="o4546-s00065">I must now bid you farewell, with an assurance, that while you continue the man that you are, you shall ever find me, with the greatest sincerity and affection,</p><div class="closer">MY DEAR SIR,<div class="signed">Yours, <span class="hi">&amp;c. </span></div></div></section></div><li id="o4546-w0010" style="text-indent:0;"><a href="/works/o4546-w0010.shtml"><em>ODE TO TRAGEDY.</em></a></li></ul></div></div></div></section><script xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
