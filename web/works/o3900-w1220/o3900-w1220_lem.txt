summon my labour to renew,
 and glad to act my part,
 lord, in thy name, my task i do,
 and with a single heart. 

ii.

end of my every action thou! 
thyself in all i see:
 accept my hallow labour now;
 i do it unto thou. 

iii.

whatever the father view as thy,
 he view with gracious eye. 
Jesus! this mean oblation join
 to thy great sacrifice. 

iv.

stamp with a infinite desert
 my work he then shall own;
 well-pleased in i, when mine thou be,
 and i his favourite son!
