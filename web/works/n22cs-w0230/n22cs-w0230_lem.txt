sonnet [23] xxiii. by the same. to the north star. 

to thy bright beam i turn my swim eye,
 fair, favourite planet! which in happy day
 see my young hope, ah! faithless hope! — arise;
 and on my passion shed propitious ray! 
now nightly wander amid the tempest drear
 that howl the wood, and rocky steep among,
 i love to see thy sudden light appear
 through the swift cloud, drive by the wind along:
 or in the turbid water, rude and dark,
 over who wild stream the gust of winter rave,
 thy tremble light with pleasure still i mark,
 gleam in faint radiance on the foam wave! 
so over my soul short ray of reason fly,
 then fade: — and leave i, to despair and die!
