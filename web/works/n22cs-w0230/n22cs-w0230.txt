SONNET [23] XXIII. By the same. To the North Star. 

TO thy bright beams I turn my swimming eyes,
 Fair, fav'rite planet! which in happier days
 Saw my young hopes, ah! faithless hopes! — arise;
 And on my passion shed propitious rays! 
Now nightly wandering mid the tempests drear
 That howl the woods, and rocky steeps among,
 I love to see thy sudden light appear
 Thro' the swift clouds, driv'n by the wind along:
 Or in the turbid water, rude and dark,
 O'er whose wild stream the gust of Winter raves,
 Thy trembling light with pleasure still I mark,
 Gleam in faint radiance on the foaming waves! 
So o'er my soul short rays of reason fly,
 Then fade: — and leave me, to despair and die!
