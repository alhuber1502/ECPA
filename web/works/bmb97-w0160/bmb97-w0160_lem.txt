on the eve of departure from o —

loud beat the rain! the hollow groan
 of rush wind i hear,
 that with a deep and sullen moan,
 pass slow by the ear. 

soon will my die fire refuse
 to yield a cheerful ray,
 yet, shiver still i sit and muse
 the late spark away. 

ah, what a night! the chilly air
 bid comfort hence depart,
 while sad repining clammy wing
 cling icy to my heart. 

tomorrow dawn may fair arise,
 and lovely to the view;
 the sun with radiance gild the sky,
 yet then — i say adieu! 

oh, stay, dear night, with cautious care,
 and linger footstep move,
 though day may be more soft and fair,
 not she, but thou, i love. 

stay, wild in brow, severe in mien,
 stay! and ward off the foe;
 who, unrelenting smile serene,
 yet tell i i must go. 

forsake these hospitable hall,
 where truth and friendship dwell,
 to these high tower and ancient wall,
 pronounce a long farewell. 

alas! will time be rapacious hand,
 these golden day restore? 
or will he suffer i to taste
 these golden day no more? 

will he permit that here again,
 i turn my will foot? 
that my glad eye may here again,
 the look of kindness meet? 

that here i ever may behold,
 felicity to dwell,
 and often have the painful task
 of sigh out farewell? 

ah, be it so! my fear i lose,
 by hope sweet vision feed;
 and as i fly to seek repose,
 she flutter round my bed.
