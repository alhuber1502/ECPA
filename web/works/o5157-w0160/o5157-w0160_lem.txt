to a lady on a landscape of her draw.

by mr. parrat.

behold the magic of theresa hand!
a new creation bloom at her command.
touch into life the vivid colour glow,
catch the warm stream, and quicken as they flow.
the ravish sight the please landscape fill,
here sink the valley, and there rise the hill.
not with more horror nod bleak calpe height,
than here the picture rock astound the sight.
not Thames more devious-winding leave his source,
than here the wander river shape their course.
oblique labour run the gurgle rill;
still murmur run, or seem to murmur still.
a age oak, with hoary moss overspread,
here lift aloft its venerable head;
there overshadow hang a sacred wood,
and nod invert in the neighbour flood.
each tree as in its native forest shoot,
and blush bend with autumn golden fruit.
thy pencil lend the rose a lovely hue,
and give the lily fair to our view.
here fruit and flower adorn the vary year,
and paradise with all its sweet be here.
there stoop to its fall a tower appear,
with tempest shake, and a weight of year.
the daisy meadow, and the woodland green,
in order rise, and fill the various scene.

some part, in light magnificent dress,
obtrusive enter, and stand all confess;
while other decent in shade be throw,
and by conceal make their beauty know.
alternate thus, and mutual be their aid,
the light owe half their lustre to the shade.

so the bright fire that light the milky way,
lose and extinguish in the solar ray;
in the sun absence pour a flood of light,
and borrow all their brightness from the night.

to cheat our eye how well do thou contrive!
each object here seem real and alive.
not more resemble life the figure stand,
form by Lysippus, or by Phidias' hand.
unnumbered beauty in the piece unite;
rush on the eye, and crowd upon the sight.
at once our wonder and delight you raise,
we view with pleasure, and with rapture praise.
