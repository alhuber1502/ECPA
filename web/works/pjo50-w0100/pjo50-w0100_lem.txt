to miss Clayton.

occasion by she break a appointment to visit the author.

now ponder well, miss Clayton dear,
 and read your bible book;
 lest you one day shall rue the time
 that you your promise break. 

it be on that bed where you have lie
 full many a restless night,
 that you do say, nay swear it too —
 but you have forget it quite. 

your tender mother eke also,
 do ratify the same;
 and stroke i over the face, and vow —
 much more than i will name. 

but what be woman oath, and vow,
 with which we make such pother? 
ah, trust we not, you faithful swain! 
who can trust each other. 

the swain may vow eternal love,
 and yet that vow revoke;
 for lover vow alas! be make
 on purpose to be break. 

the courtier break his word, it be true,
 or keep it but in part;
 but you, whenever you break your word,
 perhaps may break a heart. 

the chemist say he will turn to gold
 each thing he light upon;
 and so he will, whenever he find
 the philosophic stone. 

the lawyer say he will get your cause,
 then lose cause, and cost;
 but there be a maxim in the law,
 say, fee must not be lose. 

allegiance firm to gracious king
 swear parson one and all:
 pity! Christ vicar, or of Bray,
 shall ever swear at all. 

physician too can promise fair,
 in figure and in trope —
 then let your faith and fee be great,
 and while there be life, there be hope. 

but when all confidence be lose,
 small comfort hope afford;
 for who hereafter can i trust,
 now you have break your word?
