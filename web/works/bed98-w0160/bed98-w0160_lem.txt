legend.

the long day in night must die,
and winter end the year:
and so to contemplation eye,
must human life appear.

Herman have fourscore winter past,
his late thread be spin:
of many day he live his last,
and view life set sun.

yet ere his spirit take its leave
of all it value here;
one fond embrace he fain will give,
and bless his child dear.

his child dear approach his couch;
my son he faint say,
my heart still rest where i have love much,
and shrink from death with dread.

the part stroke, be death no strife,
it be agony to bear;
from those who give it be joy to life,
and every please care.

yet, ere my late sand be shed,
and while a breath i draw,
may filial duty, from this bed,
retain a father law.

no well fill coffer you will receive,
or aught of wealth or cost,
but ah! a mansion i will give,
which distant realm can boast.

and sure it be my anxious care,
to fit you for the road;
and while i warn the danger there,
the high reward i show.

as through the wilderness no more
a pilot to your youth,
be die word, my live power,
and your support, your truth.

and now they clasp his clammy hand,
bathe they with many a tear,
and vow, his ever love command
be more than life blood dear.

it be well he say, the power be good,
who grant i strength to say,
the holy hermit of the wood,
shall best direct your way.

thus Herman breathe his last adieu,
low in the dust he lie;
and pious prayer and honour due,
before his ash rise.

his child dear, with honour meet,
have mourn the pious dead;
and next the saint sage they greet,
who bless the solemn shade.

hail holy hermit! oft they cry,
thy suppliant be we,
and meek they raise the implore eye,
and low they bend the knee.

oh! mark we out the safe way
to a bright mansion give;
for well thou can, that saint do say,
who spirit rest in heaven.

with pious hand his mortal part,
beneath the green sward lay,
and with the mourning of the heart,
his funeral honour pay.

his die and his strict command,
it be thus we have pursue;
when we implore thy guide hand,
oh hermit of the wood!

the hermit raise they from the ground,
and cheer be his look;
compassion in his face they find,
and in the word he speak.

for well of all the hermit know,
in past nor future scant,
to holy man, it be hold as true,
heaven do such knowledge grant.

far as my faithful word may guide,
the holy hermit say,
my counsel shall not be deny,
to those who seek my aid.

he take they to his simple cell,
of fare he give his best:
bright water from the pure well,
and fruit of dainty taste.

and then around each neck he throw,
a chain of pure gold;
which, to each breast a lock so true,
in form of anchor hold.

though small in size, of countless worth,
three lamp the chain suspend,
and thus the hermit well set forth,
their value and their end.

son of my friend! i hold you dear,
accept these gift of love:
these answer to your prayer appear,
and your true guide shall prove.

and now he take they to the grove,
and show the prospect round:
and point out with parental love,
where the safe path be find.

beyond he say your country lie,
nor rest in aught beneath;
that narrow path command the prize,
which Herman do bequeathe.

though narrow, and too little tread,
these lamp shall guide your foot,
be your conductor through the road,
and find yond bless retreat.

they be not wrought by mortal hand,
observe and mark they well,
these light two different view command,
to lead and to repel.

by each your way be ever know,
though some may seem more fair.
through this be the bright region show,
that crown your course of care.

the last from specious snare shall warn,
still potent to disclose;
although some transient charm adorn,
the depth of hide woe.

i mark impatience in each eye,
thus youth be wont to be;
still ardent unknown scene to try,
ere they their danger see.

yet for a moment i detain,
and further counsel hold;
whatever i give and say be vain,
if aught remain untold.

while mindful of their destine use,
their owner these employ;
as they no mortal can produce,
no mortal can destroy.

but with such sacred art combine,
and so unite glow,
that one neglect still you will find,
shade over the other throw.

well, herman son observe each word,
so speed you in your course,
and may the counsel you have implore,
be your secure resource.

and much he grieve their thoughtless haste,
which scant their thanks can spare;
and fear those counsel must be waste,
which scarce to hear they bear.

till sight can they no more disclose,
the hermit eye pursue;
then care to sooth, with calm repose,
he seek his native wood.

together yet their pilgrim foot,
the bid path pursue;
observe the bond for kindred meet,
and to their faith keep true.

and bitter i trust be rue,
that pride which first begin,
pernicious counsel to intrude,
in herman old son.

this present from our friend, he say,
be make with kind design;
but as i can need its aid,
i think but light of i.

to some it be a potent spell;
the weak be prone to err,
and ignorance, i know it well,
be move by hope and fear.

then this he say, and touch the spring,
to other may have use,
to i, a poor and trifle thing,
my path, i know and choose.

and potent be those word to lose,
the talisman that bind,
the sacred charm around his neck,
that show his safe ground.

ah! charm no more, the anchor fail,
the link desert the chain;
the lamp a last darkness veil,
nor fear or hope remain.

in conscious virtue all elate,
his wisdom be his pride,
he part, as from a vain conceit,
with a unerring guide.

he yet a while the path pursue,
though some appear more fair;
some danger too, he well subdue,
which he encounter there.

such snare and danger yet he try,
as haughty mind can scorn,
but those which be to pride ally,
it ever ill have bear.

as over the youth his gentle nature yearn,
to the first paint then alcestes turn;
observe he say, in herman old hope,
high thought of self, which ill to counsel stoop,
he view the country with familiar air,
as if he deem a guide superfluous there:
yet there be something noble in his mein,
the trait of honour, and a soul within;
but much i fear the legend will disclose,
that airy honour meet with potent foe:
foe, which his lamp have sovereign power to check,
but that you see be fall from his neck;
sovereign by show to the traveller eye,
the high reward of glorious victory;
show the scene that fall virtue wait,
a sovereign warn from its dreadful fate:
dark be the guide and dubious be the way,
its end, you see no glorious prize display;
its dangerous wander, there inspire no dread,
no gulf of fire be see, or horror spread;
but now the legend will those scene relate,
which self-exalted virtue mourn too late:

for now, adapt to his mind,
see lofty hill invite;
he leave the humble vale behind,
to climb the envy height.

vain affection prompt his stay,
with brother once so dear;
vain they point the safe way,
the bliss or danger near.

the apt temptation, strong of power,
a weak defence overthrow;
as break bulwark guard the shore,
when mighty sea oppose.

and now the giddy height he gain,
nor think of gulf below:
but ill the slippery path sustain,
along the mountain brow.

alas, he dream of solid bliss,
and straight be see no more:
it be fear he find a dread abyss.
a deep without a shore.

now to the painting, see he gain the height,
and how his look express his vast delight:
no air more suit, can ambition breathe,
but quite conceal the gulph which yawn beneath:
the gulph which finish his mad career,
and on its brink you see he next appear;
one foot upon the slope surface see,
the next, within the dread abyss must be:
to save a mortal tongue the dreadful tale,
see charity prepare to spread her veil;
the motto there in golden letter read,
judge not of he, but shun the sinner meed.

the second painting now we shall explain,
and to the legend must return again:

he rashness, oft his brother mourn,
and much they doubt his fate;
how sad it be needful aid to scorn,
they fear he find too late.

another error ever meet
our wonder and our blame;
nor think what may our peace defeat,
and blast our virtuous name.

it be ill the second brother cry,
the hermit gift to slight;
to i he add, it be a prize,
view by the please light.

the other be to i no store,
so perish by neglect;
to use it be to keep its power,
so do the sage direct.

ill-fated youth! so say the sage,
and further say most true;
one cloud, do he well presage,
will shade the other view.

distant and faint those prospect rise,
which glory will disclose;
and darkness only meet the eye,
where terror shall oppose.

but yet, a while he safe tread,
charm by a distant good;
nor yet ambition glare mislead,
danger or toil subdue.

but ah! yond flatter scene beware,
yond way so like the true;
that pleasure near entice snare
cheat not the distant view.

whether that road may guide as near,
he say i soon shall learn;
if wrong, when there it shall appear,
it be easy to return.

misguided youth! thy hope be vain,
thy rash resolve i grieve;
for never more shall thou regain,
what thoughtless thou shall leave.

all vain a brother tear may flow,
he think it causeless grief;
his lamp reveal he nought of woe,
nor counsel gain belief.

dread pit, which sedgy verdure over
have specious conceal;
as now the traveller foot explore,
be fatal reveal.

careless of warn, perish he,
who come so near the prize;
then while we pity, let we be
by sad example wise.

and now my youthful friend, alcestes cry,
to the next painting i will lead your eye;
the dull eye may note the temper here,
benevolence be never mark more clear;
this figure, now his lamp delight try,
as if he see some please prospect rise:
what pity that a mind so form for bliss,
our legend say, that happiness can miss;
now be his lamp the object of your sight,
his hand, observe it, cover over one light;
as if some view he dread to receive,
but nought unneedful will the hermit give;
if mercy and reward be all his view,
he find temptation that can those subdue:
alcestes view they with a moment pause,
and to the legend their attention draw:

and now of herman son so love,
the young but remain:
all that obedient to he prove,
or the bright mansion gain.

and well he may obtain the prize,
who mark his guide with care;
and see the blissful prospect rise,
and see the dreadful snare.

and now my friend, alcestes say once more,
the painting let we yet again explore:
one figure still perhaps be unobserved,
and please hope for that we have reserve;
the whole expression of this face you see,
be soften by a sweet humility;
and here the painter, master of his art,
display the very movement of his heart.
revere Alphonso! here thy love be see,
for i thy pencil trace this moral scene;
to these he fix my mind with early care,
and bid i place my guardian safety there;
there, warn to my youth, these scene have bring,
there, lesson to the young my age have teach.

observe this lamp with both its light display,
with care you see this figure seem to tread;
in every wind dreadful gulf be see,
the onward path lead to yond glorious scene.

enough our honour friend! the brother cry,
thy generous purpose we can well apply;
the glow tint speak from that strike scene,
a lesson that shall point thy wish within;
strong but in weakness, in our strength most weak,
our conscious weakness, now these aid will seek;
more diffident our course of virtue run,
and choose the lamp of herman young son.
