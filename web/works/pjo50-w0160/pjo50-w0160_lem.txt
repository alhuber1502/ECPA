on the reasonableness of her come to the Oxford Act.  

beauty, the bounty of indulgent heaven,
 to favour maid of mortal race be give;
 not to retire with to some lonely scene,
 but to shine forth, and to be see of man. 
the sun thus radiant with diffusive light,
 in his own native day appear most bright,
 and leave the moon the empire of the night. 

by his example, Charlot, shine away;
 be thou the goddess, as he be god of day:
 so shall Oxonians own thy sacred power,
 and worship thou, as persian he adore. 

while Danae live immure within her tower,
 none but old Jove confess her gentle power:
 but have the hapless maid dwell always there,
 who can have say she be, or be not fair? 
her charm have be unheard of in the throng;
 nor Horace leave we his immortal song. 

the sea-born goddess, rise from the main,
 unheeded may have dabble there again;
 have not Apelles snatch the faultless dame,
 and make her charm immortal as his fame. 
it be therefore common prudence to appear,
 that some Apelles may record you fair;
 leave future dauber shall the task essay,
 and, like dull r — smear your charm away. 

come then, and leave those unfrequented shade,
 to dirty shepherd, and to homely maid:
 to our athenian theatre repair,
 and let the learn and gay admire thou there. 
inspire, and then reward some generous youth,
 nurse in the arm of science, and of truth:
 for trust i, Charlot, who no flattery mean —
 to be admire, you only need be see.
