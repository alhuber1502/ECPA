a better answer.

i 

dear cloe, how blubber be that pretty face? 
thy cheek all on fire, and thy hair all uncurled:
 prithee quit this caprice; and (as old falstaf say)
 let we even talk a little like folk of this world. 

ii.

how can thou presume, thou have leave to destroy
 the beauty, which Venus but lend to thy keep? 
those look be design to inspire love and joy:
 more ordinary eye may serve people for weep. 

iii.

to be vex at a trifle or two that i write,
 your judgement at once, and my passion you wrong:
 you take that for fact, which will scarce be find wit:
 od life! must one swear to the truth of a song? 

iv.

what i speak, my fair cloe, and what i write, show
 the difference there be betwixt nature and art:
 i court other in verse; but i love thou in prose:
 and they have my whimsy; but thou have my heart. 

v. 

the god of we verse-man (you know child) the sun,
 how after his journey he set up his rest:
 if at morning over earth it be his fancy to run;
 at night he recline on his thetis breast. 

vi.

so when i be weary with wander all day;
 to thou my delight in the evening i come:
 no matter what beauty i see in my way:
 they be but my visit; but thou be my home. 

vii.

then finish, dear cloe, this pastoral war;
 and let we like Horace and Lydia agree:
 for thou be a girl as much bright than she,
 as he be a poet sublime than i.
