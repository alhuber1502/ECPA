lord boyle answer to the forgo verse.

no air of wit, no beauteous grace i boast;
 my charm be native innocence at most. 
alike thy pencil, and thy number charm,
 glad every eye, and every bosom warm. 
mature in year, if ever i chance to tread,
 where vice, triumphant, rear aloft her head,
 even there the path of virtue i will pursue,
 and own my fair and kind director you.
