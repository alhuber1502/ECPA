to the same gentleman.

ah lay this cruel artifice aside,
 this barbarous distance, and affect pride;
 or else resign my heart, which be too great
 for you in this imperious way to treat. 
i know you be gay and charm as the spring,
 and that i never behold a lovely thing,
 but know as well the influence of my eye,
 nor can you think my heart a vulgar prize.
