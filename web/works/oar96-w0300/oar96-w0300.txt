To the same Gentleman.

AH lay this cruel Artifice aside,
 This barbarous distance, and affected Pride;
 Or else resign my heart, which is too great
 For you in this imperious way to treat. 
I know you'r gay and charming as the Spring,
 And that I ne'r beheld a lovelier thing,
 But know as well the influence of my Eyes,
 Nor can you think my heart a vulgar prize.
