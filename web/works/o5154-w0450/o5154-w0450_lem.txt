the pleasure of poetry.

a ode.

by mr. vansittart.

i 

happy the babe who natal hour
the muse propitious deign to grace,
no frown on his soft forehead lowr,
no cry distort his tender face;
but over her child, forget all her pang,
insatiate of her smile, the rapture parent hang.

ii.

let statesman on the sleepless bed
the fate of realm and prince weigh,
while in the agonize head
they form ideal scene of sway;
not long, alas! the fancy charm delight,
but melt, like spectre-form, in silent shade of night.

iii.

you heavy pedant, dull of lore,
nod over the taper livid flame;
you miser, still increase your store;
still tremble at the robber name:
or shudder from the recent dream arise,
while visionary fire glow dreadful to your eye.

iv.

far other joy the muse shower
benignant, on the ache breast,
it be they in the lone, cheerless hour,
to lull the labour heart to rest:
with brighten calm they glad the prospect drear,
and bid each groan subside, and dry up every tear.

v. 

from earthly mist, you gentle nine!
whenever you purge the visual ray,
sudden the landscape fair shine,
and blander smile the face of day:
even Chloe lip with bright vermil glow,
and on her youthful cheek the rose-bud fresh blow.

vi.

when Boreas sound his fierce alarm,
and all the green-clad nymph be flee,
oh! then i lie in fancy arm
on fragrant May delicious bed;
and through the shade, slow-creeping from the dale,
feel on my drowsy face the lily-breathing gale.

vii.

or on the mountain airy height
hear winter call his howl train,
chase by the spring and dryad light,
that now resume their blissful reign:
while smile Flora bind she zephyr brow,
with every various flower that nature lap bestow.

viii.

more potent than the sybil gold
that lead Aeneas' bold emprise,
when you, Calliope, unfold
your laurel branch, each phantom fly!
slow care with heavy wing beat the dull air,
and dread, and pale-eyed grief, and pain and black despair.

ix.

with you elysium happy bower,
the mansion of the glorious dead,
i visit oft, and cull the flower
that rise spontaneous to your tread;
such active virtue warm that pregnant earth,
and heaven with kind hand assist each genial birth.

x. 

here oft i wander through the gloom,
while pendent fruit the leaf among
gleam through the shade with golden bloom,
where lurk along the feather throng,
who note the eternal spring unceasing cheer,
nor leave in mournful silence half the droop year.

xi.

and oft i view along the plain
with slow and solemn step proceed
hero and chief, a awful train,
and high exalt the laureled head;
submiss i honour every sacred name,
deep in the column grave of adamantine fame.

xii.

but cease, my muse, with tender wing
unfledged, etherial flight to dare,
stern Cato bold discourse to sing,
or paint immortal brutus air;
may Britain never the weight of slavery feel,
or bid a Brutus shake for she his crimson steel!

xiii.

lo! yonder negligen lay
fast by the stream empurple side,
where through the thick-entangled shade,
the radiant wave of nectar glide,
each sacred poet strike his tuneful lyre,
and wake the ravish heart, and bid the soul aspire.

xiv.

no more be hear the plaintive strain,
or please melancholy song,
Tibullus here forget his pain,
and join the love-exulting throng;
for Cupid flutter round with golden dart,
and fierce twang his bow at every rebel heart.

XV. 

there stretch at ease Anacreon gay;
and on his melt lesbia breast,
with eye half-raised Catullus lie,
and gaze himself to balmy rest:
while venus self through all the amorous grove
with kiss fresh-distilled supply their constant love.

xvi.

now horace hand the string inspire,
my soul, impatient as he sing,
the muse unconquerable fire,
and heavenly accent seize my tongue;
then lock in admiration sweet i bow,
confess his potent art, nor can forbear aloud. 

xvii.

hail glorious bard! who high command,
a thousand various string obey,
while join and mix to thy hand
at once the bold and tender lay!
nor mighty Homer down Parnassus steep,
roll the full tide of verse so clear, and yet so deep.

xviii.

o can i catch one ray divine
from thy intolerable blaze!
to pour strong lustre on my line,
and my aspire song to raise;
then shall the muse her choice influence shed,
and with eternal wreath entwine my lofty head.

xix.

then will i sing the son of fame,
the immortal chief of ancient age,
or tell of love celestial flame,
or open fair friendship sacred page,
and leave the sullen thought and struggle groan,
to take their watchful stand around the gaudy throne.
