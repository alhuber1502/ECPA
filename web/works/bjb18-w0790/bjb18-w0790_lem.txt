hymn.

what thought come to the christian aid,
 upon a bed of sickness lay,
 while nightly watcher silence keep,
 or close their weary eye to sleep,
 when lamp and faggot waste away,
 as dim dawn approach day? 

 "though here this frame of dust may end,
 my spirit shall to god ascend,
 and, for his sake who die to save
 poor sinner from a hopeless grave,
 with all her sin and fault forgive,
 a peaceful shelter find in heaven;
 a father house, a home of love,
 praise be his name, all praise above! 

who, even in ruin, love we still,
 and will not soul and body kill! 
and bless be his generous son,
 who have for we such mercy win! 
his gospel shed a cheer light
 upon our darkling way, through dreary night. 
a gleam fall from a sever cloud,
 upon the coffin, and the shroud;
 while, high in air, with buoyant swell,
 sound like a friendly call, the pass bell. "
