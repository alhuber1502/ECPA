DITTO.

To a term oft made use of by partners in trade
 Add a pious young damsel for ever a maid,
 With five hundred tackt to a spirituous liquor,
 Which is drank from the cobler quite up to the vicar,
 These, when right put together, will quickly explain
 The name of a thing made to puzzle the brain.
