CLOE JEALOUS.

I.

Forbear to ask Me, why I weep;
 Vext Cloe to her Shepherd said:
 'Tis for my Two poor stragling Sheep
 Perhaps, or for my Squirrel dead. 

II.

For mind I what You late have writ? 
Your subtle Questions, and Replies;
 Emblems, to teach a Female Wit
 The Ways, where changing Cupid flies. 

III.

Your Riddle, purpos'd to rehearse
 The general Pow'r that Beauty has:
 But why did no peculiar Verse
 Describe one Charm of Cloe's Face? 

IV.

The Glass, which was at Venus' Shrine,
 With such Mysterious Sorrow laid:
 The Garland (and You call it Mine)
 Which show'd how Youth and Beauty fade. 

V.

Ten thousand Trifles light as These
 Nor can my Rage, nor Anger move:
 She shou'd be humble, who wou'd please:
 And She must suffer, who can love. 

VI.

When in My Glass I chanc'd to look;
 Of Venus what did I implore? 
That ev'ry Grace which thence I took,
 Shou'd know to charm my Damon more. 

VII.

Reading Thy Verse; who heeds, said I,
 If here or there his Glances flew? 
O free for ever be His Eye,
 Whose Heart to Me is always true. 

VIII.

My Bloom indeed, my little Flow'r
 Of Beauty quickly lost it's Pride:
 For sever'd from it's Native Bow'r,
 It on Thy glowing Bosom dy'd. 

IX.

Yet car'd I not, what might presage
 Or withering Wreath, or fleeting Youth:
 Love I esteem'd more strong than Age,
 And Time less permanent than Truth. 

X.

Why then I weep, forbear to know:
 Fall uncontroll'd my Tears, and free:
 O Damon, 'tis the only Woe,
 I ever yet conceal'd from Thee. 

XI.

The secret Wound with which I bleed
 Shall lie wrapt up, ev'n in my Herse:
 But on my Tomb-stone Thou shalt read
 My Answer to Thy dubious Verse.
