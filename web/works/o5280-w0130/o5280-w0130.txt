TO MIRANDA.

LOVE's gay Queen, who reigns on earth,
 Smil'd, Miranda, at thy birth;
 Pleas'd, she bid thy angel face
 Beam with each bewitching grace;
 Round your waist her zone she threw,
 Charms divine thus giving you;
 Cupid knelt, and, lowting low,
 To your sway resign'd his bow;
 Jove, who saw the temple fair,
 Thron'd each human virtue there;
 Pallas then, the work to crown,
 Made her Aegis all your own.
