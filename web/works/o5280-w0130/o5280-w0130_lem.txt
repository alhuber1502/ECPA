to Miranda.

love gay queen, who reign on earth,
 smile, Miranda, at thy birth;
 please, she bid thy angel face
 beam with each bewitch grace;
 round your waist her zone she throw,
 charm divine thus give you;
 Cupid kneel, and, lout low,
 to your sway resign his bow;
 Jove, who see the temple fair,
 throne each human virtue there;
 Pallas then, the work to crown,
 make she aegis all your own.
