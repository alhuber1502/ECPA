a song.

i 

force by a cruel lawless fate,
i love a nymph with passion,
but find alas, i come too late
to sway her inclination;
her heart be give a coxcomb fee,
who face have introduce he,
though not one grain of sense have he,
to know how well she use he.

ii.

i try if worth can make her kind,
and hourly make advance;
but who can ever the charm unbind,
in women stubborn fancy:
i calm do she foible show,
where ever he come, abuse he:
i call he fool, i prove he so,
yet she the better use he.

iii.

i hate, she cry, your god of wit,
our sex shall all oppose he;
it be he that charm my appetite,
shall sleep upon my bosom:
this senseless stuff my love withdraw,
and cure my melancholy;
i kick she brute, then bid adieu
to every female folly.
