fable [33] xxxiii.

the courtier and Proteus.

whenever a courtier out of place,
 the country shelter his disgrace;
 where, doom to exercise and health,
 his house and garden own his wealth. 
he build new scheme, in hope to gain
 the plunder of another reign;
 like philip son will fain be do,
 and sigh for other realm to ruin. 

as one of these (without his wand)
 pensive, along the wind strand
 employ the solitary hour
 in project to regain his power;
 the wave in spread circle run,
 Proteus arise, and thus begin. 

come you from court? for in your mien
 a self-important air be see. 

he frank own his friend have trick he,
 and how he fall his party victim. 

know, say the god, by matchless skill
 i change to every shape at will;
 but yet, i be tell, at court you see
 those who presume to rival i. 

thus say. a snake, with hideous trail,
 Proteus extend his scaly mail. 

know, say the man, though proud in place,
 all courtier be of reptile race. 
like you, they take that dreadful form,
 bask in the sun, and fly the storm;
 with malice hiss, with envy glote,
 and for convenience change their coat,
 with new-got lustre rear their head,
 though on a dunghill bear and breed. 

sudden the god a lion stand,
 he shake his mane, he spurn the sand;
 now a fierce lynx, with fiery glare,
 a wolf, a ass, a fox, a bear. 

have i never live at court, he cry,
 such transformation may surprise;
 but there, in quest of daily game,
 each able courtier act the same. 
wolf, lyon, lynx, while in place,
 their friend and fellow be their chace;
 they play the bear and fox part,
 now rob by force, now steal with art;
 they sometime in the senate bray;
 or, change again to beast of prey,
 down from the lion to the ape,
 practice the fraud of every shape. 

so say. upon the god he fly,
 in cord the struggle captive tie. 

now, Proteus, now (to truth compel)
 speak, and confess thy art excel. 
use strength, surprise, or what you will,
 the courtier find evasion still;
 not to be bind by any tie,
 and never force to leave his lie.
