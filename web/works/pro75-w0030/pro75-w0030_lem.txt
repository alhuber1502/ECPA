a pastoral elegy.

i

you nymph, ah! give ear to my lay,
your pastime i prithe give over,
for Damon the youthful and gay,
be go, â€” and our joy be no more.
that shepherd so blithsome and fair,
who truth be the pride of the plain,
have leave we alas! in despair,
for no such a shepherd remain.

ii

his life be a compound of joy,
pure innocence guide each thought,
no envy his bliss can annoy,
for with virtue his bosom be fraught.
he scorn to deceive or betray,
fair truth ever dwell in his sight,
he always be blithsome and gay,
and to please be his only delight.

iii

in the shade when recline on his crook,
to hear his melodious strain,
my flock i have often forsake,
to wander alone on the plain.
each bird do attend on the spray,
the zepher do play on the tree,
sweet harmony join the soft lay,
and whisper his praise in each breeze.

iv

my lambkin be stray far wide,
the lily recline her fair head,
my crook be with scorn throw aside,
for alas! my sweet shepherd be dead.
i will riffle the jessamin bower,
to deck the green turf on his breast,
with myrtle and sweet scent flower,
my damon cold grave shall be dress.

v

while eglantine shed a perfume,
or peace be pastora desire,
while the cowslip continue to bloom,
or the rose be adorn with a brier.
while the lambkin shall graze on the plain,
or the nightingale warble its lay,
as long as old time shall remain,
his memory never shall decay.

vi

but alas! the love youth be no more,
each stream shall repeat the sad sound,
each shepherd the loss shall deplore,
and his fate through the grove shall resound.
since truth like my damon must yield,
to death, that invincible foe,
you swain, ah! make virtue your shield,
nor tremble to meet the dire blow.
