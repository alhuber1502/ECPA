address to the devil.

o thou, whatever title suit thou! 
old horny, Satan, nick, or clootie,
 who in yond cavern grim and sooty,
 close under hatch,
 spairge about the brunstane cootie,
 to scaud poor wretch! 

hear i, old Hangie, for a wee,
 and let poor, damn body bee;
 i be sure small pleasure it can give,
 even to a devil,
 to skelp and scaud poor dog like i,
 and hear we squeel! 

great be thy power, and great thy fame;
 far ken and note be thy name;
 and though yond lowan heugh' thy home,
 thou travel far;
 and faith! thou' neither lag nor lame,
 nor blate nor scaur. 

whiles, range like a roaran lion,
 for prey, all hole and corner try;
 whiles, on the strong-winged tempest flyin
 Tirlan the kirk;
 whiles, in the human bosom pryin,
 unseen thou lurk. 

i have hear my reverend Graunie say,
 in lonely glen you like to stray;
 or where old, ruin castle, grey,
 nod to the moon,
 you fright the nightly wanderer way,
 with eldritch croon. 

when twilight do my Graunie summon,
 to say her prayer, douse, honest woman! 
Aft' yont the dyke she be hear you bumman,
 with eerie drone;
 or, rustle, through the boortry coman,
 with heavy groan. 

ae dreary, windy, winter night,
 the star shoot down with sklentan light,
 with you, myself, i get a fright,
 ayont the lough;
 you, like a rash-bus, stand in sight,
 with wave sugh. 

the cudgel in my nieve do shake,
 each bristle hair stand like a stake,
 when with a eldritch, stoor quaick, quaick
 among the spring,
 Awa you squatter like a drake,
 on whistle wing,

let warlocks grim, and wither hag,
 tell how with you on ragweed nag,
 they skim the muir and dizzy crag,
 with wicked speed;
 and in kirk-yard renew their league,
 our howcket dead. 

thence, countra wife, with toil and pain,
 may plunge and plunge the kirn in vain;
 for oh! the yellow treasure take. 
by witch skill;
 and dawtet, twal-pint hawkie gane
 as yell' the bill. 

thence, mystic knot make great abuse,
 on young-guidmen, fond, keen and croose;
 when the best wark-lume in the house,
 by cantraip wit,
 be instant make no worth a louse,
 just at the bit. 

when thowe dissolve the snawy hoard,
 and float the jinglan icy board,
 then, water-kelpies haunt the ford,
 by your direction,
 and nighted traveller be allure
 to their destruction. 

and aft your moss-traversing spunky
 decoy the wight that late and drink be:
 the bleezan, curse, mischievous monkey
 delude his eye,
 till in some miry slough he sink be,
 never more to rise. 

when masons mystic word and grip,
 in storm and tempest raise you up,
 some cock or cat, your rage must stop,
 or, strange to tell! 
the young brother you will have whip
 off straught to h — ll. 

Lang since in eden bony yard,
 when youthful lover first be pair,
 and all the soul of love they share,
 the rapture hour,
 sweet on the fragrant, flowery swaird,
 in shady bower. 

then you, you old, snick-drawing dog! 
you cam to paradise incog,
 and play on man a curse brogue,
 (black by your fa' !) 
and gied the infant world a shog,
 'maist ruin all. 

do you mind that day, when in a bizz,
 with reeket dud, and reestet gizz,
 you do present your smoutie phiz,
 among better folk,
 and sklent on the man of uzz,
 your spiteful joke? 

a how you get he in your thrall,
 and brak he out of house and hal',
 while scab and botch do he gall,
 with bitter claw,
 and low his ill-tongued, wicked Scawl
 be warst ava? 

but all your do to rehearse,
 your wily snare and fechtin fierce,
 since that day MICHAEL do you pierce,
 down to this time,
 will have ding all lallan tongue, or erse,
 in prose or rhyme. 

and now, old cloot, i ken you be thinkan,
 a certain bardie rantin, drink,
 some luckless hour will send he linkan,
 to your black pit;
 but faith! he will turn a corner jinkan,
 and cheat you yet. 

but fare-you-weel, old nickie-ben! 
o will have you take a thought and men'! 
you aiblin might — i do ken —
 still have a stake —
 I be uvae to think upon yond den,
 even for your sake!
