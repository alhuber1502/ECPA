to Ethelinda, on her do my verse the honour of wear they in her bosom.

write at thirteen.

i 

happy verse! that be press
 in fair ethelinda breast! 
happy muse, that do embrace
 the sweet, the heavenly-fragrant place! 
tell i, be the omen true,
 shall the bard arrive there too? 

ii.

oft through my eye my soul have fly,
 and wanton on that ivory throne:
 there with ecstatic transport burn,
 and think it be to heaven return. 
tell i, be the omen true,
 shall the body follow too? 

iii.

when first at nature early birth,
 heaven send a man upon the earth,
 even Eden be more fruitful find,
 when Adam come to till the ground:
 shall then those breast be fair in vain,
 and only rise to fall again? 

iv.

no, no, fair nymph â€” for no such end
 do heaven to thou its bounty lend;
 that breast be never design by fate,
 for verse, or thing inanimate;
 then throw they from that downy bed,
 and take the poet in their stead.
