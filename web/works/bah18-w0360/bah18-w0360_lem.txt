song.

far from this throb bosom haste,
 you doubt and fear, that lie it waste;
 dear anxious day of please pain
 fly, never to return again. 

but, ah! return you smile hour,
 by careless fancy crown with flower;
 come, fairy joy, and wish gay,
 and dance in sportive round away. 

so shall the moment gay glide
 over vary life tumultuous tide;
 nor sad regret disturb their course,
 to calm oblivion peaceful source.
