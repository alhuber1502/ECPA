a song.

i 

i follow fame and get renown,
i range all over the park and town,
i haunt play, and there grow wise,
observe my own modish vice;
friend and wine i next do try,
yet i find no solid joy,
great pleasure seem too small,
till Sylvia make amends for all.

ii.

but see the state of humane bliss,
how vain our best contentment be,
as of my joy she be the chief,
so be she too my great grief,
fate, that i may be undo,
doom this angel but for one,
and, alas, too plain i see,
that i be not the happy he.
