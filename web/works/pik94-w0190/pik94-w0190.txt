ON THE RIGHT HONORABLE GENERAL C——Y LOSING HIS ELECTION FOR BURY ST. EDMUND'S.

An humble muse presumes thy worth to boast,
 Says D——'s conquer'd, and that C——y lost;
 Still thou dost triumph in the noblest part,
 Still doth preserve the generous patriot's heart;
 Thy principles, great Chief, exalt thy fame,
 And ever shall immortalize thy name;
 For ever lov'd, distinguish'd must thou be,
 For brightest virtues ever shone in thee;
 Thy noble acts are well in Britain known,
 And generous friendship marks thee for her own;
 Then glory, C——y in this seeming fall,
 Thou risest still superior over all:
 The day will dawn when Britain's sons shall see
 Their noblest privileges prized by thee;
 Thou like the sun in yonder western skies,
 Only declin'st, more gloriously to rise.
