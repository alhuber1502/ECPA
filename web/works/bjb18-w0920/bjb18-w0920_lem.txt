select verse from the 147th psalm.

praise you the lord with cheerful voice,
 in swell strain his praise sing,
 it make the grateful heart rejoice,
 it be a bless and pleasant thing. 

he who the break heart do brace,
 and bind up the wound frame,
 number the host through heaven vast space,
 and give to every star its name. 

with fleecy cloud he clothe the sky,
 he store the moisten earth with good,
 from he the raven when they cry,
 and savage beast receive their food. 

he send afar his high behest,
 which sea and land with blessing fill;
 swift fly his word, no power arrest
 the course of his almighty will.
