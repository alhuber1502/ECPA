to mr. HARLEY.

wound by guiscard. 1711.  

i 

in one great now, superior to a age,
 the full extreme of nature force we find:
 how heavenly virtue can exalt; or rage
 infernal, how degrade the human mind. 

ii.

while the fierce monk do at his trial stand;
 he chew revenge, abjure his offence:
 guile in his tongue, and murder in his hand,
 he stab his judge, to prove his innocence. 

iii.

the guilty stroke and torture of the steel
 infix, our dauntless briton scarce perceive:
 the wound his country from his death must feel,
 the patriot view; for those alone he grieve. 

iv.

the barbarous rage that dare attempt thy life,
 Harley, great counsellor, extend thy fame:
 and the sharp point of cruel guiscard knife,
 in brass and marble carve thy deathless name. 

v. 

faithful assertor of thy country be cause,
 Britain with tear shall bath thy glorious wound:
 she for thy safety shall enlarge her law;
 and in her statute shall thy worth be find. 

vi.

yet amid her sigh she triumph, on the hand
 reflect, that diffuse the public woe;
 a stranger to her altar, and her land:
 no son of she can meditate this blow. 

vii.

mean time thy pain be gracious anna care:
 our queen, our saint, with sacrifice breath
 soften thy anguish: in her powerful prayer
 she plead thy service, and forbid thy death. 

viii.

great as thou be, thou can demand no more,
 o breast bewail by earth, preserve by heaven! 
no high can aspire virtue soar:
 enough to thou of grief, and fame be give.
