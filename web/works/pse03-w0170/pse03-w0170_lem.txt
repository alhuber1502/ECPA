a song.

curse on this virtue constancy,
 of which we be vain proud;
 it like a crime do torture i,
 since all my soft thought of bliss,
 and every kind and tender wish,
 be on a careless thankless Swain bestow. 

i with more ease can bear my fate,
 forgive his cruelty,
 if stupid our sex he hate:
 but he do smile on every fair,
 the partial curse i can bear,
 for, oh he be kind! he be kind! to all but i.
