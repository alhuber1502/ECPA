A SONG.

Curse on this Virtue Constancy,
 Of which we're vainly Proud;
 It like a Crime doth Torture me,
 Since all my softer thoughts of Bliss,
 And ev'ry kind and tender Wish,
 Is on a careless thankless Swain bestow'd. 

I with more ease could bear my Fate,
 Forgive his Cruelty,
 If stupidly our Sex he hate:
 But he doth Smile on every Fair,
 The partial Curse I cannot bear,
 For, oh he's kind! he's kind! to all but me.
