occasion by my put a bee out of my window one cold morning in February, at the request of a child. 

ah beauteous stranger! here too soon,
for pity come too late;
grant to fear a coward boon,
and thou resign to fate.

the deed which stop thy honeyed breath,
convey a sting to i;
grieve the fatal gift be death,
which i mean liberty.

nature thy golden plumage dress,
and tune thy simple note;
but yet a niggard of her feast,
my err hand forget.

no vernal robe, or summer sweet,
blossom or plant display;
a herald of the spring to greet,
nor sunbeam cheere thy way.

black eurus chill thy infant wing,
dread waste affright thy eye;
open the vocal choir of spring,
stern winter bid thou die.

ah! what avail a bounteous store,
or what a heart to give;
when the important minute over,
that sufferer may receive?
