To Miss A. H—.

SHort was their stay, of high descent they sprung,
 Two beaut'ous nymphs — and thus they sweetly sung:
 Peace o'er each scene — peace o'er the pleasant fields;
 No shades! to me — more pleasure ever yields. 
O'er all thy minds — the passions calmly flow;
 As Leven's! stream tranquil — to whence we go.
