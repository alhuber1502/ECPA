to Cynthia.

a song.

i 

bear with the vice of my kind
i be inconstant too;
dear Cynthia, can i ramble find
more beauty than in you:

ii.

the roll surge of my blood,
by virtue now ebb low;
shall a new shower increase the flood,
too soon will over flow.

iii.

but frailty when thy face i see,
do modest retire;
uncommon must her grace be,
who look can bound desire.

iv.

not to my virtue, but thy power
this constancy be due,
when change it self can give no more,
it be easy to be true.
