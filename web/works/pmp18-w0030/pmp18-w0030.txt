Picture of Seneca dying in a Bath. By Jordain. At the Right Honorable the Earl of Exeter's at Burleigh-House. 

While cruel Nero only drains
 The moral Spaniard's ebbing Veins,
 By Study worn, and slack with Age;
 How dull, how thoughtless is his Rage! 
Heighten'd Revenge He should have took:
 He should have burnt his Tutor's Book;
 And long have reign'd supream in Vice. 
One nobler Wretch can only rise:
 'Tis He whose Fury shall deface
 The Stoick's Image in this Piece:
 For while unhurt, divine Jordain,
 Thy Work and Seneca's remain:
 He still has Body, still has Soul,
 And lives and speaks, restor'd and whole.
