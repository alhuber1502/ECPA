PSALM CXVII.

I.

YE Nations, who the Globe divide,
 Ye num'rous Nations scatter'd wide,
 To GOD your grateful Voices raise:
 To all his boundless Mercy's shown,
 His Truth to endless Ages known
 Require our endless Love and Praise. 

II.

To Him who reigns enthron'd on high,
 To his dear Son, who deign'd to die
 Our Guilt and Errors to remove;
 To that blest Spirit who Grace imparts,
 Who rules in all Believing Hearts,
 Be ceaseless Glory, Praise and Love!
