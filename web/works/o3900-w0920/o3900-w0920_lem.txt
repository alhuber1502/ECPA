 you numerous nation scatter wide,
 to god your grateful voice raise:
 to all his boundless mercy show,
 his truth to endless age know
 require our endless love and praise.

 to his dear son, who deign to die
 our guilt and error to remove;
 to that bless spirit who grace impart,
 who rule in all believe heart,
 be ceaseless glory, praise and love!
