the ignorance of man.

by JAMES Merrick, m. a. 

behold yond new-born infant, grieve
 with hunger, thirst, and pain;
 that ask to have the want relieve,
 it know not to explain. 

aloud the speechless suppliant cry,
 and utter, as it can,
 the woe that in its bosom rise,
 and speak its nature man. 

that infant, who advance hour
 life various sorrow try,
 (sad proof of sin transmissive power)
 that infant, lord! be i. 

a childhood yet my thought confess,
 though long in year mature;
 unknowing whence i feel distress,
 and where, or what its cure. 

author of good! to thou i turn;
 thy ever wakeful eye
 alone can all my want discern,
 thy hand alone supply. 

o let thy fear within i dwell,
 thy love my footstep guide;
 that love shall vain love expel,
 that fear all fear beside. 

and o! by error force subdue,
 since oft my stubborn will,
 preposterous, shun the latent good,
 and grasp the specious ill;

not to my wish, but to my want,
 do thou thy gift apply:
 unasked, what good thou know, grant;
 what ill, though ask, deny.
