paraphrase on Micha. 6. 6, 7. 

i 

wherewith shall i approach this awful lord,
 what shall i bring,
 what sacrifice
 will not so great a deity despise;
 tell i you lofty spirit that fall down,
 the near to his throne,
 oh tell i how,
 or wherewithal shall i before my own, and your dread maker bow. 
will carmel verdant top afford,
 no equal offer,
 ten thousand ram, a bounteous offer it be,
 when all the flock upon a thousand spacious hill be he,
 will stream of fragrant oil his wrath controul;
 or the more precious flood,
 of my first born blood,
 compound for all my debt and make a full atonement for my soul. 

ii.

if not great god what then do thou require,
 or what will thou deign to accept from i,
 all, that my own thou give i leave to call,
 i will again resign to thou. 
my youth and all its bloom heat,
 my muse and every rapture thought, to thou i dedicate,
 (it be fit the islue of that sacred fire,
 shall to its own celestial orb retire)
 and all my darling vanity,
 for thou i will sacrifice,
 my favourite lust and all,
 among the rest promiscuous shall fall;
 no more that fond belove sin i will spare,
 than the great patriarch will have do his heir,
 and this great god although a worthless prize,
 be a sincere, entire, and early sacrifice.
