a epitaph on king WILLIAM iii. of glorious memory, who die march 8th. 1701. 

i 

beneath these honour of a tomb
 greatness in humble ruin lie:
 (how earth confine in narrow room
 what hero leave below the sky!) 

ii.

preserve, oh venerable pile,
 inviolate thy sacred trust;
 to thy cold arm the british isle
 weep commit her rich dust. 

iii.

you gentle minister of fate
 attend the monarch as he lie,
 and bid the soft slumber wait
 with silken cord to bind his eye. 

iv.

rest his dear sword beneath his head;
 round he his faithful arm shall stand;
 fix his bright ensign on his bed,
 the guard and honour of our land. 

v. 

you sister art of paint and verse,
 place Albion faint by his side,
 her groan arise over the Herse,
 and belgia sink when he die. 

vi.

high over the grave religion set
 in solemn gold: pronounce the ground
 sacred, to bar unhallowed foot,
 and plant her guardian virtue round. 

vii.

fair liberty in sable dress
 write his love name upon his urn,
 WILLIAM, the scourge of tyrant past,
 and awe of prince yet unborn. 

viii.

sweet peace his sacred relic keep
 with olive bloom round her head,
 and stretch her wing across the deep
 to bless the nation with the shade. 

ix.

stand on the pile, immortal fame,
 broad star adorn thy bright robe,
 thy thousand voice sound his name
 in silver accent round the globe. 

x. 

flattery shall faint beneath the sound,
 while hoary truth inspire the song;
 envy grow pale and bite the ground,
 and malice gnaw her forky tongue. 

xi.

night and the grave remove your gloom;
 darkness become the vulgar dead;
 but glory bid the royal tomb
 disdain the horror of a shade,

xii.

glory with all her lamp shall burn,
 and watch the warrior sleep clay,
 till the last trumpet rouse his urn
 to aid the triumph of the day.
