the princess Elizabeth:

a ballad, allude to a story record of she, when she be a prisoner at Woodstock, 1554. 

by the same.

will you hear how once repine
great Eliza captive lay?
each ambitious thought resign,
foe to riches, pomp, and sway?

while the nymph and swain delight
trip around in all their pride;
envy joy by other slight,
thus the royal maiden cry.

breed on plain, or bear in valley,
who will bid those scene adieu?
stranger to the art of malice,
who will ever court pursue?

malice never teach to treasure,
censure never teach to bear:
love be all the shepherd pleasure;
love be all the damsel care.

how can they of humble station
vain blame the power above?
or accuse the dispensation
which allow they all to love?

love like air be wide give;
power nor chance can these restrain;
true, noble gift of heaven!
only pure on the plain!

peer can no such charm discover,
all in star and garter dress,
as, on Sunday, do the lover
with his nosegay on his breast.

pink and rose in profusion,
say to fade when Chloe near;
fop may use the same allusion,
but the shepherd be sincere.

hark to yonder milkmaid sing,
cheerly over the brim pail;
cowslip all around her spring
sweet paint the golden vale.

never yet do courtly maiden
move so sprightly, look so fair;
never breast with jewel load
pour a song so void of care.

will indulgent heaven have grant
i some rural damsel part!
all the empire i have want
then have be my shepherd heart.

then, with he, over hill and mountain,
free from fetter, may i rove:
fearless taste the crystal fountain;
peaceful sleep beneath the grove.

rustic have be more forgive;
partial to my virgin bloom:
none have envy i when live;
none have triumph over my tomb.
