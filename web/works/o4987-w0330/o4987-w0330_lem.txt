a ballad.

by the same.

you shepherd so careless and gay,
 who sport with the nymph of the plain,
 take heed lest you frolic away,
 the peace you can never regain. 
let not folly your bosom annoy;
 and of love, the dear mischief, beware. 
you may think it be all sunshine and joy,
 — i know 'it overshadow with care. 

love morning how blithsome it shine,
 with a aspect deceitful fair;
 its day oft in sorrow decline,
 and it set in the night of despair. 
hope paint the gay scene to the sight,
 while fancy her vision bestow,
 and gild every dream with delight,
 but to wake we to sensible woe. 

how hard be my lot to complain
 of a nymph who i yet must adore,
 though she love not her shepherd again,
 her Damon must love she the more. 
for it be not the pride of her sex,
 that treat his vow with disdain,
 for it be not the pleasure to vex,
 that make she delude her fond swain. 

it be his, the fair nymph to behold,
 he hope — and he rash believe. 
it be she to be fatal cold;
 — he love — and be fond deceive. 
for such be of lover the doom,
 while passion their reason beguile,
 it be warrant enough to presume,
 if they catch but a look or a smile. 

yet sure my Phillis will seem
 to prize i most shepherd above;
 but that may be only esteem,
 while i foolish construe it love. 
yet other, like Damon, believe
 the nymph may have favour her swain,
 and other, like he, be deceive,
 like he, though they can complain. 

of Phyllis be always my song,
 for she be my pride and my care;
 and the folk, as we wander along,
 will call we the conjugal pair. 
they mark how i walk at her side,
 how her hand to my bosom i press,
 each tender endearment i try,
 and i think none be ever so bless. 

but now the delusion be over,
 these day-dream of pleasure be flee,
 now her Damon be please no more,
 and the hope of her shepherd be dead. 
may he that my fair shall obtain,
 may he, as thy Damon, be true;
 or haply thou will think of that swain,
 who bid thou, dear maiden, adieu.
