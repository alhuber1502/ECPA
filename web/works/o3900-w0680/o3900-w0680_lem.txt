act i  4. wait for the promise of the father, which you have hear of i.

i 

Saviour of man, how long shall i
 forget at thy footstool lie! 
wash in the fountain of thy blood,
 yet groan still to be renew;

ii.

a miracle of grace and sin,
 pardon, yet still alas unclean! 
thy righteousness be count i:
 when will it in my nature shine? 

iii.

darksome i still remain and void,
 and painful unlike my god,
 till thou diffuse a bright ray,
 and turn the glimmer into day. 

iv.

why do thou the first gift impart,
 and sprinkle with thy blood my heart,
 but that my sprinkle heart may prove,
 the life and liberty of love? 

v. 

why do thou bid my terror cease,
 and sweet fill my soul with peace,
 but that my peaceful soul may know
 the joy that from believe flow? 

vi.

see then thy ransom servant, see,
 i hunger, lord, i thirst for thou! 
feed i with love, thy spirit give,
 i gasp, in he, in thou to live. 

vii.

the promise comforter impart,
 open the fountain in my heart;
 there let he flow with spring joy,
 and into life eternal rise. 

viii.

there let he ever, ever dwell,
 the pledge, the witness, and the seal;
 i will glory then in sin forgive,
 in Christ my life, my love, my heaven!
