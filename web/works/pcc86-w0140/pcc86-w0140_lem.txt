to lady H—n. 

sweet, gentle mourner, cease thy plaintive note. 
what sympathy? — what gratitude — i feel — i owe:
 how many happy, tranquil day i have pass
 in these gay field, or sweet sequester shade? 
plant by thou — by she the dear friend,
 or by that venerable tower — and ancient pine,
 where mourn the dove;
 or by that sacred isle — where rest the last remains,
 the best of husband. 
flee! from our sight, but in thy soul
 double unite. 
fond recollection of each happy scene. 
how to delineate the indulgent
 father? 
a plain inscription
 suit his truth. 
how anxious to impress it on their tender mind? 
to banish art, deceit, or guile. 
of gentle manner, easy and polite,
 each guest be happy; part with regret. 
home — be the centre of his
 happiness,
 receive his part sigh! bless it;
 and go to heaven. 
hush! to thy grief, thy family claim
 thy care. 
no blast — the tender bud — of hope — shall kill. 
their filial love shall comfort
 thy sad heart. 
the duty! now of both, be leave
 on thou.
