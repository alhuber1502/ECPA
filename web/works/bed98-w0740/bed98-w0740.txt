THE GOODNESS OF GOD.

IMMENSE! eternal, mighty Lord!
Dreadful thou wouldst appear;
Thy power with trembling awe ador'd,
If justice were severe.

But animated goodness beams
On our transported view;
Mild justice fills our grateful themes
With love and wonder too.

Not that thro' ages still the same,
Thy being takes its course;
Not that thy hand thro' nature's frame,
Impels with equal force:

Not that thro' worlds and boundless space,
Is thine immense domain;
Not that thy knowledge all can trace,
And wisdom all ordain:

But that thy goodness shall endure,
Long as thyself shalt last;
That with thy power it rests secure,
Wide as thy reign is placed.

Omniscient to discern the best,
The fittest means to choose;
Of wisdom to contrive possest,
And boundless good diffuse.

With distant awe we view thy power;
Thy wisdom we admire;
But 'tis the goodness we adore,
Must love and hope inspire!
