song.

through springtime walk, with flower perfume,
 i chase a wild capricious fair,
 where hyacinth and jonquil bloom,
 chant gay sonnet through the air:
 hide amid a briary dell,
 or beneath a hawthorn tree,
 her sweet enchantment lead i on,
 and still delude i. 

while summer splendent glory smile
 my ardent love in vain essay,
 i strive to win her heart by wile,
 but still a thousand prank she play;
 still over each sun-burnt furzy hill,
 wild, playful, gay, and free,
 she laugh and scorn, i chase she still,
 and still she banter i. 

when autumn wave her golden ear,
 and waft over fruit her pregnant breath,
 the sprightly lark its pinion rear,
 i chase she over the daisy heath;
 sweet hare-bell tremble in the vale,
 and all around be glee;
 still, wanton as the timid hart,
 she swift fly from i. 

now winter light its cheerful fire,
 while jest with frolic mirth resound,
 and draw the wander beauty nigh,
 it be now too cold to rove around:
 the christmas game, the playful dance,
 incline her heart to glee,
 mutual we glow, and kindle love
 draw every wish to i.
