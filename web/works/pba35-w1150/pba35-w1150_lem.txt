prologue to Theodosius: speak by Athenais at the theatre in Dublin, when lord and lady Carteret be in Ireland.

write by mrs. Grierson.

you look surprise, in this deride age,
 to find that love dare venture on the stage;
 where you, of late seem nothing to approve,
 but what, in man of sense, contempt must move;
 that after all your concert, farce, show,
 you must attend a die lover woe. 

i know you will be amaze at what i mean,
 in all my height of fortune to complain:
 adore by monarch, and a emp'rot bride,
 you will say, i need not in a fret have die. 
forbear; nor witless jest on love employ,
 alike unknowing in its pain and joy:
 when you despise its happiness or woe,
 you but your want of sense, or virtue, show:
 be humane then; be touch with scene refine,
 which, while they raise the passion, mend the mind:
 and, by your pity of my woe to night,
 convince the world, your heart be form aright. 

or, if you scorn to hear what i advise,
 let great example teach you to be wise. 
lover be not so out of fashion here,
 that Athenais blush to appear:
 as fame a pair adorn this isle and age,
 as ever can each other heart engage;
 endow with every grace of form and mind,
 to raise the love and wonder of mankind:
 though bless with every gift to merit fame,
 their high glory be their mutual flame:
 a flame, like that my tender bosom fire;
 but rule by reason, and by heaven inspire:
 their love like i, but different far their fate;
 as happy they, as i unfortunate. 
but my distress have never reach the stage,
 have heaven reserve i to the present age:
 none will have dare my fondness to abuse,
 have i from beauteous Worsley learn to choose;
 nor i my heart on rash Varanes set,
 have i, like she, but know a Carteret.
