on mr. ****, schoolmaster at ***.

by the same.

behold the lordly pedant in his school,
how stern his brow, how absolute his rule!
the tremble boy start at his awful nod;

how fawn, how obsequious, and how tame!
prosper, bright amazon, to thou it be give,
like Juno, to rule he who rule the heaven.
