On Mr. ****, Schoolmaster at ***.

By the Same.

BEHOLD the lordly pedant in his school,
How stern his brow, how absolute his rule!
The trembling boys start at his aweful nod;
Jove's sceptre is less dreaded than his rod.
See him at home before the sovereign dame!
How fawning, how obsequious, and how tame!
Prosper, bright amazon, to thee 'tis given,
Like Juno, to rule him who rules the heaven.
