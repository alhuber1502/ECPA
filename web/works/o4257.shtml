It was indeed <span class="hi">catching the</span> merriment <span class="hi">as it rose;</span> for it was written in the New-market Coffee Room; — In which the Author, being elected a member of the Jockey Club, had the happiness of passing several sprightly goodhumoured Evenings — Just when the whimsical Adventure happened, which is here related.</p><p id="o4257-s00055">POETICAL Licence however (and is it not right that it should be so?) has been taken.

And surely I may be rather excused for making the Press my Amanuensis than the noble Lord, who might have had half a dozen Secretaries at his command. If I have not already said enough, fifty other reasons may be invented by my ingenious Readers.</p><p id="o4257-s00075">AND now for the Critics — Pray, good Gentlemen, be quiet.
