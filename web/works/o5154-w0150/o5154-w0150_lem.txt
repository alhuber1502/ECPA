the beauty.

a epistle to mr. eckardt the painter.

despond artist, talk no more
of beauty of the day of yore,
of goddess renowned in Greece,
and zeuxis composition-piece,
where every nymph that can at most
some single grace or feature boast,
contribute her favourite charm
to perfect the ideal form.
it be cynthia brow, it be lesbia eye,
it be cloe cheeks vermilion dye;
Roxana lend the noble air,
dishevel flow aspasia hair,
and Cupid much too fond press
his mimic mother thais breast.
antiquity, how poor thy use!
a single Venus to produce!
friend eckardt, ancient story quit,
nor mind whatever Pliny write;
felibien and fresnoy declaim,
who talk of raphael matchless fame,
of titian tint, corregio grace,
and carlo each madonna face,
as if no beauty now be make,
but nature have forget her trade.
it be beauty guide raphael line
from heavenly woman, style divine;
they warm old titian fancy too,
and what he can not taste he draw:
think you devotion warm his breast
when Carlo with such look express
his virgin, that her votary feel
emotion â€” not, i be sure, of zeal?

in britain isle observe the fair,
and curious choose your model there;
such pattern as shall raise your name
to rival sweet corregio fame:
each single piece shall be a test,
and zeuxis patchwork be a jest;
who ransack Greece, and cull the age
to bring one goddess on the stage:
on your each canvas we will admire
the charm of the whole heavenly choir.

majestic Juno shall be see
in harvey glorious awful mien.
where Fitzroy move, resplendent fair;
so warm her bloom, sublime her air;
her ebon tress, form to grace,
and heighten while they shade her face:
such troop of martial youth around,
who court the hand that give the wound;
it be Pallas, Pallas stand confess,
though stanhope more than Paris bless.
so CLEVELAND show in warlike pride,
by lilly pencil defy:
so Grafton, matchless dame, command
the fair work of kneller hand:
the blood that warm each amorous court,
in vein as rich still love to sport:
and George age behold restore,
what William boast, Charles adore.

for venus the trojan never
be half so puzzle to declare:
ten queen of beauty, sure i see!
yet sure the true be Emily:
such majesty of youth and air,
yet modest as the village fair:
attract all, indulge none,
her beauty like the glorious sun
throne eminent bright above,
impartial warm the world to love.

in smile capel beauteous look
rich autumn goddess be mistake,
with poppy and with spiky corn,
eckardt, her nutbrown curl adorn;
and by her side, in decent line,
place charm Berkley, Proserpine.
mild as a summer sea, serene,
in dimple beauty next be see,
 Aylesbury like hoary neptune queen.

with she the light-dispensing fair,
who beauty gild the morning air,
and bright as her attendant sun,
the new Aurora, Lyttleton.
such Guido pencil beauty-tipped,
and in ethereal colour dip.
in measure dance to tuneful song
draw the sweet goddess, as along
heaven azure beneath their light foot spread,
the buxom hour she fair lead.
the crescent on her brow display,
in curl of lovely brown inlay,
with every charm to rule the night,
like Dian, Strafford woo the sight;
the easy shape, the pierce eye,
the snowy bosom purity,
the unaffected gentle phrase
of native wit in all she say;
eckardt, for these thy art too faint:
you may admire, but can paint.

how Hebe smile, what bloom divine
on the young goddess love to shine,
from carpenter we guess, or see
all-beauteous manner beam for thou.
how pretty Flora, wanton maid,
by zephyr woo in noontide shade,
with rosy hand coquetly throw
pansy, beneath her sweet touch blow;
how blithe she look let Fanny tell;
let zephyr own if half so well.

another goddess of the year,
fair queen of summer, see, appear;
her auburn lock with fruitage crown,
her pant bosom loose bind,
ethereal beauty in her face,
rather the beauty of her race,
whence every goddess, envy smite,
most own each Stonehouse meet in PITT,

exhaust all the heavenly train,
how many mortal yet remain,
who eye shall try your pencil art,
and in my number claim a part!
our sister muse must describe
 Chudleigh, or name she of the tribe;
and Juliana with the nine
shall aid the melancholy line,
to weep her dear resemblance go,
where all these beauty meet in one.
sad fate of beauty! more i see,
afflict, lovely family!
two beauteous nymph, here, painter, place,
lament over their sister grace;
 one, matronlike, with sober grief,
scarce give her pious sigh relief;
while other lovely maid appear
in all the melt power of tear;
the soft form, the gentle grace,
the sweet harmony of face;
her snowy limb, and artless move
contend with the queen of love,
while bashful beauty shun the prize,
which Emily may yield to evelyn eye.
