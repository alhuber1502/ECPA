love elegy.

by the same.

ah, cruel Delia! must i still remain
 in anxious doubt? will nought your pity move? 
must i still languish? must i still complain? 
still be you deaf to every plea of love? 

a stranger to the odious wile of art,
 the coxcomb chatter, and the beau grimace,
 i speak the honest dictate of my heart,
 nor mask deceit beneath the lover face:

i never boast heap of treasure gold,
 no dirty acre ever be my theme,
 the sordid wretch beneath contempt i hold,
 who dare with love such worthless trifle name. 

and let the fair, who glitter dust delight,
 in lieu of jointure, barter bliss and peace;
 insipid pleasure waste her tedious night,
 and jealous wrangle wear away her day. 

not such the hour, i hope, with you to share;
 not thus to tread the vulgar path of life;
 such base, such brutal joy can never endear,
 can never insure the fond, the tender wife. 

it be then, o then, we feel the enrapture bliss,
 when lose in soft confusion, sweet coy,
 each virgin charm glow with the melt kiss,
 and nature faint beneath the excess of joy. 

though this will cloy, if pleasure more refine
 forbear their influence over the breast to shed;
 virtue alone secure the generous mind;
 she with fresh transport crown the bridal bed. 

if word can tell, let those who heart unite
 in virtuous love, absolve from all controul,
 confess the pleasure, the sublime delight,
 the ecstatic sense of mingle soul with soul.
