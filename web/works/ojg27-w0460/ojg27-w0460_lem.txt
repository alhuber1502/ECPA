fable [45] XLV. 

the poet and the rose.

i hate the man who build his name
 on ruin of another fame. 
thus prude by character overthrow
 imagine that they raise their own;
 thus scribbler, covetous of praise,
 think slander can transplant the bay. 
beauty and bard have equal pride,
 with both all rival be decry. 
who praise lesbia eye and feature,
 must call her sister, awkward creature;
 for the kind flattery sure to charm,
 when we some other nymph disarm. 

as in the cool of early day
 a poet seek the sweet of may,
 the garden be fragrant breath ascend,
 and every stalk with odour bend. 
a rose he pluck, he gaze, admire,
 thus sing as the muse inspire. 

go, rose, my Chloe bosom grace;
 how happy shall i prove,
 may i supply that envy place
 with never-fading love! 
there, Phoenix like, beneath her eye,
 involve in fragrance, burn and die! 

know, hapless flower, that thou shall find
 more fragrant rose there;
 i see thy wither head recline
 with envy and despair! 
one common fate we both must prove;
 you die with envy, i with love. 

spare your comparison, reply
 a angry rose, who grow beside;
 of all mankind you shall not flout we;
 what can a poet do without we! 
in every love-song rose bloom;
 we lend you colour and perfume. 
do it to Chloe charm conduce,
 to find her praise on our abuse? 
must we, to flatter she, be make
 to wither, envy, pine and fade?
