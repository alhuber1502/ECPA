sonnet [17] xvii. from the thirteenth cantata of Metastasio. 

on thy grey bark, in witness of my flame,
 i carve miranda cypher â€” beauteous tree! 
grace with the lovely letter of her name,
 henceforth be sacred to my love and i! 
though the tall elm, the oak and dark pine,
 with broad arm, may noon fierce ardour break,
 to shelter i, and she i love, be thy;
 and thy to see her smile and hear she speak. 
no bird, ill omened, round thy graceful head
 shall clamour harsh, or wave his heavy wing,
 but fern and flower arise beneath thy shade,
 where the wild bee, their lullaby shall sing,
 and in thy bough the murmur ringdove rest;
 and there the nightingale shall build her nest.
