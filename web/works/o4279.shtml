                           </header>
                           <p>THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between
                              the organs of bodily sense and the faculties of moral perception: They have been call'd
                              by a very general name, THE POWERS OF IMAGINATION. Like the external senses, they
                              relate to matter and motion; and at the same time, give the mind ideas analogous to
                              those of moral approbation and dislike. As they are the inlets of some of the most
                              exquisite pleasures we are acquainted with, men of warm and sensible tempers have
                              sought means to recall the delightful perceptions they afford, independent of the
                              objects which originally produc'd them. This gave rise to the imitative or designing
                              arts; some of which, as painting and sculpture, directly copy the external appearances
                              which were admir'd in nature; others, as music and poetry, bring them back to remembrance
                              by signs universally establish'd and understood.
                           </p>
                           <p>But these arts, as they grew more correct and deliberate, were naturally led to extend
                              their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers; especially
                              poetry, which making use of language as the instrument by which it imitates, is consequently
                              become an unlimited representative of every species and mode of being. Yet as their
                              primary intention was only to express the objects of imagination, and as they still
                              abound chiefly in ideas of that class, they of course retain their original character,
                              and all the different pleasures they excite, are term'd, in general, PLEASURES OF
                              IMAGINATION.
                           </p>
                           <p>The Design of the following poem is to give a view of <span class="hi">these,</span> in the largest acceptation of the term; <span class="hi">so that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and
                                 all the various entertainment we meet with either in poetry, painting, music, or any
                                 of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the
                                 constitution of the human mind, which are here establish'd and explain'd. </span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d2482e1737">[Page 6]</span><p>In executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the imagination
                              from our other faculties, and then to characterize those original forms or properties
                              of being about which it is conversant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light
                              is to the eyes, or truth to the understanding. These properties Mr. <span class="hi">Addison</span> had reduc'd to the three general classes of greatness, novelty, and beauty; and into
                              these we may analyse every object, however complex, which, properly speaking, is delightful
                              to the imagination. But such an object may also include many other sources of pleasure,
                              and its beauty, or novelty, or grandeur, will make a stronger impression by reason
                              of this concurrence. Besides this, the imitative arts, especially poetry, owe much
                              of their effect to a <span class="hi">similar</span> exhibition of properties quite <span class="hi">foreign</span> to the imagination; insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems, we meet
                              with either ideas drawn from the external senses, or truths discover'd to the understanding,
                              or illustrations of contrivance and final causes, or above all the rest, with circumstances
                              proper to awaken and ingage the passions. It was therefore necessary to enumerate
                              and exemplify these different species of pleasure; especially that from the passions,
                              which as it is supreme in the noblest works of human genius, so being in some particulars
                              not a little surprizing, gave an opportunity to inliven the didactic turn of the poem,
                              by introducing a piece of machinery to account for the appearance.
                           </p>
                           <p>After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm
                              and interest the mind, a pleasure of a very different nature, that which arises from
                              ridicule, came next to be consider'd. As this is the foundation of the comic manner
                              in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was
                              thought proper to give it a particular illustration, and to distinguish the general
                              sources from which the ridicule of characters is deriv'd. Here too a change of stile
                              became necessary; such a one as might yet be consistent, if possible, with the general
                              taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject: nor is it an easy task to
                              give any tolerable force to images of this kind, without running either into the gigantic
                              expressions of the mock-heroic, or the familiar and pointed raillery of profess'd
                              satire; neither of which would have been proper here.
                           </p>
                           <p>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open, nothing now remain'd but to illustrate
                              some particular pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects
                              one to another, or from the nature of imitation itself. Of the first kind is that
                              various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material
                              and immaterial<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d2482e3776">[Page 7]</span> worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it seems in a great measure
                              to depend on the early associations of our ideas, and as this habit of associating
                              is the source of many pleasures and pains in life, and on that account bears a great
                              share in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mention'd here
                              and its effects describ'd. Then follows a general account of the production of these
                              elegant arts, and the secondary pleasure, as it is call'd, arising from the resemblance
                              of their imitations to the original appearances of nature. After which, the design
                              is clos'd with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination,
                              and on their natural and moral usefulness in life.
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece, little
                              can be said with propriety by the author. He had two models; that antient and simple
                              one of the first <span class="hi">Graecian</span> poets, as it is refin'd by <span class="hi">Virgil</span> in the <span class="hi">Georgics,</span> and the familiar epistolary way of <span class="hi">Horace. </span>This latter has several advantages. It admits of a greater variety of stile; it more
                              readily ingages the generality of readers, as partaking more of the air of conversation;
                              and especially with the assistance of rhyme, leads to a closer and more concise expression.
                              Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets, who has so happily applied
                              this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy, that the public taste is in a great
                              measure form'd to it alone. Yet, after all, the subject before us tending almost constantly
                              to admiration and enthusiasm, seem'd rather to demand a more open, pathetic and figur'd
                              stile. This too appear'd more natural, as the author's aim was not so much to give
                              formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the
                              most ingaging prospects of nature, to enlarge and harmonize the imagination, and by
                              that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to the same dignity of taste in religion,
                              morals, and civil life. 'Tis on this account that he is so careful to point out the
                              benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human constitution
                              here insisted on; and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point
                              of view with the meer external objects of good taste; thus recommending them in common
                              to our natural propenstiy for admiring what is beautiful and lovely. The same views
                              have also led him to introduce some sentiments which may perhaps be look'd upon as
                              not quite direct to the subject; but since they bear an obvious relation to it, the
                              authority of <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> the faultless model of didactic poetry, will best support him in this particular.
                              For the sentiments themselves he makes no apology.
