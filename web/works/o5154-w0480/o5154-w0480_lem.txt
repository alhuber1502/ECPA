song. to Sylvia.

by d. G. 

if truth can fix thy waver heart,
let Damon urge his claim,
he feel the passion void of art,
the pure, the constant flame.

though sigh swain their torment tell,
their sensual love contemn;
they only prize the beauteous shell,
but slight the inward gem.

possession cure the wound heart,
destroy the transient fire;
but when the mind receive the dart,
enjoyment whet desire.

by age your beauty will decay,
your mind improve with year;
as when the blossom fade away,
the ripen fruit appear:

may heaven and Sylvia grant my suit,
and bless the future hour,
that Damon, who can taste the fruit,
may gather every flower!
