the banquet.

dispatch, and to the myrtle grove convey
whatever with the natural palate suit,
the dairy store with salad, root and fruit;
i mean to play the epicure to day!
let nought be want to complete
our bloodless treat;
but bloodless let it be, for i have decree
the grape alone for this repast shall bleed. 
sit worthy friend â€” but ere we feed,
let love b'expel the company;
let no man mirth here interrupt be
with thought of any scornful little she! 
fall too my friend. trust i the cheer be good!
ah! (if our bliss we understand)
how shall we bless the indulgent fate!
indulgent fate, that with content have store
our rural board,
a rarity never sound among the cate
of most voluptuous potentate.
