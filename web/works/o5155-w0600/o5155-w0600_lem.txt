a vernal ode.

send to his grace the lord archbishop of Canterbury, march 12, 1754. 

by FRANCIS Fawkes, a. m. 

i 

bright god of day, who genial, power
revive the bury seed,
that spread with foliage every bower,
with verdure every mead,
bid all thy vernal breeze fly,
diffuse mildness through the sky;
give the soft season to our droop plain,
sprinkle with rosy dew, and salutary rain.

ii.

enough have winter hand severe
hurl all his terror round,
chill the fair dawn of the year,
and whiten all the ground:
give but thy vital beam to play,
the freeze scene will melt away;
and, mix in sprightly dance, the bloom hour
will awake the drowsy spring, and spring awake the flower.

let health, gay daughter of the sky,
on zephyr wing descend,
and scatter pleasure as she fly
where surry down extend;
there herring woo her friendly power,
there may she all her rose shower,
to heal that shepherd all her balm employ,
so will she sooth our fear, and give a nation joy.

iv.

ah i! that virtue godlike friend
so soon be claim by fate!
lo! Pelham to the grave descend,
the bulwark of the state:
when will fair truth his equal find
among the best of human kind?
long be the fatal day with mourning keep!
AUGUSTUS sigh sincere, and all the worthy weep.

v. 

thy delegate, kind heaven, restore
to health, and safe keep;
let good AUGUSTUS sigh no more,
no more the worthy weep:
and still upon the royal head
the riches of thy blessing shed:
establish with his counsellor around,
long be his prosperous reign, and all with glory crown.
