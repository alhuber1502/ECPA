SONG

YES, thou art changed since first we met,
 But think not I shall e'er regret,
 Though never can my heart forget,
 The charms that once were thine:
 For, Marian, well the cause I know
 That stole the lustre from thine eye;
 That proved thy beauty's secret foe,
 And bade thy bloom and spirits fly:
 What laid thy health, my Marian, low,
 Was anxious care of mine. 

O'er my sick couch I saw thee bend
 The duteous wife, the tender friend,
 And each capricious wish attend
 With soft, incessant care. 
Then trust me, love, that pallid face
 Can boast a sweeter charm for me,
 A truer, tenderer, dearer grace
 Than blooming health bestowed on thee; .... 
For there thy well-tried love I see,
 And read my blessings there.
