[sketch of his own character]

too poor for a bribe and too proud to importune,
he have not the method of make a fortune:
can love and can hate, so be think somewhat odd;
no very great wit, he believe in a god.
a post or a pension he do not desire,
but left church and state to Charles Townshend and squire.
