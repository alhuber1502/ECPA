extempore line,

to a young lady with a anemone. 

in love soft empire, beauty boast to reign;
yet beauty queen once mourn her empire vain,
unmoved by scorn, her undiminished truth,
change into this gay flower the breathless youth,
the worth of constant woman still to raise,
so tell the fable tale of ancient day.

the fair Narcissus oft your favour try,
and oft you throw the scent fop aside;
here native beauty, vivid colour glow,
your present votary be no perfume beau;
his honour station be a lady breast,
his charter hold, from what he once possess.
