THE TOOTH

O Look not, lady, with disdain! 
Nor fill our hearts with ruth;
 You still may charm some humble swain,
 Altho' you've lost a tooth! 

Thy beaming eyes are black as jet,
 And pretty is thy mouth;
 No angel ever smil'd so sweet,
 Before you lost a tooth. 

While fondly thus you strive to shine
 In all the charms of youth;
 Your face and figure e'er divine,
 But, O! you've lost a tooth. 

Ah! why that angry frown? for shame! 
I only speak the truth:
 It cannot hurt Eliza's fame
 To say she's lost a tooth. 

But search some hearts, perhaps you'll find
 A greater fault forsooth;
 O! it were well for woman kind
 Were all their loss a tooth!
