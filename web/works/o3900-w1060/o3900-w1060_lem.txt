iiii hymn to Christ.

i 

Saviour, the world and i,
 be ever grief like thy! 
thou my pain, my curse have take,
 all my sin be lay on thou;
 help i, lord; to thou i look,
 draw i, saviour, after thou. 

ii.

it be do! my god have die,
 my love be crucify! 
break this stony heart of i,
 pour my eye a ceaseless flood,
 feel, my soul, the pang divine,
 catch, my heart, the issue blood! 

iii.

when, o my god, shall i
 for thou submit to die? 
how the mighty debt repay,
 rival of thy passion prove? 
lead i in thyself the way,
 melt my hardness into love. 

iv.

to love be all my wish,
 i only live for this:
 grant i, lord, my heart desire,
 there by faith for ever dwell:
 this i always will require
 thou and only thou to feel. 

v. 

thy power i pant to prove
 root and fix in love,
 strengthen by thy spirit may,
 wise to fathom thing divine,
 what the length and breadth and height,
 what the depth of love like thy. 

vi.

ah! give i this to know
 with all thy saint below. 
swell my soul to compass thou,
 gasp in thou to live and move,
 fill with all the deity,
 all immerse and lose in love!
