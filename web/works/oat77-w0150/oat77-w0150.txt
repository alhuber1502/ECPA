The Unconfin'd.

BElieve me Nymph you strive in Vain
My Passion to Confine:
'Tis noble, and must need repine
To wear the Slaves most Servile Badge, the Chain. 
'Tis more than all your Charms can do
To lay Restraint on Love;
But if you are dispos'd to prove
Your Beauties utmost Pow'r, pursue
Some likelier Enterprize; but spare
Your vain Attempts to bind
What is by Nature Unconfin'd,
For Love's a Planet, not a fixed Star.
