the unconfined.

believe i nymph you strive in vain
my passion to confine:
it be noble, and must need repine
to wear the slave most servile badge, the chain. 
it be more than all your charm can do
to lay restraint on love;
but if you be dispose to prove
your beauty utmost power, pursue
some likely enterprise; but spare
your vain attempt to bind
what be by nature unconfined,
for love a planet, not a fix star.
