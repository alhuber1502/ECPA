a ode inscribe to the right honourable the earl of Sunderland at Windsor. 

by the same.

i 

thou dome, where Edward first enrol
his red-cross knight and baron bold,
who vacant seat, by virtue buy,
ambitious emperor have seek;
where britain foremost name be find,
in peace belove, in war renowned,
who make the hostile nation moan,
or bring a blessing on their own:

ii.

once more a son of spencer wait,
a name familiar to thy gate,
spring from the chief who prowess gain
the garter, while thy founder reign.
he offer here his dint shield,
the dread of Gauls in cressi field,
which in thy high-arched temple raise,
for four long century have blaze.

iii.

these seat our sire, a hardy kind,
to the fierce son of war consign,
the flowery of chivalry, who draw
with sinewy arm the stubborn yew;
or with heave pole-axe clear the field,
or who in joust and tourney skill,
before their lady eye renowned,
throw horse and horseman to the ground.

iv.

in aftertime, as court refine,
our patriot in the list be join,
nor only Warwick stain with blood,
or marlb'rough near the danube flood,
have in their crimson cross glow;
but, on just lawgiver bestow,
these emblem Cecil do invest,
and gleam on wise Godolphin breast.

v. 

so Greece, ere art begin to rise,
fix huge Orion in the sky,
and stern alcides, fame in war,
bespangle with a thousand star;
until letter Athens round the pole
make gentle constellation roll,
in the blue heaven the lyre she string,
and near the maid the balance hang.

vi.

then, spencer, mount amid the band,
where knight and king promiscuous stand.
what though the hero flame repress
burns calm in thy generous breast;
yet who more dauntless to oppose
in doubtful day our homebred foe?
who raise his country wealth so high,
or view with less desire eye?

vii.

the sage who large of soul survey
the globe, and all its empire weigh,
watchful the various clime to guide,
which sea, and tongue, and faith divide,
a noble name in windsor shrine
shall leave, if right the muse divine,
than spring of old, abhor and vain,
from ravage realm and myriad slay.

viii.

why praise we, prodigal of fame,
the rage that set the world on flame?
my guiltless muse his brow shall bind
who godlike bounty spare mankind:
for those, who bloody garland crown,
the brass may breathe, the marble frown;
to he, through every rescue land,
ten thousand live trophy stand.
