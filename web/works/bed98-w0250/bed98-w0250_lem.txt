to the same.

if prosperous scene shall open on our way,
friendship have charm to gild the happy day,
and numerous grief humanity may feel,
her soothe power have suit balm to heal;
as she recede, our energy subside,
and earth gay scene appear a languid void;
thus droop flower when chill by midnight air,
contract their leaf, and fold themselves with care;
but when the sun ascend to light the day,
they soon expand to catch the vital ray;
with animate vigour see they rise,
beneath the azure of unclouded sky;
but, if the hollow wind and beat rain,
sweep over the hill, and deluge on the plain;
deny the genial beam which give they birth,
they then unheeded sink to native earth.
