a dream.

a peaceful morn the sweet of spring convey,
 a radiant beam to usher in the day;
 soft as the breeze in whisper seem to say,
 in angel mildness beg i to obey. 
thus raise to hope; but glide my dream away,
 her form transparent, bright than the day. 
what joy sublime, what innocence around,
 with kind benevolence and myrtle crown;
 still in my ear melodious sound i hear,
 ecstatic theme of her eternal year.
