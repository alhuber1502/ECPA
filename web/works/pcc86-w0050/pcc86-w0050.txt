A DREAM.

A Peaceful morn the sweets of spring convey,
 A radiant beam to usher in the day;
 Soft as the breeze in whisper seem'd to say,
 In angel mildness begg'd me to obey. 
Thus rais'd to hope; but glides my dream away,
 Her form transparent, brighter than the day. 
What joy sublime, what innocence around,
 With kind benevolence and myrtle crown'd;
 Still in my ear melodious sounds I hear,
 Ecstatic themes of her eternal year.
