the black cock,

write for a welch air, call “the note of the black cock.”

good morrow to thy sable beak,
 and glossy plumage, dark and sleek,
 thy crimson moon and azure eye,
 cock of the heath, so wild shy! 
i see thou, sly cower, through
 that wiry web of silver dew,
 that twinkle in the morning air,
 like easement of my lady fair. 

a maid there be in yonder tower,
 who, peep from her early bower,
 half show, like thou, with simple wile,
 her braid hair and morning smile. 
the rare thing with wayward will,
 beneath the covert hide they still:
 the rare thing to light of day
 look short forth, and shrink away. 

one fleet moment of delight,
 i sun i in her cheer sight;
 and short, i ween, the term will be,
 that i shall parley hold with thou. 
through snowdon mist red beam the day;
 the climb herdboy chant his lay;
 the gnat-flies dance their sunny ring;
 thou be already on the wing.
