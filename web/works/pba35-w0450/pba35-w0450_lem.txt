write for my son to his master, on the anniversary of the battle of the Boyne.

be what we owe great William then
 forget by ungrateful man? 
and have his fame run out its date,
 who snatch we from the brink of fate? 
else, why shall scholar, sir, i pray,
 be prisoner on this glorious day;
 when nassau arm, by heaven decree,
 devote it to liberty?
