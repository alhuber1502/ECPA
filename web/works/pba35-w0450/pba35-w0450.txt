Written for my Son to his Master, on the Anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne.

Is what we owe great William then
 Forgotten by ungrateful Men? 
And has His Fame run out its Date,
 Who snatch'd us from the Brink of Fate? 
Else, why should Scholars, Sir, I pray,
 Be Prisners on this glorious Day;
 When Nassau's Arms, by Heav'n's Decree,
 Devoted it to Liberty?
