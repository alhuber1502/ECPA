epitaph on a young nobleman, kill in a engagement at sea.

youth, beauty, strength, the trophy, and the bust,
 not these his honour to the tomb we trust;
 but modest manner, innocent of art,
 the open nature, and the moral heart. 
such love of truth as ancient britain bore,
 such fortitude, as never roman more:
 and call betimes, his task of glory do,
 to mix with nature social as his own.
