EPITAPH On a Young NOBLEMAN, Kill'd in an ENGAGEMENT at SEA.

Youth, beauty, strength, the trophy, and the bust,
 Not these his honours to the Tomb we trust;
 But modest manners, innocent of art,
 The open nature, and the moral heart. 
Such love of truth as ancient Britains bore,
 Such fortitude, as never Roman more:
 And call'd betimes, his task of glory done,
 To mix with nature's social as his own.
