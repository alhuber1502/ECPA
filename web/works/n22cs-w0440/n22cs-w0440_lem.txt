sonnet [44] xliv write in the church yard at Middleton in Sussex. 

press by the moon, mute arbitress of tide,
 while the loud equinox its power combine,
 the sea no more its swell surge confine,
 but over the shrink land sublime ride. 
the wild blast, rise from the western cave,
 drive the huge billow from their heave bed;
 tear from their grassy tomb the village dead,
 and break the silent sabbath of the grave! 
with shell and seaweed mingle, on the shore,
 lo! their bone whiten in the frequent wave;
 but vain to they the wind and water rave;
 they hear the war element no more:
 while i be doom â€” by life long storm oppress,
 to gaze with envy, on their gloomy rest.
