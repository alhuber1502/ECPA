A Fragment of CHAUCER.

By J. H. Esq

RIGHT wele of lerned clerkis is it sed,
That womenhud for mannis' use is made;
But naughty man liketh not one, or so,
He lusteth aye unthirftily for mo;
And whom he whilome cherished, when tied
By holy church he cannot her abide.
Like unto dog which lighteth of a bone,
His tail he waggeth, glad therefore y-grown,
But thilke same bone if to his tail thou tye,
Pardie, he fearing it away doth fly.
