a fragment of Chaucer.

by J. H. ESQ

right weal of learn clerk be it say,
that womenhud for mannis use be make;
but naughty man like not one, or so,
he lust aye unthirfty for mo;
and who he whilom cherish, when tie
by holy church he can her abide.
like unto dog which light of a bone,
his tail he wag, glad therefore grow,
but thilke same bone if to his tail thou tie,
pardie, he fear it away do fly.
