song viii.

praise to god for learning to read.

i 

the praise of my tongue
 i offer to the lord,
 that i be teach, and learn so young
 to read his holy word. 

ii.

that i be bring to know
 the danger i be in,
 by nature and by practice too,
 a wretched slave to sin. 

iii.

that i be lead to see
 i can do nothing well;
 and whither shall a sinner flee
 to save himself from hell? 

iv.

dear lord. this book of thy
 inform i where to go,
 for grace to pardon all my sin,
 and make i holy too. 

v. 

here i can read, and learn
 how Christ, the son of god,
 have undertake our great concern;
 our ransom cost his blood. 

vi.

and now he reign above,
 he send his spirit down
 to show the wonder of his love,
 and make his gospel know. 

vii.

o may that spirit teach,
 and make my heart receive
 those truth which all thy servant preach
 and all thy saint believe. 

viii.

then shall i praise the lord
 in a more cheerful strain,
 that i be teach to read his word,
 and have not learn in vain.
