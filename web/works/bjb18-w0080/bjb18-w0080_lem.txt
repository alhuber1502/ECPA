a poetical or sound-heart lover farewell to his mistress.

fair nymph, who do my fate controul
 and reign mistress of my soul,
 where thou all bright in beauty ray
 have hold a long tyrannic sway! 
they who the hard rule maintain,
 in their command do still refrain
 from what impossible must prove,
 yet thou have bid i cease to love. 
ah! when the magnet power be over,
 the needle then will point no more,
 and when no verdure clothes the spring,
 the tuneful bird forget to sing;
 but thou, all sweet and heavenly fair,
 will have thy swain from love forbear. 
in pity let thy own dear hand
 a death's-wound to this bosom send:
 this tender heart of pure faith
 may then resign thou with its breath;
 and in the sun-beam of thy eye
 a proud and will victim die. 

but since thou will not have it so,
 far from thy presence will i go;
 far from my heart dear bliss i will stray,
 since i no long can obey. 
in foreign clime i will henceforth roam
 no more to hail my native home:
 to foreign swain i will pour my woe,
 in foreign plain my tear shall flow;
 by murmur stream and shady grove
 shall other echo tell my love;
 and rich flower of vivid hue
 upon my grave shall other maiden strew. 

adieu, dear Phillis! shall thou ever
 some soft and plaintive story hear
 of hapless youth, who vain strive
 with wayward fate, and die for love,
 o think of i! nor then deny
 the gentle tribute of a sigh.
