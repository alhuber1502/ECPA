the complaint of fancy. 

to a. R. C. 

as, muse, late i sit recline,
 and wake dream absorb my mind,
 a damsel come, of various dye,
 like paint Iris from the sky;
 a purfle saffron be her vest,
 and sweet gum-cistus form her crest;
 in many a playful ring, her hair
 fly light and flossy in the air;
 the mantle, blue and gold, she wear,
 a rose of opal hold before,
 while, graceful in her fairy hand,
 appear a crimson-tufted wand,
 who shade on every object throw
 a glow tint of roseate hue. 

 "whence be thou, bloom nymph?" i cry,
 and thus a tuneful voice reply:
 "man call i fancy; at my shrine
" myriad confess my power divine;
 "there painter bend the will knee,
" and laureled poet sue to i:
 "for mine be every vivid ray,
" which partial nature give the day;
 "and, to the music of my song,
" a thousand nameless charm belong. 

 "the friend of happiness, i dwell
" belove alike in court or cell;
 "where glory lift her ardent eye,
" with hasty, kindred zeal i fly,
 "in sunbeam place the hero form,
" and bid his arm command the storm;
 "on swell cloud a altar raise,
" and fan the tower flame of praise. 
 "oft, from the lorn enthusiast lyre,
" my finger strike etherial fire,
 "and give to sound of pierce woe,
" ecstatic rapture fervent glow. 
 "oft sooth the maniac throb vein,
" and grace her simple, wilder strain;
 "the tribe of pain in fetter keep,
" lull wound memory to sleep,
 "and, in the mind of gloomy care,
" bid thought a angel semblance wear. 

 "dear to each bless aÃ«rial power,
" even wisdom call i to her bower;
 "my song her leisure hour beguile,
" and teach her holy lip to smile. 
 "and, when the muse, with thoughtful care,
" have weave chaplet for her hair,
 "i let she, with her myrtle, twine,
" full many a fragrant rose of i. 

 "then why, since all the wise and gay,
" to i a grateful homage pay,
 "since i to all my hand extend,
" and, liberal, every heart befriend,
 "do Nancy from the crowd retire,
" and rend my blossom from her lyre? 
 "though every string the loss bewail,
" and tone of mellow sweetness fail,
 "which use to charm the pensive ear,
" when listen friendship bend to hear. 

 "tell she i wish not to intrude
" upon her sacred solitude,
 "nor cast my undulate chain,
" around her glow heart again;
 "no! every claim i now resign,
" yet let some small regard be i;
 "let one, who nurse her infant year,
" and wipe away some bitter tear,
 "still animate the scene around,
" and make her tread on fairy ground;
 "give playful sweetness to each lay,
" and decorate the pass day. 

 "tell she, if now she scorn my strain;
" she may invoke my name in vain;
 "in vain my proffer aid implore,
" contemn, i hardly pardon more. " 
she say, and spring from the earth,
 attend find her suitor mirth,
 who catch her hand, with lively air,
 and place she in his silver chair,
 which through the yield ether fly,
 and quick bear they from my view.
