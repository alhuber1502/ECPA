to grammaticus.

Mira will with tear atone
 for all the mischief she have do;
 sincere mourn (believe it true)
 the send of her rhyme to you. 

the wound my verse give your ear,
 be undesigned it will appear;
 nor in the least the fault of i,
 as by this sorrow you may see. 

and can i in our meadow find,
 among the vegetable kind,
 a heal simple, that will cure
 those smart pang which you endure:
 who juice the matron well esteem
 for cut and bruise that be green,
 i will send it with a heart most will,
 though it shall cost i half a shilling:
 yet i can serve you but in will,
 for i have consult doctor pill,
 who tell i that a case like you
 will not admit of common cure;
 for that incision make by rhyme
 be worse than ulcer fifty time:
 he give a reason that be clear,
 because they always strike the ear,
 and give unutterable pain
 to the small fibre of the brain:
 yet as the doctor be my friend,
 his worship order i to send
 this grand receipt which he have know,
 to serve in case like your own:
 it be true, the drug be something rare,
 and yet i will not quite despair;
 but hope the medicine may be find
 within the space of british ground:
 this balsam then i will have you seek,
 no matter for its name in greek;
 but sure it be call (or i be wrong)
 good-nature in the english tongue:
 the doctor swear by all his skill,
 if this do ease you, nothing will;
 to either ear be this apply,
 (the better if it be quick try)
 then fill the hollow space full
 with aqua-vitoe drop on wool:
 and take a special care be sure,
 no poet come about your door:
 for you may keep the bench of law,
 or hear the squeak of a see,
 more safe by a hundred time,
 than half a page of modern rhyme:
 but when you gather strength a little,
 can walk abroad and eat your victual? 
as you be mighty fond of verse,
 let some with gentle voice rehearse:
 how corn grow now where Troy town stand,
 or else the child in the wood:
 these gentle number will compose
 your spirit and your eye-lid close! 
those slumber will complete the cure;
 now, sir, your servant, and â€” no more.
