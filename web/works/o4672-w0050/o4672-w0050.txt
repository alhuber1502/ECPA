GOD Incomprehensible.

I.

FAR in the Heav'ns my God retires,
 My God, the point of my Desires,
 And hides his Lovely Face;
 When he descends within my View
 He charms my Reason to pursue,
 But leaves it tir'd and fainting in th' unequal Chase. 

II.

Or if I reach unusual height,
 Till near his Presence brought;
 There Floods of Glory check my Flight,
 Cramp the bold Pinions of my Wit
 And all untune my Thought;
 Plung'd in a Sea of Light I roll,
 Where Wisdom, Justice, Mercy Shines;
 Infinite Rays in Crossing Lines
 Beat thick Confusion on my Sight, and overwhelm my Soul. 

III.

Come to my aid, ye Fellow-Minds,
 And help me reach the Throne,
 (What single Strength in vain designs,
 United Force hath done;
 Thus Worms may Joyn, and grasp the Poles,
 Thus Atoms fill the Sea,)
 But the whole Race of Creature-Souls,
 Stretch'd to their last extent of Thought plunge and are lost in Thee. 

IV.

Great God; behold my Reason lies
 Adoring; yet my Love would rise
 On Pinions not her own:
 Faith shall direct her humble Flight
 Thro' all the trackless Seas of Light
 To Thee th' Eternal Fair, the Infinite Unknown.
