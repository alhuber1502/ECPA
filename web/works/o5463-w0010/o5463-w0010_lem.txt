in two part. 

of all the girl that be so smart,
 there be none like pretty Sally,
 she be the darling of my heart,
 and she live in our alley. 
there be no lady in the land
 be half so sweet as Sally. 
she be the darling of my heart,
 and she live in our alley. 
her father he make cabbage-net,
 and through the steet do cry they. 
her mother she sell lace long
 to those that please to buy they. 
but sure such folk can never beget
 so sweet a girl as Sally,
 she be the darling of my heart,
 and she live in our alley. 
when she be by, i leave my work,
 i love she so sincere. 
my master come like any Turk,
 and bang i most severe. 
but let he bang his bellyful,
 i will bear it all for Sally. 
she be the darling of my heart,
 and she live in our alley. 
of all the day that be in the week,
 i dear love but one day. 
and that be the day that come betwixt
 the Saturday and Monday. 
for then i be dress all in my best,
 to walk abroad with Sally. 
she be the darling of my heart,
 and she live in our alley. 
my master carry i to church,
 and often be i blame,
 because i leave he in the lurch,
 as soon as text be name. 
i leave the church in sermon-time,
 and slink away to Sally,
 she be the darling of my heart,
 and she live in our alley. 
when christmas come about again,
 oh! then i shall have money;
 i will hoard it up, and box it all,
 and give it to my honey. 
i wish it be ten thousand pound,
 i will give it all to Sally,
 she be the darling of my heart,
 and she live in our alley. 
my master and the neighbour all
 make game of i and Sally,
 and but for her i will better be
 a slave, and row a galley. 
but when my seven long year be out,
 oh! then i will marry Sally. 
oh! then we will wed, and then we will bed,
 but not in our alley. 

pretty Sally answer.

of all the lad in London town,
 there be none i love like Johnny. 
he walk so stately over the ground,
 i like he for my honey. 
and none but he i ever will wed,
 as my name be Sally:
 and i will dress i in my best,
 in spite of all our alley. 
because that nan and Sue do say,
 that live in our alley,
 unto Bess franklin, do but see,
 look there go pretty Sally. 
but let they know, though they say so,
 that i have store of money. 
and can a hundred pound bestow
 on John, my dear honey. 
it be true my father deal in net,
 my mother in long lace. 
but what of that, if johnny please,
 'twon hinder our embrace. 
for Johnny he do often swear,
 he dear love his Sally. 
and for the neighbour i do care,
 we will live in our alley. 
it be true, when Johnny come along,
 and i by chance do meet he,
 his master come out with a stick,
 and sore he do beat he,
 yet Johnny shall be make amends,
 when his time be out, by Sally,
 in spite of all the rogue and whore
 that live in our alley. 
there be one day in every week
 that Johnny do come to i. 
and then i own i be well please,
 when he do kiss and woo i. 
then in the field we walk and talk,
 he call i dear Sally,
 i love he, and i will have he too,
 in spite of all our alley. 
his cheek be of a crimson red,
 black eyebrow he do carry. 
his temper be so sweet and good,
 my Johnny i will marry. 
though all our neighbour spite we sore,
 because Johnny love his Sally. 
but i love Johnny more and more. 
and a fig for all our alley. 
old woman grumble, and the maid
 be all in love with Johnny
 their guts to fiddlestring may fret,
 for he will not leave his honey. 
at midsummer his time be out,
 then hand-inhand will Sally
 unto the parson with he go,
 in spite of all our alley.
