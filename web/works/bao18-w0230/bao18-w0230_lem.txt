to Lothario.

think not, Lothario, while i view
 the bright expression of thy face,
 and on thy cheek of crimson hue
 emotion vary beauty trace,

that in my heart one feeling dwell,
 but what the cold must approve,
 nor think my conscious bosom swell
 with aught resemble secret love. 

no .... still these eye can fix on thy,
 nor fear their keen glance to meet;
 and when thou bold search i,
 my quiet heart disdain to beat. 

but, if by vain selflove mislead,
 thou in my look can passion see;
 and think, by weak illusion feed,
 my tower hope aspire to thou .... 

let we my absent Henry seek;
 and when he meet my conscious eye,
 in every glance my heart will speak,
 and plain tell for who it sigh.
