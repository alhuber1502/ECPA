the penitent.

occasion by the author being ask if she will take ten pound for her poem.

when parthenissa talk today
 of profit and of mira lay,
 and listen Mira hear the sound
 of number ten with add pound,
 the saucy minx betray her pride,
 and turn her scornful head aside:
 you, doubtless, madam, wonder why,
 and hardly can believe it be i:
 but all have fault, and it will be vain
 to boast a heart that be free from stain. 
this maxim Mira prove be true,
 no golden apple lie in view
 across her path — and yet she fall:
 the cause — have patience and we will tell,
 you see not — no, to my surprise
 it scape your penetrate eye;
 the wicked knot — it be new today,
 the knot — what colour be it, pray? 
so gay, it will make a hermit vain;
 then wonder not at mira brain. 

but now disrobe — with dirty shoe
 and apron ragged as the muse,
 in nightcap tight and wrap gown,
 no more be see the haughty frown;
 the fatal top-knot lay aside
 with its destructive daughter pride. 
the vain chimeras all be fly,
 and reason reassume her throne. 

now, can you find a honest dealer,
 (as a attorney or a Taylor)
 who want a muse that be not too dear,
 send he direct you know where:
 we for a trifle shall not part,
 nor from a easy bargain start,
 and that his purchase may be hard,
 i will add of packthread half a yard,
 to satisfy the greedy lout,
 and bind the paper round about.
