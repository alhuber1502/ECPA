fable [25] xxv.

the scold and the parrot.

the husband thus reprove his wife. 
who deal in slander, live in strife. 
be thou the herald of disgrace,
 denounce war to all thy race? 
can nothing quell thy thunder rage,
 which spare nor friend, nor sex, nor age? 
that vixen tongue of you, my dear,
 alarm our neighbour far and near;
 good god! it be like a roll river,
 that murmur flow, and flow for ever! 
never tire, perpetual discord sow! 
like fame, it gather strength by go. 

heighday! the flippant tongue reply,
 how solemn be the fool! how wise! 
be nature choice gift debar? 
nay, frown not; for i will be hear. 
woman of late be fine ride,
 a parrot privilege forbid! 
you praise his talk, his squawl song;
 but wife be always in the wrong. 

now reputation fly in piece
 of mother, daughter, aunt and niece,
 she run the parrot language over;
 bawd, hussy, drunkard, slattern, whore,
 on all the sex she vent her fury,
 try and condemn without a jury. 

at once the torrent of her word
 alarm cat, monkey, dog and bird;
 all join their force to confound she,
 puss spit, the monkey chatter round she,
 the yelp cur her heel assault,
 the magpie blab out all her fault;
 poll, in the uproar, from his cage,
 with this rebuke out-screamed her rage. 

a parrot be for talk prize,
 but prattle woman be despise;
 she, who attack another honour,
 draw every live thing upon she. 
think, madam, when you stretch your lung,
 that all your neighbour too have tongue;
 one slander must ten thousand get,
 the world with interest pay the debt.
