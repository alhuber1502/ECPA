sonnet.

forsake the sparkle eye of joy,
on downy wing, oh! balmy sleep;
swift all thy gentle power employ,
to close the eye that weep.

confine within their ebon cell,
all thy terrific vision stay;
wide, where thy dream of pleasure dwell,
the ivory gate display.

the sicken heart thy power release,
from every feel, or threaten harm;
let former day return to bless,
and fond illusion charm.

whatever of dear depart good,
the pensive mourner can deplore;
thou may, in path with pleasure strew,
kind again restore.

there â€” bliss of youth! the approve friend,
and health, and dear parental love;
joy, which all earthly joy transcend,
with the free spirit rove.

oh sleep! display thy vision fair,
where grief have sow its thorn within;
till death, dissolve mortal care,
shall realize the scene.
