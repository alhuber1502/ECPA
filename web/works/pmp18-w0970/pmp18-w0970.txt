In the same [Chaucer's] Style.

Fair Susan did her Wif-hede well menteine,
 Algates assaulted sore by Letchours tweine;
 Now, and I read aright that Auncient Song,
 Olde were the Paramours, the Dame full yong. 
Had thilke same Tale in other Guise been tolde;
 Had They been Yong (pardie) and She been Olde;
 That, by St Kit, had wrought much sorer Tryal:
 Full merveillous, I wote, were swilk Denyal.
