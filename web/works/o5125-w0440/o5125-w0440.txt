SOTO. A CHARACTER.

IN Soto's Bosom you may find
 The Glimm'ring of a worthy Mind:
 Tis but a faint and feeble Ray,
 Imperfect as the dawning Day;
 Yet were the jarring Passions tun'd,
 And the wild Branches nicely prun'd,
 The Soil from Thorns and Thistles clear,
 Some latent Virtues might appear:
 I'th' Morning catch him, (early tho'
 Your Bird will else be flown, I trow,)
 E'er he has reach'd the bowzing Can,
 You'll find the Stamp of reas'ning Man:
 Then see the Wretch whom none can rule,
 E'er Night a Mad-man and a Fool;
 The witty Soto then you'll find,
 Just level with the brutal Kind. 
With crimson Face and winking Eyes,
 That look like Woodcocks, mighty wise:
 See streams a Current down his Chin,
 From soft Tobacco lodg'd within;
 Be pleas'd to steal a Glance or two,
 But one may serve to make you â€”

He fain wou'd walk, but cannot stand,
 And see a Palsy in his Hand;
 And tho' his Throat has swallow'd down
 Two Gallons of October brown,
 His greedy Guts impatient roar,
 And seem to call aloud for more:
 More they shall have: But hark, within
 Is heard a rude and lawless Din:
 Wind, Ale, and Phlegm their Powers wage,
 And Hickups call them to engage;
 And now, Ah now! incessant flows
 The frothy Tide from Mouth and Nose:
 No more is seen the cover'd Ground,
 But a huge River floating round:
 Down drops the Youth, his giddy Head
 Falls easy on the liquid Bed:
 So swam Achilles fierce and brave,
 On angry Xanthus's swelling Wave;
 And 'scap'd with being wet to th' Skin;
 For Pallas held him up by th' Chin:
 So Bacchus saves, by mighty Charms,
 His helpless Devotee from Harms:
 And Soto sleeps till break of Day,
 Then shakes his Ears and walks away.
