phyllis age.

how old may Phyllis be, you ask,
 who beauty thus all heart engage? 
to answer be no easy task;
 for she have real two age. 

stiff in brocard, and pinch in stay,
 her patch, paint, and jewel on;
 all day let envy view her face;
 and Phyllis be but twenty-one. 

paint, patch, jewel lay aside,
 at night astronomer agree,
 the evening have the day belie;
 and Phyllis be some forty-three.
