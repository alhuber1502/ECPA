PHYLLIS's AGE.

How old may Phyllis be, You ask,
 Whose Beauty thus all Hearts engages? 
To Answer is no easie Task;
 For She has really two Ages. 

Stiff in Brocard, and pinch'd in Stays,
 Her Patches, Paint, and Jewels on;
 All Day let Envy view her Face;
 And Phyllis is but Twenty-one. 

Paint, Patches, Jewels laid aside,
 At Night Astronomers agree,
 The Evening has the Day bely'd;
 And Phyllis is some Forty-three.
