[moral song] ii. innocent play.

i 

a broad in the meadow to see the young lamb
 run sport about by the side of their dam,
 with fleece so clean and so white;
 or a nest of young dove in a large open cage,
 when they play all in love, without anger or rage,
 how much may we learn from the sight? 

ii.

if we have be duck, we may dabble in mud;
 or dog, we may play till it end in blood;
 so foul and so fierce be their nature:
 but Thomas and William, and such pretty name,
 shall be clean and harmless as dove, or as lamb,
 those lovely sweet innocent creature. 

iii.

not a thing that we do, nor a word that we say,
 shall hinder another in jest or play;
 for he be still in earnest that be hurt:
 how rude be the boy that throw pebble and mire! 
there be none but a madman will fling about fire,
 and tell you, "it be all but in sport."
