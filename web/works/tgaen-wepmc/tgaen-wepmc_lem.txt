[epitaph on mrs. Clerke]

lo! where this silent marble weep,
a friend, a wife, a mother sleep:
a heart, within who sacred cell
the peaceful virtue love to dwell.
affection warm, and faith sincere,
and soft humanity be there.
in agony, in death, resign,
she feel the wound she leave behind.
her infant image, here below,
sit smile on a father woe:
who what await, while yet he stray
along the lonely vale of day?
a pang, to secret sorrow dear;
a sigh; a unavailing tear;
till time shall every grief remove,
with life, with memory, and with love.
