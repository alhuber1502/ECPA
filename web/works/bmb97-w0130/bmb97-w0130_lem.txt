rhapsody

lo! here a cloud come sail, rich clad
 in royal purple, which the part beam
 of bounteous Phoebus edge with tint of gold
 and lucid crimson. one may fancy it
 a noble bird, that lave its graceful form,
 and bath its rosy bosom in the light. 
look! how it swell and rear its snowy crest
 with haughty grandeur; while the blue expanse,
 in smile patience let the boaster pass,
 and swell his train with all the lazy vapour
 that hover in the air: a easy prey
 to the gigantic phantom, who curl wing,
 sweep in these worthless trifler of the sky,
 and wrap they in his bosom. go, vain shadow! 
sick with the burden of thy fancy greatness,
 a breath of zephyr waft thou into nothing,
 scatter thy spread plume, uncrown thy front,
 and drive thou downward to thy mother earth,
 to mix with vapour and dissolve in dew. 

such be the dream of hope, which to the eye
 of youthful inexperience, seem to touch
 the pure, unclouded sky of certainty. 
buoy up by the fond eloquence of thought,
 and nurture by the smile of vanity,
 each hour the air-borne vision gather bulk,
 and fancy deck it with a thousand hue,
 vary and wild, till it abound in charm
 which sink the soul to sadness, when the breath
 of gentle reason break the beauteous bubble,
 and leave we nought but vain regret behind.
