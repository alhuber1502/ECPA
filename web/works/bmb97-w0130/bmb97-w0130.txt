RHAPSODY

LO! here a cloud comes sailing, richly clad
 In royal purple, which the parting beams
 Of bounteous Phoebus edge with tints of gold
 And lucid crimson. One might fancy it
 A noble bird, that laves its graceful form,
 And bathes its rosy bosom in the light. 
Look! how it swells and rears its snowy crest
 With haughty grandeur; while the blue expanse,
 In smiling patience lets the boaster pass,
 And swell his train with all the lazy vapours
 That hover in the air: an easy prey
 To the gigantic phantom, whose curl'd wing,
 Sweeps in these worthless triflers of the sky,
 And wraps them in his bosom. Go, vain shadow! 
Sick with the burthen of thy fancied greatness,
 A breath of zephyr wafts thee into nothing,
 Scatters thy spreading plumes, uncrowns thy front,
 And drives thee downward to thy mother earth,
 To mix with vapour and dissolve in dew. 

Such are the dreams of hope, which to the eye
 Of youthful inexperience, seem to touch
 The pure, unclouded sky of certainty. 
Buoy'd up by the fond eloquence of thought,
 And nurtur'd by the smile of vanity,
 Each hour the air-born vision gathers bulk,
 And Fancy decks it with a thousand hues,
 Varied and wild, till it abounds in charms
 Which sink the soul to sadness, when the breath
 Of gentle Reason breaks the beauteous bubble,
 And leaves us nought but vain regret behind.
