line for a friend album.

line, in addition to the treasure
 of poesy, cull for the pleasure
 of beau and belle and gentle dame,
 when seat round the evening flame,
 what time the social hour be wane,
 and tardy coachman guest detain, —
 a courteous friend have bid i write
 upon her album page white. 

but age the easy grace have lose
 that will become such page most,
 while of a quondam rhymester skill,
 scarce aught be extant but the will;
 and sober, stint age must use
 the school-girl wear and stale excuse,
 when, long her correspondent debtor,
 the apology become the letter. 

apology for those who need they! 
a album be a thing of freedom,
 receive all with right good will
 that fortune send from many a quill,
 and then display like scaly store
 which fisher net bring to the shore:
 the herring sheathe in silvery green,
 the whiting in its pearly sheen,
 the lithe and wavy eel that glide
 athwart the mackerel tabbied side;
 John dory with his dolphin head,
 where amber fin like horn be spread,
 and flounder, sole, and thornback, all
 in turn on some observer call
 to mark each vary form and tint;
 and from this simile a hint
 of some encouragement i take,
 and humble this my offer make,
 which if receive with favour, true
 will show that i have reckon due
 on what may homely thing commend, —
 on the good nature of a friend.
