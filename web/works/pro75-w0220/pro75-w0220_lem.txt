song.

i

you crystal fountain, soft flow,
you gentle gale, ah! cease to blow,
for know my bloom constant swain,
do calm sleep, on yonder plain.

ii

propitious power, afford that rest,
which ever dwell within his breast,
with caution guard his radiant charm,
and shield his heart, from rude alarm.

iii

around my love, you violet spring,
in plaintive note, you warbler sing,
you rose bloom, about his head,
and sweet scent, his mossy bed.

iv

you little cupid, quick bring,
each green, that deck the verdant spring,
there form a sweet sequester grove,
and hide secure, my beauteous love.
