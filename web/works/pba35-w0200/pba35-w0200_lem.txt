upon see a Raffle for Addison work unfilled.

you gentle beaux, and thoughtless bell,
 who gay rove at tunbridge-well,
 with pocket full; and empty look,
 raffle for every toy — but book:
 shall addison immortal page
 (the glory of his land and age)
 want two subscription to be full,
 the world will dare pronounce you dull. 

be wise — subscribe — and show, at least;
 that you have one pretence to taste.
