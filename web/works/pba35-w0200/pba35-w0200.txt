Upon seeing a Raffle for Addison's Works unfill'd.

Ye gentle Beaux, and thoughtless Belles,
 Who gaily rove at Tunbridge-Wells,
 With Pockets full; and empty Looks,
 Raffling for ev'ry Toy — but Books:
 Should Addison's immortal Page
 (The Glory of his Land and Age)
 Want two Subscriptions to be full,
 The World will dare pronounce you dull. 

Be wise — subscribe — and shew, at least;
 That you have one Pretence to Taste.
