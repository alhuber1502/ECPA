To the Honble. Miss Carteret, now Countess of Dysert. 

Fair Innocence, the Muses loveliest Theme! 
On Acts of Mercy sound thy rising Fame. 
Let others from frail Beauty hope Applause:
 Plead thou the Fatherless, and Widow's Cause. 
Fly to your Mother; let each winning Grace
 Engage Compassion for my helpless Race. 
So shall the wond'ring World be taught from thence,
 Beauty is but your second Excellence.
