to the honourable. miss Carteret, now countess of desert.

fair innocence, the muse lovely theme! 
on act of mercy sound thy rise fame. 
let other from frail beauty hope applause:
 plead thou the fatherless, and widow cause. 
fly to your mother; let each win grace
 engage compassion for my helpless race. 
so shall the wonder world be teach from thence,
 beauty be but your second excellence.
