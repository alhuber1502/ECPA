the Cumberland scold. 

our Dick sae cross — but what of that! 
i will tell you all the matter;
 Pou up your head; ay, devil may cure,
 say, women-fwok must chatter. 
and so they may; they have much to say,
 but little be they meynd;
 obey! be sec a fearful word,
 and that the marry find it. 

our Dick come in, and say it rain,
 say i, it make no matter;
 "ay, but it this, tou silly fuil! —
 but women-fwok must clatter:
 they be here and there, and every where,
 and meakin sec a rumble,
 with te-te-te, and te-te-te,
 and grumble, grumble, grumble!" 

 "say i to Dick, to Dick, say i,
 there be nought in life can match thou! 
thy temper ayway burst out,
 and nought i say can patch thou. 
It be ass, and fuil, and silly snuil,
 I be nothing but a noodle;
 It be ayways wrang, and never reet,
 and doodle, doodle, doodle." 

 "devil bin!" say Dick, "if what i say
 be nit as true as beyble! 
and gin i put te into print,
 the fwok will have caw a reyble:
 for devil a clout can tou set on,
 in any form or fashion,
 or dui or say a single thing
 to keep then out of passion." 

 "tou be a bonny guest, indeed! 
tou be a toppin fellow! 
i think thy breast be mead of brass,
 tou this sae rwoar and bellow:
 i nobbet wish that i be deaf,
 there be ayways sec a dingin;
 i never ken what It be about,
 there be sec a ring, ring, ring." 

 "whea ever ken what tou' about? 
tou' ayways in a ponder;
 ay geavin with thy open mouth,
 and wonder, wonder, wonder! 
but of all the wonder in this warl,
 i wonder we ever marry;
 it will have have be a bonny thing
 have that breet think miscarry." 

 "but, hark you, Dick! i will tell you what, —
 it be i that mead the blunder;
 that i tuik up with leyke of thou,
 be far the greet wonder! 
for tou be nowther guide nor rich,
 and tempert leyke old scratchum! 
the devil a day gang our my head,
 but, fratchum, fratchum, fratchum!"
