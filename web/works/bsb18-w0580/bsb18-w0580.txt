THE CUMBERLAND SCOLD. 

OUR Dick's sae cross — but what o' that! 
I'll tell ye aw the matter;
 Pou up yer heads; ay, deil may cure,
 Say, women-fwok mun chatter. 
And sae they may; they've much to say,
 But little are they meynded;
 OBEY! is sec a fearfu' word,
 An' that the married find it. 

Our Dick came in, and said it rain'd,
 Says I, it meks nae matter;
 "Ay, but it dis, tou silly fuil! —
 But women-fwok mun clatter:
 They're here an' there, an' ev'ry where,
 And meakin sec a rumble,
 Wi' te-te-te, an' te-te-te,
 An' grumble, grumble, grumble!" 

 "Says I to Dick, to Dick, says I,
 There's nought i' life can match thee! 
Thy temper's ayways bursting out,
 And nought I say can patch thee. 
I's ass, and fuil, and silly snuil,
 I's naething but a noodle;
 I's ayways wrang, and never reet,
 And doodle, doodle, doodle." 

 "Deil bin!" says Dick, "if what I say
 Is nit as true as beyble! 
And gin I put te into print,
 The fwok wad caw't a reyble:
 For deil a clout can tou set on,
 In ony form or fashion,
 Or dui or say a single thing
 To keep yen out o' passion." 

 "Tou is a bonny guest, indeed! 
Tou is a toppin fellow! 
I think thy breast is meade o' brass,
 Tou dis sae rwoar and bellow:
 I nobbet wish that I were deef,
 There's ayways sec a dingin;
 I never ken what I's about,
 There's sec a ring, ring, ringing." 

 "Whea ever kens what tou's about? 
Tou's ayways in a ponder;
 Ay geavin wi' thy open mouth,
 And wonder, wonder, wonder! 
But of aw the wonders i' this warl,
 I wonder we e'er married;
 It wad hae been a bonny thing
 Had that breet thout miscarried." 

 "But, hark ye, Dick! I'll tell ye what, —
 'Twas I that meade the blunder;
 That I tuik up wi' leyke o' thee,
 Was far the greetest wonder! 
For tou was nowther guid nor rich,
 And tempert leyke auld Scratchum! 
The deil a day gangs owre my head,
 But, fratchum, fratchum, fratchum!"
