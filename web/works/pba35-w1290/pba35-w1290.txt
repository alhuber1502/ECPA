Verses sent to a Lady, who took Delight in ridiculing a Person of very weak Under-standing, whom she reliev'd from Want.

Should you employ your Ridicule,
 On those who Pity claim? 
Think, Birtha, is the native Fool
 For Wit a proper Theme? 

On Vice your hum'rous Vein display;
 'Tis meritorious there;
 Or tow'ring Vanity allay;
 But, O! Misfortune spare. 

With Wisdom who endows the Brain,
 To thy Remembrance call;
 Nor, while the Wretched you sustain,
 Tincture their Cup with Gall.
