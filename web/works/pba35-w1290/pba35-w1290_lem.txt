verse send to a lady, who take delight in ridicule a person of very weak understanding, who she relieve from want.

shall you employ your ridicule,
 on those who pity claim? 
think, Birtha, be the native fool
 for wit a proper theme? 

on vice your humorous vein display;
 it be meritorious there;
 or tower vanity allay;
 but, o! misfortune spare. 

with wisdom who endow the brain,
 to thy remembrance call;
 nor, while the wretched you sustain,
 tincture their cup with Gall.
