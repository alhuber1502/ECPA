Supplication for Grace.

Prayer to CHRIST before the Sacrament.

From the same.

I.

O Thou, whom Sinners love, whose Care
 Does all our Sickness heal,
 Thee we approach with Heart sincere,
 Thy Pow'r we joy to feel. 
To Thee our humblest Thanks we pay
 To Thee our Souls we bow;
 Of Hell erewhile the helpless Prey,
 Heirs of thy Glory now. 

II.

As Incense to thy Throne above
 O let our Pray'rs arise! 
O wing with Flames of Holy Love
 Our living Sacrifice. 
Stir up thy Strength, O LORD of Might,
 Our willing Breasts inspire:
 Fill our whole Souls with heav'nly Light,
 Melt with Seraphick Fire. 

III.

From thy blest Wounds our Life we draw;
 Thy all-atoning Blood
 Daily we drink with trembling Awe;
 Thy Flesh our daily Food. 
Come, LORD, thy sov'reign Aid impart,
 Here make thy Likeness shine! 
Stamp thy whole Image on our Heart,
 And all our Souls be Thine!
