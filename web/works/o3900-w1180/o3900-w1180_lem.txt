supplication for grace.

prayer to Christ before the sacrament.

from the same.

i 

o thou, who sinner love, who care
 do all our sickness heal,
 thou we approach with heart sincere,
 thy power we joy to feel. 
to thou our humble thanks we pay
 to thou our soul we bow;
 of hell erewhile the helpless prey,
 heir of thy glory now. 

ii.

as incense to thy throne above
 o let our prayer arise! 
o wing with flame of holy love
 our live sacrifice. 
stir up thy strength, o lord of may,
 our will breast inspire:
 fill our whole soul with heavenly light,
 melt with seraphic fire. 

iii.

from thy bless wound our life we draw;
 thy all-atoning blood
 daily we drink with tremble awe;
 thy flesh our daily food. 
come, lord, thy sovereign aid impart,
 here make thy likeness shine! 
Stamp thy whole image on our heart,
 and all our soul be thy!
