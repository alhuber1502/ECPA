November 18, 1799. 

oh, my rash hand! what have thou idle do? 
tear from its humble bank the last poor flower
 that patient linger to this wintery hour:
 expand cheerly to the languid sun
 it flourish yet, and yet it may have blow,
 have not thy sudden desolate power
 destroy what many a storm and angry shower
 have pity spare. the pride of summer go,
 cherish what yet in fade life can bloom;
 and if domestic love still sweet smile,
 if shelter by thy cot he yet beguile
 thy winter prospect of its dreary gloom,
 oh, from the spoiler touch thy treasure screen,
 to bask beneath contentment beam serene!
