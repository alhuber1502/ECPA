plain truth.

by HENRY Fielding, ESQ;

as bathian Venus tother day
invite all the god to tea,
her maid of honour, the miss grace,
attend due in their place,
their godship give a loose to mirth,
as we at butt'ring here on earth.

Minerva in her usual way
rally the daughter of the sea.
madam, say she, your love resort,
the city where you hold your court,
be late fall from its duty,
and triumph more in wit than beauty;
for here, she cry; see here a poem —
it be dalston; you, Apollo, know he.
little persuasion sure invite
Pallas to read what Dalston write:
nay, i have hear that in Parnassus
for truth a current whisper pass,
that Dalston sometime have be know
to publish her work as his own.

Minerva read, and every god
approve — Jove give the critic nod:
Apollo and the sacred nine
be charm, and smile at every line;
and Mars, who little understand,
swear, d—n he, if it be not good.
Venus alone sit all the while
silent, nor deign a single smile.
all be surprise: some think her stupid:
not so her confident esquire Cupid;
for well the little rogue discern
at what his mother be concern,
yet not a word the urchin say,
but hide in hebe lap his head.
at length the rise choler break
from venus lip, — and thus she speak,

that poetry so cram with wit,
Minerva, shall your palate hit,
i wonder not, nor that some prude
(for such there be above the cloud)
shall wish the prize of beauty tear
from she they view with envious scorn.
i poet never please, but when
justice and truth direct their pen.
this Dalston — former I have know he;
henceforth for ever i disown he;
for Homer wit shall i despise
in he who write with Homer eye.
a poem on the fair fair
at bath, and Betty name not there!
have not this poet see those glance
in which my wicked urchin dance?
nor that dear dimple, where he treat
himself with all arabia sweet;
in who soft down while he repose
in vain the lily bloom, or rose,
to tempt he from a sweet bed
of fair white or lively red?
have he not see, when some kind gale
have blow aside the cambric veil,
that seat of paradise, where Jove
may pamper his almighty love?
our milky way less fair do show:
there summer see betwixt hill of snow.
from her love voice whenever she speak,
what softness in each accent break!
and when her dimple smile arise,
what sweetness sparkle in her eye!
can i then bear, enrage she say,
slight offer to my favourite maid,
the nymph who i decree to be
the representative of i?

the goddess cease — the god all bow,
nor one the wicked bard avow,
who, while in beauty praise he write,
dare beauty goddess to omit:
for now their godship recollect,
it be venus self he have neglect,
who in her visit to this place
have still wear Betty dalston face.
