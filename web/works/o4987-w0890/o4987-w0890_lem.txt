a song.

by the same.

you scene that engage my gay youth,
 say, whither so fast do you fly? 
if the lesson you tell i be truth,
 ah! why do you fade from my eye? 

that meadow where often i stray,
 that bank, and yond shadowy tree,
 those stream, with such fondness survey,
 have hide all their sweetness from i. 

yond hill that uprear his smooth head,
 where the wild-thyme its fragrance bestow,
 who verdure have rise from my bed,
 and who breeze have sigh my repose. 

what though from his summit so high. 
flock, cottage, and woodland be see;
 yet no more i with fondness descry,
 for indifference rise between. 

ah! whither, the sweet, do you fly? 
for fancy your absence must mourn;
 ah! say, will you fade from my eye,
 and yet will you never return? 

that valley, who mantle so gay,
 be with primrose and cowslip overspread;
 no long invite i to stray,
 and rifle the sweet of their bed. 

not odious at present they look;
 i discern that their colour be bright;
 but their charm have my fancy forsake,
 and their fragrance forget to delight. 

to my cool attention how dear
 the soothe complaint of the dove! 
i have leave my companion to hear
 the wood-linnet warble her love. 

nor these can my footstep retard;
 or if round i they careless fly,
 from my eye they attract no regard,
 and my ear their soft warble deny. 

ah! sure it be the business of life,
 that bid those endearment depart;
 to involve we in care and in strife,
 that estrange and entangle the heart. 

with destiny all must comply;
 yet can my fancy but mourn,
 for the season that fade from my eye,
 and the sweet that must never return.
