song.

my mother bid i bind my hair
 with band of rosy hue,
 tie up my sleeve with ribbon rare,
 and lace my bodice blue. 

for why, she cry, sit still and weep,
 while other dance and play? 
alas! i scarce can go or creep,
 while Lubin be away. 

it be sad to think the day be go,
 when those we love be near;
 i sit upon this mossy stone,
 and sigh when none can hear. 

and while i spin my flaxen thread,
 and sing my simple lay,
 the village seem asleep, or dead,
 now Lubin be away.
