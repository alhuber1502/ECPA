on the fate of captain G*****

sad on the margin of the deep,
 i see a lady sit and weep,
 array in robe of white;
 below she mark the billow rise,
 above the dark unsettled sky,
 nor shiver at the sight. 

no terror in her look i trace,
 while lightning gleam wild over the waste,
 and hideous thunder roar. 
for o! the mind overcharge with care,
 the heartstruck marble, in despair,
 alas! can feel no more. 

but, like soft rain 'midst summer sun,
 her tear in mild composure run
 from either beam eye;
 and as the gentle gale of spring,
 when eve descend with sable wing,
 so heave her bosom-sigh. 

at length, in move strain, but mild,
 through hollow rock, in echo wild,
 these word assail my ear:
 "you rave wind! thou roll sea! 
" your boisterous rage be lose on i,
 "i have no more to fear. 

 "thou treacherous overswell main,
" o! can thou give my love again
 "to my sad widow sight;
" although his eye be sink in death,
 "he icy lip be void of breath,
" i will kiss they with delight. 

 "what be this i see! — my fancy rave! 
" three lovely form stretch on the wave,
 "and float to the shore. 
" o my lose child! be it you? " 
they answer not —" adieu, adieu! " 
she sigh, and say no more.
