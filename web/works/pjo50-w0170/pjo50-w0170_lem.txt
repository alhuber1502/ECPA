write at fern-hill, while dinner be wait for she.

in imitation of modern pastoral. 

i 

haste, Charlot, haste; and come away,
 for John his cloth ere long must lay. 
come, leave the dinner shall be spoil,
 the beef already too much boil;
 the very turkey on the spit
 cry out, make haste and pick a bit. 
Cook rage and soup have each boil over,
 and thrice the wicked creature swear. 
then, Charlot, haste, and come away,
 for dinner will no long stay. 

ii.

hungry i be, it be true, and cold;
 yet nevertheless shall i be tell,
 that dinner on the table set,
 and thou not come from Denham yet;
 though hungry as a horse i be,
 and twice as cold as charity,
 yet hear i, Charlot, when i swear,
 that very dinner i will forbear:
 and may i feel thy utmost ire,
 if i will go near the small fire. 
then, Charlot haste and come away,
 for hunger sharp, and will not stay. 

iii.

do thou but know, how puss and i
 together for thy presence sigh,
 together for thy absence mourn,
 in murmur sound for thy return;
 thou sure will pack up thy awl,
 and hear at least, when d'oman call. 
nay more, the major bid i say,
 that he impatient at thy stay,
 have mount crop, and jog away. 
then Charlot, haste, out strip the wind,
 lest love grow deaf, as well as blind. 

iv.

Sarah in vain have scrub your room,
 her gentle mistress be not come;
 in vain clean linen she have spread,
 upon your spotless virgin bed. 
thrice have she tumble up the stair,
 and that be good luck the maid aver. 
but yet, i ween, we be never the near,
 if charlot deaf, and will not hear. 
puss slight and abandon may
 sit purr all the live-long day:
 Sarah may tumble up or down,
 may break a limb, or soil her gown:
 the major too, in doleful dump,
 may take the faithful lover jump:
 and i may starve, without relief —
 but see, she come! — John, bring the beef.
