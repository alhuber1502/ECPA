HYMN,

IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH. 

I.

CALM all the tumults that invade
 Our souls, and lend Thy pow'rful aid. 
O Source of Mercy! soothe our pains,
 And break, O break our cruel chains! 
To Thee the captive pours his cry,
 To Thee the mourner loves to fly;
 The incense of our tears receive,
 'Tis all the incense we can give. 

II.

Eternal Power, our cause defend,
 O God! of innocence the friend! 
Near Thee for ever she resides,
 In Thee for ever she confides;
 Thou know'st the secrets of the breast,
 Thou know'st th' oppressor and th' opprest;
 Do Thou our wrongs with pity see,
 Avert a doom offending Thee! 

III.

But should the murd'rer's arm prevail,
 Should tyranny our lives assail,
 Unmov'd, triumphant, scorning death,
 We'll bless Thee with our latest breath! â€”
 The hour, the glorious hour will come,
 That consecrates the patriot's tomb;
 And, with the pang our mem'ry claims,
 Our country will avenge our names.
