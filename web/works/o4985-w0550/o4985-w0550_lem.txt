inscription upon a hermitage.

by the same.

beneath this rural cell
 sweet-smiling peace and calm content
 far from the busy crowd sequester dwell. 
mortal, approach near,
 the hallow seat revere,
 nor bring the loud tumultuous passion here;
 for not for these be mean
 the sacred silence of the stream,
 nor cave prophetic prompt fancy dream;
 if, with presumption rude,
 thy dare step intrude,
 know, that with jealous eye
 peace and content will fly;
 the thoughtful genius of the lone abode,
 and guardian spirit of this solemn wood,
 will sure revenge the sacrilegious wrong;
 reflection tear will then in secret flow,
 and all the haunt solitude belong
 to melancholy train,
 who point the sting of pain
 with keen remorse, and oft redouble woe.
