VERSES UNDER THE BUSTO OF COMUS IN A BUFFET AT HAMMERSMITH.

E AUGUST MDCCL.

BY THE SAME.

WHILE rosy wreaths the goblet deck,
 Thus Comus spoke, or seem'd to speak:
 "This place for social hours design'd,
" May Care and Business never find. 
 "Come, every Muse, without restraint,
" Let Genius prompt, and Fancy paint;
 "Let Wit and Mirth, with friendly strife,
" Chase the dull gloom that saddens life:
 "True Wit, that firm to Virtue's cause
" Respects religion and the laws;
 "True Mirth, that chearfulness supplies
" To modest ears and decent eyes;
 "Let these indulge their liveliest sallies,
" Both scorn the canker'd help of Malice;
 "True to their country and their friend,
" Both scorn to flatter or offend. "
