a song.

in vain you tell your part lover,
 you wish fair wind may waft he over. 
alas! what wind can happy prove,
 that bear i far from what i love? 
alas! what danger on the main
 can equal those that i sustain,
 from slight vow, and cold disdain? 

be gentle, and in pity choose
 to wish the wild tempest loose:
 that throw again upon the coast,
 where first my shipwreck heart be lose,
 i may once more repeat my pain;
 once more in die note complain
 of slight vow, and cold disdain.
