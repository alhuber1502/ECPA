morning.

o morn! i hail thy soft, enchant breeze,
 thy soul-felt presence, and revive light;
 thy glad approach my anxious bosom case,
 and care and sorrow for a while take flight. 

like youth gay hour, or spring delicious season,
 to i once more thy balmy breath appear;
 lose hope return, assume the face of reason,
 and half persuade to flight oppressive fear. 

while darken casement vain light exclude,
 i woo propitious sleep with languid sigh,
 care through the gloom his anxious face obtrude,
 and banish slumber from my weary eye. 

the tedious hour i tell with watchful anguish,
 and oft, o morn! accuse thy long delay:
 i hail thou now, no long vain languish,
 but quit my couch, and bless refresh day. 

through the long night impatient, sad, and weary,
 how melancholy life itself appear! 
lo! cheerful day illume my prospect dreary,
 and how diminish be the ill i fear! 

though, pleasure shine not in the expect morrow,
 though nought be promise but return of care,
 the light of heaven can banish half my sorrow,
 and comfort whisper in the fresh, cool air. 

i hear the grateful voice of joy and pleasure,
 all nature seem my sadness to reprove,
 high trill the lark his wild ecstatic measure,
 the grove resound with liberty and love:

ere his glad voice proclaim thy dawning early,
 how oft deceive i rise thy light to hail;
 through the damp grass hoarse accent sound cheerly,
 as woo his distant love the wakeful rail. 

oh, you! who murmur at the call of duty,
 and quit your pillow with reluctant sloth,
 for who the morn in vain display her beauty,
 while tasteless you can greet her smile so loath;

you can know the charm which over i steal,
 revive my sense as i taste her breath,
 which half repay the agony of feel
 a night of horror, only less than death.
