SONG.

Written in the Year 1733.

By the Same.

I.

THE heavy hours are almost past
That part my Love and me;
My longing eyes may hope at last,
Their only wish to see.

II.

But how, my Delia, will you meet
The man you've lost so long?
Will Love in all your pulses beat,
And tremble on your tongue?

III.

Will you in every look declare
Your heart is still the same?
And heal each idly anxious care
Our fears in absence frame?

IV.

Thus, Delia, thus I paint the scene,
When shortly we shall meet,
And try what yet remains between
Of loit'ring time to cheat.

V.

But if the dream that sooths my mind
Shall false and groundless prove;
If I am doom'd at length to find
You have forgot to love;

VI.

All I of Venus ask, is this;
No more to let us join;
But grant me here the flatt'ring bliss,
To Die and Think you mine.
