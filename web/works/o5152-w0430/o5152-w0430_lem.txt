song.

when Fanny bloom fair
first catch my ravish sight,
strike with her shape and air,
i feel a strange delight:
while eager i gaze,
admire every part,
and every feature praise,
she steal into my heart.

in her bewitch eye
ten thousand love appear;
there Cupid bask lie,
his shaft be hoard there,
her bloom cheek be die
with colour all their own,
excel far the pride
of rose new blow.

her well-turned limb confess,
the lucky hand of Jove;
her feature all express
the beauteous queen of love:
what flame my nerve invade,
when i behold the breast
of that too charm maid
rise, sue to be press!

Venus round Fanny waist,
have her own cestus bound,
with guardian cupid grace,
who dance the circle round.
how happy must he be,
who shall her zone unloose!
that bliss to all, but i,
may heaven and she refuse.
