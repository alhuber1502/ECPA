to mr. JOHN Shute on mr. lock dangerous sickness sometime after he have retire to study the scripture.

i 

and must the man of wondrous mind
 (now his rich thought be just refine)
 forsake our longing eye? 
reason at length submit to wear
 the wing of faith, and lo they rear
 her chariot high, and noble bear
 her prophet to the sky. 

ii.

go, friend, and wait the prophet flight,
 watch if his mantle chance to light
 and seize it for thy own;
 Shute be the darling of his year,
 young Shute his better likeness bear,
 all but his wrinkle and his hair
 be copy in his son. 

iii.

thus when our folly or our fau't
 call for the pity of thy thought,
 thy pen shall make we wise:
 the sally of who youthful wit
 can pierce the british fog with light,
 place our true interest in our sight,
 and open half our eye.
