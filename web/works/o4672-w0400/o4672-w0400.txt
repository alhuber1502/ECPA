TO Mr. JOHN SHUTE ON Mr. LOCK's Dangerous Sickness sometime after he had retired to study the Scriptures.

I.

AND must the Man of wondrous Mind
 (Now his rich Thoughts are just refin'd)
 Forsake our Longing Eyes? 
Reason at length submits to wear
 The Wings of Faith, and Lo they rear
 Her Chariot high, and nobly bear
 Her Prophet to the Skies. 

II.

Go, Friend, and wait the Prophet's Flight,
 Watch if his Mantle chance to light
 And seize it for thy own;
 SHUTE is the Darling of his Years,
 Young SHUTE his better Likeness bears,
 All but his Wrinkles and his Hairs
 Are copy'd in his Son. 

III.

Thus when our Follies or our Fau'ts
 Call for the Pity of thy Thoughts,
 Thy Pen shall make us wise:
 The Sallies of whose Youthful Wit
 Could pierce the British Fogs with Light,
 Place our true Interest in our Sight,
 And open half our Eyes.
