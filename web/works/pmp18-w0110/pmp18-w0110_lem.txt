the despair shepherd.

Alexis shun his fellow swain,
 their rural sport, and jocund strain:
 (heaven guard we all from Cupid bow!) 
he lose his Crook, he leave his flock;
 and wander through the lonely rock,
 he nourish endless woe. 

the nymph and shepherd round he come:
 he grief some pity, other blame:
 the fatal cause all kind seek. 
he mingle his concern with they:
 he give they back their friendly tear:
 he sigh, but will not speak. 

Clorinda come among the rest:
 and she too kind concern express,
 and ask the reason of his woe:
 she ask, but with a air and mein,
 that make it easy foresee,
 she fear too much to know. 

the shepherd raise his mournful head:
 and will you pardon i, he say,
 while i the cruel truth reveal? 
which nothing from my breast shall tear;
 which never shall offend your ear;
 but that you bid i tell. 

it be thus i rove, it be thus complain;
 since you appear upon the plain:
 you be the cause of all my care:
 your eye ten thousand danger dart:
 ten thousand torment vex my heart:
 i love, and i despair. 

too much, Alexis, i have hear:
 it be what i think; it be what i fear:
 and yet i pardon you, she cry:
 but you shall promise never again
 to breath your vow, or speak your pain:
 he bow, obey, and die.
