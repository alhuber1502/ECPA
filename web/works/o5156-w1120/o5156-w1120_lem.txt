a epigram.

by the same.

i drop a thing in verse, without a name;
i feel no censure, and i gain no fame:
the public see the bastard in the cradle,
but never enquire; so leave it to the beadle.
a certain nobleman take up the child,
the real father lie perdue, and smile.
the public now enlarge every grace,
what shine eye it have! how fair a face!
of part what symmetry! what strength divine!
the noble brat be sure of pelops line.
