to the right Hon. the earl of orrery, on his promise to sup with the author.

though the muse have deny i so often before,
 i venture this day to invoke she once more. 
she ask what i want; i say, with delight,
 your lordship have promise to sup here tonight;
 that on a occasion so much to my honour,
 i hope she will excuse i for call upon she. 

to this she reply, with disdain in she look:
 if that be the case, go summon your cook. 
i tell she in answer, how little you eat;
 that in vain i shall hope to regale you with meat;
 that she know, wit and humour to you be a feast,
 who have, though no stomach, a excellent taste. 

this calm her resentment; she pause for a while —
 then the goddess, propitious, reply with a smile:
 if with humour and wit you will have he delight. 
what need i be call? — let the Dean be invite. 
the business be do, if with he you prevail;
 for a Boyle, and a swift, will each other regale.
