the Seeker. 

by the same.

when i first come to London, i ramble about
from sermon to sermon, take a slice and go out.
then on i, in divinity bachelor, try
many priest to obtrude a levitical bride;
and urge their various opinion, intend
to make i wed system, which they recommend.

say a lecherous old friar skulk near lincoln's-inn,
(who trade be to absolve, but who pastime to sin;
who, spiderlike, seize weak protestant fly,
which hang in his sophistry cobweb he spy;)
ah pity your soul, for without our church pale,
if you happen to die, to be damn you can fail;
the bible, you boast, be a wild revelation:
hear a church that can err if you hope for salvation.

say a formal non-con, (who rich stock of grace
lie forward expose in shop-window of face,)
ah! pity your soul: come, be of our sect:
for then you be safe, and may plead you be elect.
as it stand in the act, we can prove ourselves saint,
be Christ little flock every where speak against.

say a jolly church parson, (devote to ease,
while penal law dragon guard his golden fleece,)
if you pity your soul, i pray listen to neither;
the first be in error, the last a deceiver:
that we be the true church, the sense of our tribe be,
and sure in medio tutissimus ibis. 

say a yea and nay friend with a stiff hat and band,
(who while he talk grave will hold forth his hand,)
dominion and wealth be the aim of all three,
though about way and mean they may all disagree;
then prithee be wise, go the quaker by-way,
it be plain, without turnpike, so nothing to pay.
