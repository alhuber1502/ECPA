sonnet ii.

wise, o C*; enjoy the present hour,
the present hour be all the time we have,
high god the rest have place beyond our power,
consign, perhaps, to grief â€” or to the grave.

wretched the man, who toil ambition slave;
who pine for wealth, or sigh for empty fame;
who roll in pleasure which the mind deprave,
buy with severe remorse, and guilty shame.

virtue and knowledge be our better aim;
these help we ill to bear, or teach to shun;
let friendship cheer we with her generous flame,
friendship, the sum of all our joy in one;
so shall we live each moment fate have give;
how long, or short, let we resign to heaven.
