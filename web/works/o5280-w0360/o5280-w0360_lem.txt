ode to conscience.

to mrs. Yearsley.

for ever hail thou great celestial power,
 to who belong the subject â€” earth;
 thou dread companion of the lonely hour,
 who claim with man coeval birth! 
to curb the passion as they rise,
 to fix our hope beyond the sky;
 to thou, dread monarch of the mind,
 have nature god this solemn trust consign. 

at night still hour, when guiltless bosom know,
 the joy that blissful dream bestow;
 O! hither call that solemn tribe
 of day, of year, now long overpass;
 who voice not eastern wealth can bribe,
 while shrink the soul through fear aghast,
 with accent deep as midnight knell
 each impious deed let memory tell;
 and tremble guilt appal shall hear,
 the twofold voice of conscience and of fear. 

on the raven bode wing,
 from the dark domain of woe,
 where the stream of sorrow flow
 hither all thy terror bring;
 of murder ghost,
 by vengeance lead,
 let countless host
 surround the bed. 
where, terror strike, thy frantic victim lie,
 and for each death he give, a thousand die. 

let horror paint that vengeful hour,
 when stern Eliza feel thy power. 
beside who die couch be see
 the ghost of scotia murder queen;
 and where distain with blood
 the injure Essex stand,
 point to that distant shore
 where the tyrant reign no more;
 while fury stern their gloomy torch wave,
 and sink she, tremble, to a hopeless grave.
