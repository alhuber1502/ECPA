SONG XI.

Heaven and Hell.

I.

THERE is beyond the Sky
 A Heav'n of Joy and Love;
 And holy Children when they die
 Go to that World above. 

II.

There is a dreadful Hell,
 And everlasting Pains;
 There Sinners must with Devils dwell
 In Darkness, Fire and Chains. 

III.

Can such a Wretch as I
 Escape this cursed End? 
And may I hope whene'er I die
 I shall to Heav'n ascend? 

IV.

Then will I read and pray,
 While I have Life and Breath;
 Lest I should be cut off to-day,
 And sent t' eternal Death.
