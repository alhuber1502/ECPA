PHILLIS TO DAMON.

A SONG.

Remember, false Damon, how often you've said,
 You lov'd me as well as a man could a maid;
 Though you slight me at last, and I cannot tell why,
 Yet, trust me, I never with sorrow shall die. 

In my bosom so tender, your power to prove,
 You planted the fair blooming flow'ret of love;
 But for its destruction a frown you prepar'd,
 To blast at your pleasure the flowret you rear'd. 

Yet boast not your conquest, tho' from me you part,
 Nor think yourself wholly possess'd of my heart;
 Your smiles are not summer to melt the cold snow,
 And your frowns are not winter, I'd have you to know. 

Go seek for a maid that has money in store,
 And amuse yourself often in counting it o'er;
 Yet, Damon, believe me, your bliss will be small,
 If counting your gold and your silver be all. 

He that sets his heart riches and honour to find,
 Will learn that a kingdom's too small for his mind;
 He hoards up his treasures, and thinks himself scant,
 While the poor that's contented ne'er feels any want. 

The joys of the wealthy are joys of a day,
 For riches have wings and do oft fly away;
 And when they are flying we generally find,
 A long train of sorrow's impending behind. 

May all pleasures attend you, that treasures can bring,
 May you find of your joys a perpetual spring;
 Yet I'll envy her not, that has money in store,
 Nor think myself wretched, although I am poor. 

Perhaps I the truth of some shepherd may prove,
 Whose treasure's contentment, whose pleasure is love;
 Then I without wealth shall be happy as you,
 So Damon, false Damon, for ever adieu.
