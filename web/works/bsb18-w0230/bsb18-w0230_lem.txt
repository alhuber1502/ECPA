on collins ode on the passion,

as recite by mrs. Esten

beneath a sad and silent shade
 afflict poetry be lay;
 the shepherd train, the virgin choir,
 no long listen to her lyre;
 but, all neglect and alone,
 her feeling and her fire be go. 
no zephyr fond sue her breast,
 no nightingale come there to rest;
 the fade vision flee her eye —
 the vision of her ecstasy. 
and if perchance she seek delight,
 it be amid the gloom of night, —
 it be the hour the screechowl cry,
 or roar whirlwind rend the sky,
 to pour her melancholy strain,
 and catch a pleasure from the pain. 

Esten behold her haggard air
 at twilight as she wander there,
 and feel the sympathetic woe
 that taste and feel ever know;
 then eager seek the city throng
 to vindicate the force of song. 
she choose a ode divine wild,
 write by the muses favourite child;
 from Collins be the magic lie,
 that subject passion all obey:
 the crowd the vary influence prove
 of rage, and hope, and fear, and love;
 they still implore she to rehearse,
 and own the thrill power of verse! 

o thou, sweet bard! who now may be
 a shadow fleet over the sea,
 a vapour on the morning rise,
 a whisper wind at evening close;
 or if thy spirit love to dwell
 awhile within the violet bell,
 then, in beatitude of change,
 from star to star exult range;
 live in the lustre of the day,
 or float upon the lunar ray;
 or rapturous join the hallow voice
 where endless Seraphim rejoice;
 o Collins! whatsoever thou be,
 deign, deign to bless thy esten heart;
 a portion of those joy reveal
 which sure she well deserve to feel!
