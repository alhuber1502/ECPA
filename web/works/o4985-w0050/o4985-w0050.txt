ODE TO PEACE,

BY THE SAME.

O Thou, who bad'st thy turtles bear
 Swift from his grasp thy golden hair,
 And sought'st thy native skies:
 When War, by vultures drawn from far,
 To Britain bent his iron car,
 And bad his storms arise! 

Tir'd of his rude tyrannic sway,
 Our youth shall fix some festive day,
 His sullen shrines to burn:
 But thou, who hear'st the turning spheres,
 What sounds may charm thy partial ears,
 And gain thy blest return! 

O Peace, thy injur'd robes up-bind,
 O rise, and leave not one behind
 Of all thy beamy train:
 The British lion, goddess sweet,
 Lies stretch'd on earth to kiss thy feet,
 And own thy holier reign. 

Let others court thy transient smile,
 But come to grace thy western isle,
 By warlike Honour led! 
And, while around her ports rejoice,
 While all her sons adore thy choice,
 With him for ever wed!
