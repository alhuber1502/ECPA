to thyrsis on his pastoral to mr. Creech. 

come all you tender nymph and sigh swain,
 hear how our thyrsis, daphnis death complain
 in note more sweet he do his sorrow tell,
 than the harmonious mournful philomel. 
with his sad air let all our grief combine,
 and sigh echo in the consort join;
 till over the pity plain the tiding spread,
 pan darling Daphnis to Eliziums flee:
 Daphnis the tunefull'st youth we know among,
 the soften swain till gentle thyrsis sing. 
thyrsis, who muse of all our bloom grove,
 best pity lover and best sing of love;
 soft be thy line as the first tender fire,
 that warm the breast ever it commence desire:
 thy move number all our passion share,
 sigh, languish, weep, just what we read we be. 
by the soft magic raise to ecstasy,
 with Daphnis love, and with he too we dy;
 have he address but in thy melt strain,
 (and he can do it, sure if any Swain.) 
the nymph in spite of her presume charm,
 with joy have yield to his wish arm.
 impatient youth, that death itself can bear,
 rather than scorn of the neglect fair:
 but thus we fond rave to miss the joy,
 love natural as life, do life destroy. 
to wit alone passion do fatal prove,
 fool may be lewd but know not how to love;
 since it in learn breast such woe create,
 thyrsis take warn by great Daphnis fate:
 but to your charm caution do needless seem,
 fear less love, on you need not die like he. 
for oh! what nymph can ever so stupid prove,
 as not to melt if thyrsis name but love? 
what pity it be the learn Daphnis die,
 the slight victim of a virgin pride. 
have thou be silent, it more tear have cost,
 now half our grief in admiration lose;
 so well you mourn the shepherd amorous fate,
 in such soft strain his sad fond fall relate. 
Pan will himself quit immortality,
 to be in death so sweet sing by thou.
