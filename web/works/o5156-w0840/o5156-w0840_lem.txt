[epigram]

by the same.

ADAM alone can not be easy,
so he must have a wife, be please you:
but how do he procure his wife,
to cheer his solitary life?
why, from a rib take out his side
be form this necessary bride.
but how do he the pain beguile?
Pho! he sleep sweet all the while.
but when this rib be re-apply,
in woman form, to Adam side,
how then, i pray you, do it answer?
he never sleep so sweet again, sir.
