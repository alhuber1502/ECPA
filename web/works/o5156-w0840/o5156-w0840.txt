[Epigram]

By the Same.

ADAM alone cou'd not be easy,
So he must have a wife, an't please ye:
But how did he procure his wife,
To cheer his solitary life?
Why, from a rib ta'en out his side
Was form'd this necessary bride.
But how did he the pain beguile?
Pho! he slept sweetly all the while.
But when this rib was re-applied,
In woman's form, to Adam's side,
How then, I pray you, did it answer?
He never slept so sweet again, Sir.
