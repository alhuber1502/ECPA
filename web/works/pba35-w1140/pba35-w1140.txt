To a Lady, who valu'd herself on speaking her Mind in a blunt Manner, which she call'd being sincere.

Well you Sincerity display,
 A Virtue wond'rous rare! 
Nor value, tho' the World should say,
 You're rude, so you're sincere. 

To be sincere, then, give me leave;
 And I will frankly own,
 Since you but this one Virtue have,
 'Twere better you had none.
