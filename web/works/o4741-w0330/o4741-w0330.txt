On Delia singing, and playing on Music.

I.

WHEN DELIA tunes her vocal Song,
 And strikes the trembling Strings;
 The list'ning Audience round her throng,
 Admiring, while she sings. 

II.

BUT, when we view the skilful Fair,
 We're struck with more Surprize:
 Before, she only pleas'd our Ear;
 But now, inchants our Eyes. 

III.

BEAUTY and Harmony combin'd,
 Like secret Charms betray;
 Like Ghosts in magic Rings confin'd,
 We cannot stir away. 

IV.

So Birds, imprudent, fall to Ground,
 When pleasing Notes they hear,
 Charm'd with the Piper's artful Sound,
 Till taken in his Snare.
