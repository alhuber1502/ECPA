spring.

April, 1786. 

when winter, with a frown severe,
 have part with the worn-out year;
 the worn-out year, in health decay,
 have run the course — to bloom and fade;
 a snow-wreathed mantle close infold,
 a clasp of icy diamond hold;
 her former pleasantness forget,
 her wood, her grove, remember not. 
the lovely vary tint of green
 fade as if they will never be,
 for who that see that poplar now
 will think ever verdure clothe its brow! 
its robe be go, and there remain
 autumnal leaf of yellow stain;
 the bluster tyrant long have tear
 the linger leaf from the poor thorn, —
 the linger leaf, though fond to stay,
 be sweep by the rude blast away;
 and, fall on the russet ground,
 give to the ear a wintery sound. 

but time, who monarch must obey,
 now melt this freeze pomp away;
 send his harbinger the hour
 before, to speak for fragrant bower;
 bid the green-robed spring come forth,
 and strike the tyrant of the north. 
with lightsome foot they steal away,
 and find she with her bird at play;
 pour such song in the young ear,
 as suit the season of the year. 

Flora the pattern flower be show,
 which on her couch be sweet blow;
 while the light zephyr, pert gay,
 now bring the scent, now bear away. 
 "accept, sweet spring," gay Flora say,
 "this snowdrop with its lowly head;
 wrap up in many a fleece of snow,
 the little lady love to go;
 but her pale cheek will never be see,
 do i not trim her coif with green. 
my sweet violet next behold, —
 how blue it look, inhuman cold! 
yet not thy chill hand can stay
 those sweet that scorn to wait for may! 
the harebell now her goblet bear
 with brimful cup of dewy tear,
 which over primrose pale she shed,
 that scarce have strength to leave their bed,
 till daisy and gay cowslip lead
 their weak sister over the mead,
 and pendant leave begin to spread
 a wave shelter over head;
 the wood and grove await thy will,
 the sickly plant to spare or kill;
 come then, thou sower of the mead,
 and scatter all the promise seed! 
when do, wherever thou move along,
 leaf, plant, and flower shall round thou throng;
 which wander near the tinkle rill,
 shall, stoop, seem to listen still." 

not all the incense Flora pour —
 not all the offering of the hour,
 can make she leave her bless retreat,
 have hope not charm she from her seat;
 she, with a hand hold out to bless,
 and smile that look like happiness,
 declare it be ever to be find;
 then fold the sweet hour around,
 bid she their joyous footstep heed,
 nor fear to sow the small seed. 

fearful she rise, lest the rough wind
 to infant bud shall prove unkind; —
 "though now they seem with health to glow,
 their paint leaf may never blow;
 shall blight arise, oft meet before,
 i never shall see these nursling more;
 but since the hour have lead the way,
 have bathe in tear this April day,
 through all the grove once more i will range,
 once more their dusky livery change." 
a flowery chaplet bind her hair,
 (the sweet wreath a nymph can wear,)
 her dark green robe be border round
 with every flower that love the ground;
 her tress, negligent gay,
 stray far behind, too fond of play,
 because her curl it sad tease
 to be pull rude by the breeze;
 a basket over her arm be hang,
 and plenteous be the seed she fling;
 the fan zephyr help her toil,
 and mix the seed with every soil;
 to the hoar rock the ashling bear,
 who doubt their hold and tremble there,
 but, when a foot once they find,
 court the rough crag, and scorn the wind. 

now flutter leaf crowd on the spray,
 and bird, more flutter still than they,
 the fresh, soft moss cull, —
 from warm sheep the warm wool, —
 the pliant hair to bind around, —
 the firm clay to lay the ground,
 and, to support the mossy roof,
 some wellknown twig of accustom proof,
 and, that the nestling may be find,
 with bark the nest be roughcast round;
 the brittle egg in feather lie,
 the leafy door deceive the eye;
 the little parent, doom to share
 the pleasure with a parent care,
 in dark foliage hide her head,
 of bird, of beast, of man afraid;
 while on the leafy neighbour tree
 her sweet mate keep her company;
 and, when the young one chirp for food,
 he skim the brook, and scour the wood;
 the gild insect catch his eye; —
 why do thou shine, then, glitter fly? 
thy lustre only serve to show
 thy covert to thy deadly foe! 

but now still eve her mantle throw
 over the soft sky of sweet blue;
 the happy bird on topmost spray,
 "sing the last song of the day,"
 rejoice aloud that the hour of rest
 be rock now her quiet nest,
 and that she know the rise morn
 will show she many a hoard of corn;
 at distance see a wander tribe
 that every darken thicket eye;
 and, where the mat moss have wind
 the hawthorn antique root around,
 all full of mirth, and full of glee,
 they hope the blackbird nest to see,
 who bright blue egg, in graceful line,
 will amid the row of pewter shine;
 there speckle and the brown unite,
 the iron-gray and yellow-white;
 nor can the little wren escape,
 though small thing of oval shape. 
these plunderer, as other do,
 hang out their ill-got wealth to view,
 when dresser deck for Sunday show
 call forth their platter row by row;
 what though by some unlucky stroke
 the king or queen or prince be break;
 what though they can no more contain
 the mantling juice in every vein,
 to show you that they yet be there,
 they edge behind, and half appear,
 still ek out the grand design
 of make all the house look fine. 
what more can high-priced bauble do! 
go, search the empty world through! 
the hard-wrought, far-sought, diamond bring —
 that much admire glitter thing;
 from china or Japan go draw
 the gild chair and work of show;
 bid France her silken loom employ,
 and gobelin weave the fall of Troy;
 Panama bid her pearl dispose
 in innocent and humble row;
 yet still, if such thing do but please,
 the cottage shelf may rival these;
 for all depend, we most find,
 upon the eye within the mind;
 then, ignorance, in quiet rest,
 thou be soon please, and cheap bless! 

but think not yet the search be over,
 and school-imp look for egg no more;
 for now among the yellow broom
 you hear their little busy hum. 
the watch parent from his tower
 listen, and tune his pipe no more;
 but, as the satchel-boy draw near,
 his bristle feather shake with fear;
 from bough to bough he hop, and try
 to lead from home their search eye;
 a break wing pretend to show
 drag on the ground, and flutter low,
 disable; see, he can fly,
 though oft he lame seem to try;
 deceive, the imp believe it true,
 and through the prickle hedge pursue,
 till scratch and miserable tear,
 and bleed by every wound thorn,
 the happy parent dart on high,
 and almost seem to reach the sky. 
amaze, provoke, the sufferer now
 examine every twist bough;
 too soon the quick-eyed rifler see
 the well-hid nest midst arch tree;
 soon, soon he bear they into day,
 and laugh hurry all away. 

now morn in all her bloom arise,
 her sleeping-curtain half unclose;
 and look from her crimson bed,
 on night pale cheek warm blush spread;
 her saffron robe gay woodbine tie,
 which nod to the breeze that sigh;
 her golden slipper, pearled with dew,
 a ribbon bind of azure hue;
 and in her hand a vase of flower
 that open and close at certain hour;
 her chamber leave; and in her car,
 that erst be once the morning star,
 begin her journey through the sky,
 bid each shade of orient die
 fall on the mountain hoary head,
 where curl mist grey honour shed, —
 there watch the god of rise day,
 and in devotion melt away. 

it be now the ploughman whistle over
 those furrow field he mow before;
 and nutbrown labour, hard of hand,
 have not one moment leave to stand;
 not even the resting-spade to hold
 while some strange village tale be tell. 
it be eve that leisure bring along,
 companion of the tale and song;
 at her approach, in sober weed,
 when wander through the daisy mead,
 her thoughtful muse shepherd tell
 to bid the gaudy sun farewell. 
year seem to have show she all her folly, —
 to have throw a shade of melancholy
 across her brow, and ever hang
 the instructive lesson on her tongue. 

but not to scorn the aid of dress,
 and make her person please the less,
 think not, all ornament refuse,
 or subject that be but amuse,
 she will not take a equal part,
 or play — unless to win the heart. 
it be she who blow the pipe so shrill,
 and wind the note around the hill,
 till nymph and swain the signal hear,
 and dance in the dale appear. 
with veil throw up she join the throng,
 nor grave nor gay she move along;
 with matron-mixture in her air,
 nor void of mirth, nor free from care;
 dress in a robe of cloud grey,
 her mourning for the loss of day,
 who part beam her toil renew
 to sprinkle every herb with dew;
 the pearly dew, "so sweet clear,
 to hang in every cowslip ear,"
 there tremble till the morning ray
 shall see it shine and melt away. 
for now her mist be curl round,
 and tall dark shadow stalk the ground,
 while twilight close the vapour draw,
 hoodwink the sky and close the view;
 till through the expanse the sail moon
 now bright appear, now hide in gloom,
 her face half show; then a cloud
 enwrap the whole in fleecy shroud;
 the fleecy shroud grow now more bright,
 "turn its line on the night,"
 thin and more thin its veil be see,
 till the full orb look through between;
 on ether bear it glide in state,
 and slow seek the western gate;
 still faint imitate day,
 light the traveller on his way,
 who else have from the cottage see
 the twinkle rush, and bless its light serene. 

but sober joy to eve belong,
 the cheerful fire, the happy throng. 
she see the housewife oft prepare
 the favourite dish and easy chair,
 to welcome home her labour lord,
 and spread some dainty on his board;
 her face display joy and care,
 which spread a change of beauty there,
 that by the vague impartial eye
 may on the cheek neglect die. 
not so; he eat the dish she dress,
 tell she she be kind, and like her mess;
 abroad for dainty he will not roam,
 for every thing be best at home. 
the little prattler have their share
 proportion with exact care;
 the young one on each knee be set, —
 Calls this good boy, and that his pet;
 the rest all climb up his side,
 petition for tomorrow ride. 

thus close many a rural day,
 from plough field to mow hay,
 and on to harvest golden reign,
 till winter sweep the barren plain;
 still every season find he bless
 who wish on his conscience rest;
 rest ever must that man attend
 who be to all his kind a friend!
