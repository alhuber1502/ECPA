a epistle to mr. pope.

by the same.

heaven in the human breast implant
fit appetite for all our want;
with hunger prompt to strengthen food,
with love of praise to public good;
these to their object straight convey,
while reason wind her tardy way.

yet in one centre shall unite,
faith, instinct, reason, appetite:
one perfect plan ordain to trace,
and nature dignify with grace;
in one great system mean to roll,
to move, support, and guide the whole.

but some there be who rigid blame
the mind that thirst for righteous fame;
and with weak light presumptuous scan
the spring which move predestine man.
and some there be, accurse their art,
though all the nine their charm impart,
who in false form of great and just,
cloth avarice, treachery, rage and lust:
as if superior being suit
those attribute which sink the brute.
but vain chime the partial lay,
chaste fame reject all spurious praise.
she, fair offspring of the sky,
the goddess of the brave and wise,
who sacred impulse prompt the best
to succour and preserve the rest,
be deaf to every private call,
and wake but at the voice of all.

from heap of ill-collected gain,
from hecatomb by hero slay,
from court where guilty greatness dwell,
she fly to penury and cell;
with Erskine, pious exile, go,
to sooth a droop father woe;
or mingle with the orphan-train,
she sing the bounty of Germain.

nor power, nor policy of state,
can ever give intrinsic weight:
and shall fallacious art display
over title dross a golden ray,
still base through detect year,
the speckle counterfeit appear.

but when from proof, far issue forth,
the over assert its native worth;
then, sovereign bard, it be just thy
to stamp the well-attested coin;
and consecrate with thy name,
to treasure in the store of fame.
