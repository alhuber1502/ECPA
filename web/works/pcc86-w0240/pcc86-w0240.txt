SONG.

I.

TO those shades with delight I could fly,
 How tasteless the town is to me;
 In every gay scene that I try. 
My thoughts they but wander to thee. 

II.

Why remind me of those happy days? 
Here is nothing but dress and vain shew,
 Of those banks where I sung my first lays,
 And remark'd every flower as it grew? 

III.

Tho' we crowd the dull walks every night,
 Where's the careless sweet ease I enjoy'd;
 Not the beaux nor the belles e'er so bright;
 On these shades are my thoughts still employ'd. 

IV.

Sweet shades! where with silence or â€” thee,
 My mind every thought could approve;
 Sweet shades! I admire every tree,
 And I fly to the friend whom I love.
