winter,

a dirge.

i 

the wintery west extend his blast,
 and hail and rain do blaw;
 or, the stormy north send drive forth,
 the blind sleet and snow:
 while, tumble brown, the burn come down,
 and roar from bank to brae;
 and bird and beast, in covert, rest,
 and pass the heartless day. 

ii.

 'the sweep blast, the sky overcast,
 the joyless winter-day,
 let other fear, to i more dear,
 than all the pride of may:
 the tempest howl, it soothe my soul,
 my grief it seem to join;
 the leafless tree my fancy please,
 their fate resemble mine! 

iii.

thou power supreme, who mighty scheme,
 these woe of i fulfil;
 here, firm, i rest, they must be best,
 because they be thy will! 
then all i want (oh, do thou grant
 this one request of i!) 
since to enjoy thou do deny,
 assist i to resign!
