platonic love.

i 

so angel love and all the rest be dross,
 contract, selfish, sensitive and gross. 
unlike to this, all free and unconfined,
 be that bright flame i bear thy bright mind. 

ii.

no straggle wish, or symptom of desire,
 come near the limit of this holy fire;
 yet it be intense and active, though so fine;
 for all my pure immortal part be thy. 

iii.

why shall i then the heavenly spark controul,
 since there be no bright ray in all my soul,
 why shall i blush to indulge the noble flame,
 for which even friendship a degrade name. 

iv.

nor be the greatness of my love to thou,
 a sacrilege unto the deity,
 can i the entice stream almost adore,
 and not respect its lovely fountain more?
