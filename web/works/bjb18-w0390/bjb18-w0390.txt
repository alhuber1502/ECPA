A NURSERY LESSON (DEVOTIONAL).

SAY, little child, who gives to thee
 Thy life and limbs, so light and free? 
Thy moving eyes to look around,
 Thy ears to catch the softest sound? 
Thy food and clothing, friends and home? 
'Tis God from whom those blessings come;
 And what shouldst thou do? canst thou guess? 
To prove to Him thy thankfulness
 For life and friends, for clothes and food? â€”
 "Be good." 

And tell me, little-one, I pray,
 Who gives thee pleasure in thy play? 
Who makes the happy girl and boy
 To run, and leap, and shout for joy,
 When looking on the clear blue sky;
 The clouds, that float, the birds that fly;
 Trees, flowers, and every pretty thing? 
'Tis God from whom those blessings spring;
 And in return what shouldst thou do? 
 "Be good, and love Him too."
