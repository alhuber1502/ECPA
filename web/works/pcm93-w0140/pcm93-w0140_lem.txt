to hope.

delusive companion of youth,
 who, careless of present and past,
 in prospect, unmindful of truth,
 can flatter the wretch to the last! 

benignant deceiver, who sway
 alone can life pilgrimage glad,
 who presence make misery gay,
 and who absence prosperity sad! 

say, where do thou love to reside,
 humanity woe to assuage? 
youth sanguine pursuit do thou guide,
 or soften the rigour of age? 

or do thou with piety join,
 the pillow of sickness to smooth,
 on the breast of the die recline,
 and their fear by thy promise sooth? 

do thou tell they how vain each desire,
 which sadden die child of clay? 
and the cheer reflection inspire,
 that death to true life lead the way? 

if such thou will visit my breast,
 come, friendly enchantress, ah come â€”
 this heart of each weakness divest,
 and fix its pursuit past the tomb!
