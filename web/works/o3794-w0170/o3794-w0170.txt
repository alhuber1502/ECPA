THE MODERN PATRIOT.

REBELLION is my theme all day,
 I only wish 'twould come
 (As who knows but perhaps it may)
 A little nearer home. 

2.

Yon roaring boys who rave and fight
 On t'other side the Atlantic,
 I always held them in the right,
 But most so, when most frantic. 

3.

When lawless mobs insult the court,
 That man shall be my toast,
 If breaking windows be the sport
 Who bravely breaks the most. 

4.

But oh! for him my fancy culls
 The choicest flow'rs she bears,
 Who constitutionally pulls
 Your house about your ears. 

5.

Such civil broils are my delight,
 Tho' some folks can't endure 'em,
 Who say the mob are mad outright,
 And that a rope must cure 'em. 

6.

A rope! I wish we patriots had
 Such strings for all who need 'em â€”
 What! hang a man for going mad? 
Then farewell British freedom.
