the modern patriot.

rebellion be my theme all day,
 i only wish it will come
 (as who know but perhaps it may)
 a little near home. 

2. 

yond roar boy who rave and fight
 on other side the atlantic,
 i always hold they in the right,
 but most so, when most frantic. 

3. 

when lawless mob insult the court,
 that man shall be my toast,
 if break window be the sport
 who brave break the most. 

4. 

but oh! for he my fancy cull
 the choice flower she bear,
 who constitutional pull
 your house about your ear. 

5. 

such civil broil be my delight,
 though some folk can endure they,
 who say the mob be mad outright,
 and that a rope must cure they. 

6. 

a rope! i wish we patriot have
 such string for all who need they â€”
 what! hang a man for go mad? 
then farewell british freedom.
