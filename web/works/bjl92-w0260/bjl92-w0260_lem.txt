give to a lady who ask i to write a poem. 

in royal anna golden day,
 hard be the task to gain the bay:
 hard be it then the hill to climb;
 some break a neck, some lose a limb. 
the votary for poetic fame,
 get off decrepit, blind, and lame:
 except that little fellow pope,
 few ever then get near its top:
 and Homer crutch he may thank,
 or down the brae he will get a clank. 

swift, Thomson, ADDISON, and young
 make Pindus echo to their tongue,
 in hope to please a learned age;
 but doctor Johnston, in a rage,
 unto posterity do show
 their blunder great, their beauty few. 
but now he be dead, we well may ken;
 for ilk dunce must have a pen,
 to write in uncouth rhyme;
 and yet forsooth they please the time. 

a ploughman chiel, Rab burns his name,
 pretend to write; and think no shame
 to souse his sonnet on the court;
 and what be strange, they praise he for it. 
even folk, wha're of the high station,
 call he the glory of our nation. 

but what be more surprise still,
 a milkmaid must take up her quill;
 and she will write, shame fa' the rabble! 
that think to please with ilk bauble. 
they may thank heaven, old Sam asleep:
 for can he once but get a peep,
 he, with a vengeance will have they sen'
 of headlong to the dunces den. 

yet burns, i be tell, can write with ease,
 and all denomination please;
 can with uncommon glee impart
 a useful lesson to the heart;
 can ilk latent thought expose,
 and nature trace wherever she go:
 of politics can talk with skill,
 nor dare the critic blame his quill. 

but then a rustic country quean
 to write â€“ be ever the like of it see? 
a milk maid poem-book to print;
 more fit she will have she dairy tent;
 or labour at her spin wheel,
 and do she wark both swift and well. 
from that she may some profit share,
 but will from her rhyme ware. 
do she, poor silly thing, pretend
 the manner of our age to mend? 
mad as we be, we be wise enough
 still to despise such paltry stuff. 

 "may she who write, of wit get more,
 and all that read a ample share
 of candour every fault to screen,
 that in her dogg'ral scrawl be see." 

all this and more, a critic say;
 i hear and slink behind the shade:
 so much i dread their cruel spite,
 my hand still tremble when i write.
