virtue.

bloom beauty, brilliant wit,
 shall with life short moment flit:
 bright virtue must endure
 everlasting and secure. 
that shall gild our solemn hour,
 strew our thorny path with flower,
 dry affliction rise tear,
 ease the mind of every fear. 
even to our late breath,
 in the cold embrace of death,
 when each hope of life shall fail,
 when the quiver lip grow pale,
 when the languid pulse beat low,
 when the cheek forget to glow,
 when the heavy eye be close,
 and once-busy frame compose;
 even then shall virtue voice
 bid the christian soul rejoice;
 bid she look beyond the gloom
 of the dread-inspiring tomb,
 wrap in shade of endless night,
 to the realm of last light,
 where a saviour boundless love
 death for ever shall remove.
