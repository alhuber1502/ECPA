ABSOLUTION.

By the Same.

IT blew an hard storm, and in utmost confusion
The sailors all hurried to get absolution;
Which done, and the weight of the sins they'd confess'd,
Was transfer'd, as they thought, from themselves to the priest
To lighten the ship, and conclude their devotion,
They toss'd the poor parson souse into the ocean.
