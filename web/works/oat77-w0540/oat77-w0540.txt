Amor Sepulchralis.

IN a Large stately Cave (of old the Court
Of Rurall Gods as neighbring Swains report)
Interr'd the dear Remains of Damon lay,
Converted now to their Originall clay.
Each wishing Nymph the living Swain approv'd,
The Shepherd fair Emmoria only Lov'd.
Their mutuall Passion's Kindling Flame was more
Then ere Inspir'd Consenting Hearts before;
But was with time Improv'd to that Degree,
That now 'twas Love no more, but Extasie. 
Their linkt Affections Fate cou'd not divorce,
Nor Rig'rous Death restrain their Entercourse:
The Nymph to living Swains did still preferr
Her Damon's Dust, and ev'n that Dust Lov'd Her. 
At Damon's Tomb the Chast Emmoria kept
Perpetual Watch, and ore his Ashes wept;
(Fitt emblem of her grief) a sprigg of Yew
She planted there, the Branch took Root and grew.
This Cave to the Suns Rays Access deny'd,
No Rain or Dew the thirsting Plant Supply'd,
Yet still it sprang, by Love's Miracu'lous Pow'r,
For th' Ashes still Glow'd with their Old Amour
Emmoria's Eyes wept a nere-Ceasing Shower;
This Heat and Moysture kept the Plant Alive,
And Tempring still each other, made it Thrive.
