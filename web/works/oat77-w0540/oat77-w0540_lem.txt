Amor sepulchralis.

in a large stately cave (of old the court
of rural god as neighbour swain report)
inter the dear remains of Damon lie,
convert now to their original clay.
each wish nymph the live Swain approve,
the shepherd fair Emmoria only love.
their mutual passion kindle flame be more
then ere inspire consent heart before;
but be with time improve to that degree,
that now it be love no more, but ecstasy. 
their link affection fate can not divorce,
nor rigurous death restrain their intercourse:
the nymph to live swain do still prefer
her damon dust, and even that dust love Her.  
at damon tomb the chaste Emmoria keep
perpetual watch, and over his ash weep;
(fit emblem of her grief) a sprig of yew
she plant there, the branch take root and grow.
this cave to the sun ray access deny,
no rain or dew the thirst plant supply,
yet still it spring, by love miracu'lous power,
for the ash still glow with their old amour
emmoria eye weep a never-ceasing shower;
this heat and moisture keep the plant alive,
and tempere still each other, make it thrive.
