[Hymn II.] GLORY to the FATHER and the SON, &c.

Long Metre.

TO GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON,
 And GOD the SPIRIT, Three in One;
 Be Honour, Praise and Glory giv'n,
 By all on Earth, and all in Heav'n. 

Common Metre.

NOW let the FATHER and the SON,
 And SPIRIT be ador'd,
 Where there are Works to make Him known,
 Or Saints to love the LORD. 

Short Metre.

GIVE to the FATHER Praise,
 Give Glory to the SON;
 And to the SPIRIT of his Grace
 Be equal Honour done,
