ANOTHER [Reasonable Affliction].

Her Eye-brow-Box one Morning lost,
 (The best of Folks are oft'nest crost)
 Sad Helen thus to Jenny said,
 Her careless but afflicted Maid;
 Put me to Bed then, wretched Jane:
 Alas! when shall I rise again? 
I can behold no Mortal now:
 For what's an Eye without a Brow?
