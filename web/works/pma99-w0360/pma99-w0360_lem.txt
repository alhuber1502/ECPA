hymn.

the lord be my shepherd, what then shall i fear? 
what danger can frighten i while he be near? 
not when the day come that i pass through the vale
 of the shadow of death, shall my heart ever fail. 
though afraid by myself to pursue the dark way,
 thy rod and thy staff be my comfort and stay;
 for i know by the guidance, when once it be past,
 to a fountain of life it will lead i at last,

the lord be become my salvation and song,
 his blessing shall follow i all my life long;
 whatever condition he place i in,
 i know it be the best it can ever have be,
 for the lord he be good and his mercy be sure,
 he only afflict in order to cure;
 the lord will i praise while i have any breath,
 be content all my life, and resign at my death,
