O THERE IS NOT A SHARPER DART.

O THERE is not a sharper dart
 Can pierce the mourner's suffering heart,
 Than when the friend we love and trust
 Tramples that friendship into dust, —
 Forgets the sacred, honour'd claim,
 And proves it but an empty name! 

I almost as a sister lov'd thee,
 And thought that nothing could have mov'd thee! 
But, like the dewdrops on a spray
 That shrinks before the morning ray, —
 Like the frail sunshine on the stream,
 Thy friendship faded as a dream. 

When sickness and when sorrow tried me,
 Thy aid — thy friendship was denied me;
 Thy love was but a summer flower,
 And could not stand the wintry shower:
 More for thyself than me I grieve
 Thou could'st thus cruelly deceive.
