JESUS THE Only SAVIOUR.

I.

ADAM, our Head, our Father fell,
 And Justice doom'd the Race to Hell:
 The fiery Law speaks all Despair,
 There's no Reprieve, nor Pardon there. 

II.

Call a bright Council in the Skies:
 "Seraphs, the Mighty and the Wise,
" Say, what Expedient can you give
 "That Sin be damn'd and Sinners live? 

III.

 "Speak, are you strong to bear the Load,
" The weighty Vengeance of a God? 
 "Which of you loves our wretched Race,
" Or dares to venture in our Place? 

IV.

In vain we ask: For all around
 Stands Silence thro' the Heavenly Ground:
 There's not a glorious Mind above
 Has half the Strength, or half the Love. 

V.

But, O unutterable Grace! 
Th' Eternal Son takes Adam's place;
 Down to our World the Saviour flies,
 Stretches his naked Arms and Dies. 

VI.

Justice was pleas'd to bruise the God,
 And pay its Wrongs with Heavenly Blood;
 Infinite Racks and Pangs He bore,
 And rose. The Law could ask no more. 

VII.

Amazing Work! Look down, ye Skies,
 Wonder and gaze with all your Eyes,
 Ye Heavenly Thrones stoop from above,
 And bow to this Mysterious Love. 

VIII.

See, how they bend! See, how they look! 
Long they had read th' Eternal Book,
 And study'd dark Decrees in vain,
 The Cross and Calvary makes them plain. 

IX.

Now they are struck with deep Amaze,
 Each with his Wings conceals his Face;
 Now clap their sounding Plumes, and cry,
 "The Wisdom of a Diety. 

X.

Low they adore th' Incarnate Son,
 And sing the Glories he hath won,
 Sing how he broke our Iron Chains,
 How deep he sunk, how high he reigns. 

XI.

Triumph and reign Victorious Lord,
 By all thy flaming Saints ador'd;
 And say, dear Conqueror, say, how long
 'Ere we shall fly to joyn their Song? 

XII.

Lo, from afar the promis'd Day
 Shines with a well-distinguish'd Ray:
 But my wing'd Passion hardly bears
 These tedious Rounds of rolling Years. 

XIII.

Send down a Chariot from above
 With fiery Wheels, and pav'd with Love;
 Raise me beyond th' Ethereal Blue,
 To Sing and Love as Angels do.
