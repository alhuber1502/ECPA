the young man resolution. 

by Cupid and Bacchus i be sad perplex,
 both party to hear i incline:
 the urchin for ever comment on this text,
 beware of the juice of the vine. 

then Bacchus appear, with a cup in his hand,
 say, "drink, and you will drown every care;
 but mind, ere you taste, i will a promise demand,
 that you fly from the lip of the fair." 

o, sad the dilemma! pray, what must i do? 
with Bacchus i never can part:
 ah! dear little god, if neglect by you,
 it will rend every string of my heart. 

o why such a pother? i have find out a way,
 i will bind myself fast by a oath,
 while life warm my breast, each his power shall display,
 and i will henceforth be loyal to both.
