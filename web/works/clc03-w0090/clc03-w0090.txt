SONG. 

1.

When Daphne first her Shepherd saw,
A sudden Trembling seiz'd her;
Honour her wandring Looks did awe,
She durst not view what pleas'd her.

2.

When at her Feet he sighing lay,
She found her Heart complying;
Yet wou'd not to her Love give way,
To save her Swain from dying.

3.

The little God stood laughing by
To see her dextrous feigning;
He bid the blushing Fair comply,
The Shepherd leave complaining.
