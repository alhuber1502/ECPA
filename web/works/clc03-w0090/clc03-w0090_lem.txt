song. 

1. 

when Daphne first her shepherd see,
a sudden tremble seize she;
honour she wander look do awe,
she dare not view what please she.

2. 

when at her foot he sigh lie,
she find her heart comply;
yet will not to her love give way,
to save she Swain from die.

3. 

the little god stand laugh by
to see her dextrous feign;
he bid the blush fair comply,
the shepherd leave complain.
