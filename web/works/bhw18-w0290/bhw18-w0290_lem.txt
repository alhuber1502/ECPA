sonnet

to the strawberry.

the strawberry bloom upon its lowly bed,
 plant of my native soil! — the lime may fling
 more potent fragrance on the zephyr wing,
 the milky cocoa rich juice shed,
 the white guava lovely blossom spread —
 but not, like thou, to fond remembrance bring
 the vanish hour of life enchant spring;
 short calendar of joy for ever flee! 
thou bid the scene of childhood rise to view,
 the wild wood-path which fancy love to trace;
 where, veil in leaf, thy fruit of rosy hue
 lurk on its pliant stem with modest grace. 
but ah! when thought will late year renew,
 alas, successive sorrow crowd the space!
