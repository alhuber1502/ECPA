sweetness:

a ode.

inscribe to Cleora.

by mr. Robertson.

of damask cheek, and radiant eye,
 let other poet tell;
 within the bosom of the fair,
 superior beauty dwell. 

there all the sprightly power of wit
 in blithe assemblage play;
 there every social virtue shed
 its intellectual ray. 

but, as the sun refulgent light
 heaven wide expanse refine,
 with sovereign lustre, through the soul,
 celestial sweetness shine. 

this mental beam dilate the heart,
 and sparkle in the face;
 it harmonise every thought,
 and heighten every grace. 

one glimpse can sooth the trouble breast,
 the heave sigh restrain;
 can make the bed of sickness please,
 and stop the sense of pain. 

its power can charm the savage heart,
 the tyrant pity move;
 to smile convert the wild rage,
 and melt the soul to love. 

when sweetness beam upon the throne,
 in majesty benign,
 the awful splendor of a crown
 with mild lustre shine. 

in scene of poverty and woe,
 where melancholy dwell,
 the influence of this live ray
 the dreary gloom dispel. 

thus, when the bloom spring return,
 to cheer the mournful plain,
 through earth and air, with genial warmth,
 etherial mildness reign. 

beneath its bright, auspicious beam,
 no boisterous passion rise;
 moroseness quit the peaceful scene,
 and baleful discord fly. 

a thousand nameless beauty spring,
 a thousand virtue glow;
 a smile train of joy appear,
 and endless blessing flow. 

unbounded charity display
 her sympathize charm;
 and friendship pure seraphic flame
 the generous bosom warm. 

almighty love exert his power,
 and spread, with secret art,
 a soft sensation through the frame,
 a transport through the heart. 

nor shall the storm of age, which cloud
 each gleam of sensual joy;
 and blast the gaudy flower of pride,
 these bless effect destroy. 

when that fair form shall sink in year,
 and all those grace fly;
 the beauty of thy heavenly mind
 shall length of day defy.
