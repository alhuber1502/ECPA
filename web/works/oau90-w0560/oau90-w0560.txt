A Catch in Three Parts, set by Mr. Hen. Purcel, and taken from the Latin of BUCHANAN.

I.

YOung Collin cleaving of a Beam,
At every thumping Blow, cry'd Hem;
And told his Wife, who the Cause would know,
'Twas Hem, made th' Wedge much farther go.

II.

Plump Ioan, at Night when t' Bed she came,
And both were playing at that same;
Cry'd, Hem, Hem, Hem, prithee Collin do,
If ever thou lov'dst me Hem, Hem now.

III.

No, no, no, no, sweet Wife, no no,
Some Wood will split with half a blow;
Besides I Bore, now, now, I Bore,
I Hem when I Cleave, but now I Bore.
