sonnet.

as near i approach that fatal day
 which make all mortal care appear so light,
 time seem on swift wing to speed his flight,
 and hope fallacious vision fade away;
 while to my fond desire, at length, i say,
 behold, how quick melt from your sight
 the promise object you esteem so bright,
 when love be all your song, and life look gay! 
now let we rest in peace! those hour be past,
 and with they, all the agitate train
 by which hope lead the wander cheat soul;
 weary, she seek repose, and own at last
 how sigh, and tear, and youth, be spend in vain,
 while languish she mourn in folly sad control.
