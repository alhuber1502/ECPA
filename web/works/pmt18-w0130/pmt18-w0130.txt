Sonnet.

As nearer I approach that fatal day
 Which makes all mortal cares appear so light,
 Time seems on swifter wing to speed his flight,
 And Hope's fallacious visions fade away;
 While to my fond desires, at length, I say,
 Behold, how quickly melted from your sight
 The promised objects you esteemed so bright,
 When love was all your song, and life looked gay! 
Now let us rest in peace! those hours are past,
 And with them, all the agitating train
 By which hope led the wandering cheated soul;
 Wearied, she seeks repose, and owns at last
 How sighs, and tears, and youth, were spent in vain,
 While languishing she mourned in folly's sad control.
