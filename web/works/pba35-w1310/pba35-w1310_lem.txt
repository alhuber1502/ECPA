on see the captive, late redeem from barbary by his majesty.

a sight like this, who can unmoved survey? 
impartial Muse, can thou withhold thy lay? 
see the free captive hail their native shore,
 and tread the land of liberty once more:
 see, as they pass, the crowd people press,
 joy in their joy, and their dellv'rer bless. 

now, slavery! no more thy rigid hand
 shall drag the trader to thy fatal strand:
 no more in iron bond the wretched groan;
 secure, Britannia, by thy guardian throne. 

say, mighty prince! can empire boast a bliss,
 amid its radiant pomp, that equal this? 
to see the captive by thy power set free,
 their supplication raise to heaven for thou! 

the god like bounty scatter blessing round;
 as flow urn enrich the distant ground:
 no more shall woe the faint heart destroy;
 the house of mourning now be turn to joy:
 see arm in grief long fold up, extend,
 to clasp a husband, brother, kinsman, friend:
 see hoary parent, totter over the grave,
 a son long-wailed, to prop their age, receive:
 and, have we live to see thy face? they cry;
 o! it be enough â€” we now in peace shall die:
 o bless be heaven! and bless, while life remain. 
shall be the hand, that have unbind thy chain! 

forbear, my muse; know art attempt in vain,
 what nature picture to the breast humane. 

to wager turn; for wager raise thy voice;
 to feed the hungry, long have be his choice,
 and make the heart, bear down by care, rejoice. 

say, you luxurious, who indulge your taste,
 and, by one riot, may a thousand feast;
 do you not blush to see his care to feed
 the captive by your monarch bounty free? 

the bitter cup of slavery be past;
 but pine penury approach fast. 

and shall the royal rage alone bestow? 
shall not compassion from the subject flow? 
shall not each free-born briton bosom melt,
 to make the joy of liberty more feel? 
so, Albion, be it ever give to thou,
 to break the bond, and set the prisoner free
