though faint shine this winter sun,
and short his visit be,
he warm my heart, for oft i hope,
he shine on you and i.

the moon too, beauteous queen of night,
enrapture still i see;
for sure i think her ray serene,
be see by you and i.

and gay burn our rural fire,
and happy shall i be,
but cold my heart, there want a charm,
it warm not you and i.

and fierce blow this cold north wind,
for ruffian blast have he;
but bitter far that zephyr breeze,
which part you and i.
