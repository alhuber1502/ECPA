volunteer song,

write in 1803. 

you who britain soldier be, â€”
 Freemen, child of the free,
 who quick come at danger call,
 from shop and palace, cot and hall,
 and brace you brave up in warlike gear,
 for all that you hold dear;

bless in your hand be sword and spear! 
there be no banded briton here
 on who some fond mate have not smile,
 or hang in love some lisp child,
 or age parent, grasp his last stay,
 with lock of honour grey. 

such man behold with steady pride,
 the threaten tempest gather wide,
 and list with onward form incline,
 to sound of foeman on the wind,
 and brave act amid the battle roar,
 in scene untried before. 

let veteran boast, as well they may,
 nerve steel in many a bloody day;
 the generous heart, who take his stand
 upon his free and native land,
 do, with the first sound of the hostile drum,
 a fearless man become. 

then come, you host, that mad pour
 from wave-tossed float upon our shore! 
if fell or gentle, false or true,
 let those inquire, who wish to sue:
 nor fiend nor hero from a foreign strand,
 shall lord it in our land. 

come, then, you host that mad pour
 from wave-tossed float upon our shore! 
a adverse wind or breezeless main
 lock in their port our tar detain,
 to waste their eager spirit, vain keen,
 else here you have not be. 

yet nevertheless, in strong array,
 prepare you for a well-fought day. 
let banner wave and trumpet sound,
 and close cohort darken round,
 and the fierce onset raise its mingle roar,
 new sound on England shore! 

Freemen, child of the free,
 be brave alike on land or sea;
 and every rood of british ground
 on which a hostile spear be find,
 prove under their firm tread and vigorous stroke,
 a deck of royal oak.
