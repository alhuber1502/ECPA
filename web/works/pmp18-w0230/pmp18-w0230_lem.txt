to cloe weep.

see, while thou weep, fair cloe, see
 the world in sympathy with thou. 
the cheerful bird no long sing,
 each drop his head, and hang his wing. 
the cloud have bend their bosom low,
 and shed their sorrow in a shower. 
the brook beyond their limit flow;
 and loud murmur speak their woe. 
the nymph and swain adopt thy care:
 they heave thy sigh, and weep thy tear. 
fantastic nymph! that grief shall move
 thy heart, obdurate against love. 
strange tear! who power can soften all,
 but that dear breast on which they fall.
