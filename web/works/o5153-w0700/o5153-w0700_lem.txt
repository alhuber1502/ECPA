the triumph of indifference.

be the same ode,

imitate by a unknown hand.

i 

thanks, dear coquet! indulgent cheat!
kind heaven, and your more kind deceit,
at length have set i free;
no more i sigh, and dote, and pine,
all ease without, and calm within,
in peace and liberty.

ii.

Cupid no more have power to scorch,
time sure have rob he of his torch,
never be a cool creature:
that name no more have such eclat,
no more my heart go pit-a-pat
at sight of each dear feature.

iii.

i sleep at night, and sometime dream,
nor you the fond vexatious theme;
i wake, nor think about you:
i meet, i leave you, meet again,
but feel no mighty joy or pain,
or with you, or without you.

iv.

now with indifference i chat
of eye, lip, bubby, and all that,
and laugh at former folly:
joke with my rival when we meet,
what eye so keen! what lip so sweet!
what skin so soft as Molly!

v. 

leave then those little torture art,
you practise on comply heart;
they be all in vain, believe i:
whether those eye look kind or weep,
the pout, or the smile lip,
will neither please, nor grieve i.

vi.

from those despotic look, no more
(once tyrant of each sickle hour)
i date my grief and joy:
may, though you frown, look sweet clad;
and dull December mighty sad,
though you stand smile by.

vii.

yet still (for i be quite sincere)
you be mighty pretty, â€” true, my dear,
but, like your pretty sex,
you have here and there, and now and then
a fail; for like other man,
i now can spy defect.

viii.

yet once with coward fondness curse,
my poor weak heart i fear will burst
at thought of separation:
but now despise my feeble chain,
and bless the salutary pain
that cure i of my passion.

ix.

impatient of his iron cage,
the bird thus spend his little rage,
and escape with shatter wing:
but soon with new-fledged pinion soar,
and hasten to his native bower,
a joyful welcome sing.

x. 

fond female vanity will say,
these long harangue they sure betray
a heart that be hanker still:
this passion so proclaim in song,
this tale so please to the tongue,
do it not touch the will?

xi.

lover like soldier, Molly, dwell
with pleasure on the horrid tale,
when all the danger over:
like other slave from fetter free,
we smile with anxious joy, to see
the chain which once we wear.

xii.

in kind indulgence to a heart,
engage in so severe a part,
this sweet revenge i write:
rail, weep, be woman all, for i
lull in indifference, defy
your fondness or your spite.

xiii.

a frail false maid i lose, but you
a man, fond, generous, and true;
which fortune be the worse?
try all love be mighty empire round,
a faithful lover seldom find;
a jilt a common curse.
