on a sermon preach Sept. the 6th, 1697. on these word, you have sell your self for nought. 

with Grotius on new-testament you have do,
 and choose authentic coke and Littleton;
 the latter tenure do inspire your brain,
 to vent your self in legislative strain:
 where you each nice distinction do pursue,
 the bargain, sale, and the habendum too. 
it be not do by lease or mortgage then,
 to be redeem as you tell how and when;
 by deed of feoffment we have pass away,
 for nothing too our tenement of clay;
 and that the devil who the purchase buy,
 he nothing give nor nothing have he get. 
on this you cant (awhile) at last recall,
 cum pertinentiis, he have get all;
 when of the gospel you make law take place,
 statue may well get upperhand of grace:
 sure you the primitive design have mist,
 Joshua must yield to a evangelist. 
but Littleton in you have get the start,
 do know if thou in church or temple be it? 
though you so zealous the non-cons hate,
 methinks too like the Pro and con you prate,
 the sermon be at best but a debate:
 instead of proof you bring we Presidents,
 need more the judge than the saint consent. 
you declare, plead, join issue or demur,
 then sell at last with (come ceo sur;)
 fatal defeazance, for if you preach so,
 your hearer may remain in Statu quo:
 so far you on the legal right intrench,
 we scarce know your pulpit from the bench.
