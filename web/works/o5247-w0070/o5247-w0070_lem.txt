to moneses sing.

be hush as death, moneses sing,
 moneses strike the sound string;
 let sacred silence dwell around,
 and nought disturb the magic sound;
 let not the soft whisper breeze
 sob amid the rustle tree;
 murmur, you plaintive stream, no more,
 but glide in silence to the shore:
 even philomel thy note suspend,
 and to a sweet song attend;
 ah! soft, ah! dangerous, powerful charm,
 a angel voice, a angel form;
 attentive to the heavenly lay,
 i hear and gaze my soul away;
 now tender wish, melt fire,
 infant pain, and young desire,
 steal into my soften soul,
 and bend it to the sweet controul;
 yet, let i fly, ever it be too late,
 the sweet disease, and shun my fate. 
but ah! that soft, die strain
 arrest my step, i strive in vain. 
again i to the siren turn,
 again with gentle fire i burn;
 cease lovely youth the enchant sound,
 too deep already be the wound;
 through all my vein the poison steal,
 my heart the dear infection feel:
 i faint, i die, by love oppress,
 the sigh scarce heave my pant breast;
 before my view dim shadow rise,
 and hide thou from my ravish eye:
 thy voice, like distant sound, i hear,
 it die in murmur on my ear:
 in the too powerful transport tost,
 even think, and every sense be lose.
