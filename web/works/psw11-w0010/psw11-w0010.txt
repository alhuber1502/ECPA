VERSES Wrote in a LADY'S Ivory Table-Book. 

Anno. 1698.

PERUSE my Leaves thro' ev'ry Part,
 And think thou seest my owners Heart,
 Scrawl'd o'er with Trifles thus, and quite
 As hard, as sensless, and as light:
 Expos'd to every Coxcomb's Eyes,
 But hid with Caution from the Wise. 
Here you may read (Dear Charming Saint)
 Beneath (A new Receit for Paint)
 Here in Beau-spelling (tru tel deth)
 There in her own (far an el breth)
 Here (lovely Nymph pronounce my doom)
 There (A safe way to use Perfume)
 Here, a Page fill'd with Billet Doux;
 On t'other side (laid out for Shoes)
 (Madam, I dye without your Grace)
 (Item, for half a Yard of Lace.) 
Who that had Wit would place it here,
 For every peeping Fop to Jear. 
To think that your Brains Issue is
 Expos'd to th' Excrement of his,
 In power of Spittle and a Clout
 When e're he please to blot it out;
 And then to heighten the Disgrace
 Clap his own Nonsence in the place. 
Whoe're expects to hold his part
 In such a Book and such a Heart,
 If he be Wealthy and a Fool
 Is in all Points the fittest Tool,
 Of whom it may be justly said,
 He's a Gold Pencil tipt with Lead.
