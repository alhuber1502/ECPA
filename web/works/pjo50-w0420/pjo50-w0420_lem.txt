 "go, Betty, (gentle Delia say)
 and warm my spotless virgin bed:
 i be frost, i be ice, all cold as stone! 
but how can one be warm alone? 
well, be it so — what can be cure,
 the proverb say, must be endure. 
stay — go, i mean — but on my chair
 Besure lie Farquhar constant pair. 
my psalm and hymn, here, take away,
 methinks i have no great mind to pray:
 soft vigil rather let i keep;
 Damon, alas! have murder sleep". 

she say, when lo! a storm arise,
 which first her favourite discompose:
 her china next disorder shake,
 and see! the chimney, how it quake! 
the palace totter to its fall,
 and down come china, chimney, all! 
what shall she do? or whither run? 
behold in dust her bed of down! 
yet, Delia, let it never be say,
 you know not where to lay your head. 
what! shrink back, now danger near! 
a soldier daughter too, and fear! 
where, where be that fortitude you boast? 
the post of danger virtue post:
 and thunder, lighten, rain, or shine,
 the bed of honour still be thy.

down the pretty purling stream
 the little love may loll and dream;
 and please, and prune themselves with care,
 and fancy virtue lodge there. 
the soft affection thus, and strong,
 down life current glide along;
 and all-appeased and uncontrolled,
 a while their equal measure hold. 
till sail farther on the deep,
 or mount virtue lofty steep,
 the pretty system sink away,
 the little love, and smile decay. 
unnumbered wave and storm we find
 to raise — not to depress the mind,
 the conscious mind, which dare endure,
 and, fix on virtue, stand, secure:
 nor shrink, dismay, when danger nigh,
 nor drop her aim beneath the sky.
