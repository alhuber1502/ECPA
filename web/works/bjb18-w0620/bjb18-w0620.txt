SONG,

(FOR A SCOTCH AIR.)

O SWIFTLY glides the bonny boat
 Just parted from the shore,
 And, to the fisher's chorus note,
 Soft moves the dipping oar! 
His toils are borne with lightsome cheer,
 And ever may they speed,
 Who feeble age and helpmates dear,
 And tender bairnies feed. 

CHORUS.

We cast our lines in Largo Bay,
 Our nets are floating wide,
 Our bonny boat with yielding sway
 Rocks lightly on the tide;
 And happy prove our daily lot,
 Upon the summer sea! 
And blest on land our kindly cot,
 Where all our treasures be! 

The Mermaid on her rock may sing,
 The Witch may weave her charm,
 Nor Water-Sprite, nor eldrich thing
 The bonny boat can harm. 
It safely bears its scaly store
 Through many a stormy gale,
 While joyful shouts rise from the shore,
 Its homeward prow to hail. 

CHORUS.
