song,

(for a scotch air.)

o swift glide the bonny boat
 just part from the shore,
 and, to the fisher chorus note,
 soft move the dip oar! 
his toil be bear with lightsome cheer,
 and ever may they speed,
 who feeble age and helpmate dear,
 and tender bairny feed. 

chorus.

we cast our line in largo bay,
 our net be float wide,
 our bonny boat with yield sway
 rock light on the tide;
 and happy prove our daily lot,
 upon the summer sea! 
and bless on land our kindly cot,
 where all our treasure be! 

the mermaid on her rock may sing,
 the witch may weave her charm,
 nor water-sprite, nor eldrich thing
 the bonny boat can harm. 
it safe bear its scaly store
 through many a stormy gale,
 while joyful shout rise from the shore,
 its homeward prow to hail. 

chorus.
