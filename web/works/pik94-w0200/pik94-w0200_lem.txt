epitaph on a favourite tame chicken.

beneath this stone a chicken lay,
 her mistress name she Bess,
 six month she tender be nurse,
 yet still she grow the less. 

in fairy hill poor Bess be hatch,
 if there she have but stay,
 she may have have a verdant grave,
 and not in dust be lay. 

but hapless chick, like this world fool,
 must wander far from home,
 and by a lady scissors fall,
 and here must fix her tomb. 

farewell! my little favourite Bess,
 thy fate why shall i mourn? 
since king and queen the same must share,
 and unto dust return.
