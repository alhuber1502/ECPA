the lily and the rose.

1. 

the nymph must lose her female friend
 if more admire than she â€”
 but where will fierce contention end
 if flower can disagree? 

2. 

within the garden peaceful scene
 appear two lovely foe,
 aspire to the rank of queen,
 the lily and the rose. 

3. 

the rose soon redden into rage,
 and swell with disdain,
 appeal to many a poet page
 to prove she right to reign. 

4. 

the lily height bespeak command,
 a fair imperial flower,
 she seem design for Flora hand,
 the sceptre of her power. 

5. 

this civil bicker and debate
 the goddess chance to hear,
 and fly to save, ever yet too late,
 the pride of the parterre. 

6. 

you be, she say, the noble hue,
 and you the stately mien,
 and until a third surpass you,
 let each be deem a queen. 
thus soothe and reconcile, each seek
 the fair british fair,
 the seat of empire be her cheek,
 they reign unite there.
