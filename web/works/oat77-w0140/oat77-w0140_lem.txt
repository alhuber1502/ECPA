the surprisal.

in the narrow walk of a close grove,
who shall i chance to meet but love? 
i seize the elf, and say — at last
i have catch thou, and i'l hold thou fast.
now by thy mother dove and sparrow,
i'l rob thou of thy bow and arrow;
i'l chain thou up and clip thy wing,
or strangle thou in thy own string,
if thou refuse i to relate
the ground of my olinda hate.
then thus the boy reply — fond Swain,
vex not your self and i in vain:
your love as noble be and brave
as ere this bow and quiver give;
but that olinda flight your flame,
nor thou, nor i, nor she be too blame.
weigh circumstance, and you will find
she be of necessity unkind:
she be mortal, therefore never can
commiserate a suffering Swain;
for such refine perfection shine
in she, that can she but incline
to pity man, she be divine!
