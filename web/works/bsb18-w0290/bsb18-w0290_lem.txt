hope.

see, from yonder hill descend,
 hope, with all her train attend! 
 "quip, and crank, and wanton wile,
 nod, and beck, and wreathe smile;"
 fancy light that tread on air,
 building fairy castle there;
 Æolus his harp new string,
 tune to the breeze sing;
 zeph'rus sweep soft chord;
 fancy set air to word;
 word that seem another sound,
 and light than a breath be find. 
here Morpheus come, a wander guest,
 by plaintive murmur lull to rest;
 round he paint vapour stream,
 weave soft the chequer dream,
 which on silken wing they spread,
 shake over his drowsy head;
 subtle fume waft round the brain,
 and fan these joy so light and vain,
 which soft slumber love to dress
 in long robe of happiness. 
see where come the dance hour,
 sprinkle hope gay path with flower;
 "thyme that love the brown hill side,"
 heath in last colour dye;
 feathery spray that soft blow,
 and lead the sweet gale as they go
 unheeded, — though the scent air
 fragrance steal we know not where. 
sweet hope! light do thou tread,
 bend not the weak flower head;
 watch every changeful scene,
 slide gild show between
 where new prospect open still,
 rise fair behind the hill. 

it be true stern reason scorn thy sway,
 nor bask beneath thy sunny ray;
 nor hear thy accent clear and sweet,
 where sprightly air and softness meet,
 mix with harmonic chord,
 pour melody on word. 
nor will his fix eye deign to glance
 on the mirthful mazy dance,
 when the hour, all hand in hand,
 link with thou, a jocund band;
 when thy white robe float on air,
 catch ray that tremble there,
 tint with the vary beam,
 end in prismatic stream. 

on thy head a wreath of flower
 nod in time to dance hour,
 feathery-footed, trim, and light,
 flit round from morn till night;
 from morn till night, thou gay lead
 through dark green wood and paint mead,
 with rose-tinged cheek, and clear blue eye
 look through another sky,
 till we reach the enamel lawn
 round which a river journey on,
 where many a bridge be teach to please
 gothic eye, or gay Chinese,
 throw in every point of view
 arch can add a beauty to,
 while here and there a ashling weave
 verdant knot of summer leave. 

now we reach thy mansion high,
 spiral turret climb the sky,
 gild cloud of vary light,
 change underneath the sight. 
see what crowd surround the gate,
 see what expectation wait;
 and, run out, surround their queen,
 ask all at once where she have be;
 and if the promise hour be find
 with elysian garland crown;
 or if yet she will leave to tell
 where true happiness will dwell;
 or yet have see the promise day
 when expectation, grave or gay,
 in happy, blissful band shall be
 unite into certainty. 

she sweet smile, and wave her hand;
 at which a specious flatter band
 (quick through the ear their credence reach)
 bow round, — and, full of soothe speech
 declare the hour will soon appear;
 then, whisper soft in the ear,
 teach smile along the cheek to glow,
 as if those hour they well do know. 

you promise! you flatterer vain! 
that dress out hope and varnish pain,
 and make the dull thing appear
 of shine surface, smooth and clear;
 hand the cup to hope sweet lip,
 of which we guest so fond sip,
 while see all the bottom shine,
 never think there be poison in the wine: —
 dark lethe cup each grief subdue,
 that use on former joy to muse;
 for to hope enchant dome
 dread ill dare never come;
 not one mask sorrow can you see
 in all her court of revelry: —
 what though you pull the careless sleeve,
 and will tempt we to believe
 these noon-joy be wane fast,
 form only for a hour to last;
 hence, miscreant! — let i, while i may,
 enjoy the gewgaw of my day. 

descend, sweet hope, from thy bright throne
 glitter with each precious stone, —
 ruby red, and sapphire blue,
 amethyst of purple hue,
 topaze of sunlike blaze,
 and diamond with their thousand ray;
 descend! and mount yond hill with i,
 there let i open prospect see,
 which, step by step, shall fair grow
 the while as fade this scene below. 
forest of immortal oak;
 rock by tumble torrent break;
 "shallow brook, and river wide,
 verdant mead, with daisy pied;"
 distant city, large and proud;
 mountain dim, that seem a cloud;
 castle high, that live on hill;
 little cot, that seek the rill;
 upland ground, where flock be see
 mix white with dark green;
 what! though paint on the air,
 still they look serene and fair. 
though my foot be leave to tread
 barren heath with bramble spread,
 yet if thou check one fall tear,
 or bathe the eye till it grow clear,
 i will free pardon all thy wile,
 and fancy good in all thy smile;
 still please to find the ill we dread
 thy fairy wing can overspread;
 and though thy promise deceive,
 bless my kind star that i believe;
 thy crank and wile who will not see! 
for happy they who doubt not thou.
