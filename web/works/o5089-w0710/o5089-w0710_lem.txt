the wolf, sheep, and lamb.

duty demand, the parent voice
 shall sanctify the daughter choice;
 in that, be due obedience show;
 to choose, belong to her alone. 

may horror seize his midnight hour,
 who build upon a parent power,
 and claim, by purchase vile and base,
 the loathe maid for his embrace;
 hence virtue sicken, and the breast,
 where peace have build her downy nest,
 become the trouble seat of care,
 and pine with anguish and despair. 
a wolf, rapacious, rough, and bold,
 who nightly plunder thin the fold,
 contemplate his ill-spent life,
 and, cloy with theft, will take a wife. 
his purpose know, the savage race,
 in numerous croud, attend the place;
 for why, a mighty wolf he be,
 and hold dominion in his jaw. 
her favourite whelp each mother bring,
 and, humble, his alliance seek;
 but cold by age, or else too nice,
 none find acceptance in his eye. 
it happen, as, at early dawn,
 he solitary cross the lawn,
 stray from the fold, a sportive lamb
 skip wanton, by her fleecy dam;
 when Cupid, foe to man and beast,
 discharge a arrow at his breast. 

the timorous breed the robber know,
 and, tremble, over the meadow fly;
 their nimble speed the wolf overtake,
 and, courteous, thus the dam bespeak. 

stay, fair, and suspend your fear;
 trust i, no enemy be near:
 these jaw, in slaughter oft imbrue,
 at length, have know enough of blood;
 and kind business bring i now,
 vanquish, at beauty foot to bow. 
you have a daughter — sweet, forgive
 a wolf address — in she i live;
 love from her eye like lightning come,
 and set my marrow all on flame;
 let your consent confirm my choice,
 and ratify our nuptial joy. 

i ample wealth and power attend,
 wide over the plain my realm extend;
 what midnight robber dare invade
 the fold, if i the guard be make? 
at home the shepherd cur may sleep,
 while i secure his master sheep. 
discourse like this attention claim;
 grandeur the mother breast inflame;
 now, fearless by his side she walk,
 of settlement and jointure talk;
 propose, and double her demand,
 of flowery field, and turnep-land,
 the wolf agree. her bosom swell;
 to miss her happy fate she tell;
 and, of the grand alliance vain,
 contemn her kindred of the plain. 

the loathe lamb with horror hear,
 and weary out her dam with prayer;
 but all in vain; mamma best know
 what unexperienced girl shall do? 
so, to the neighbour meadow carry,
 a formal ass the couple marry. 

tear from the tyrant mother side,
 the trembler go, a victim-bride,
 reluctant meet the rude embrace,
 and bleat among the howl race. 
with horror oft her eye behold
 her murder kindred of the fold;
 each day a sister lamb be serve,
 and at the glutton table carve;
 the crash bone he grind for food,
 and flake his thirst with stream blood. 

love, who the cruel mind detest,
 and lodge but in gentle breast,
 be now no more. enjoyment past,
 the savage hunger for the feast;
 but (as we find in human race,
 a mask conceal the villain face)
 justice must authorise the treat;
 till then he long, but dare not eat. 

as forth he walk, in quest of prey,
 the hunter meet he on the way;
 fear wing his flight; the marsh he seek! 
the snuff dog be set at fault. 
his stomach balk, now hunger gnaw;
 howl, he grind his empty jaw;
 food must be have — and lamb be nigh;
 his maw invoke the fraudful lie. 
be this (dissemble rage) he cry,
 the gentle virtue of a bride? 
that, league with man destroy race,
 she set her husband for the chace? 
by treachery prompt the noisy hound
 to scent his footstep on the ground? 
thou traitress vile! for this thy blood
 shall glut my rage, and die the wood! 

so say, on the lamb he fly;
 beneath his jaw the victim die.
