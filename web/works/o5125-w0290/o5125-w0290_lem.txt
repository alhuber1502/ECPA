the apparition.

from that inevitable shore,
 wheer styx tremendous water roar,
 thus winge with vengeance lo i fly,
 and skim beneath the gloomy sky. 
to you o false, o faithless fair,
 (yet tremble do — and wild stare)
 to you this angry visit be pay,
 to you once love, but faithless maid,
 perhaps (too thin for mortal eye)
 you know i not in this disguise;
 i never be number with your foe,
 but what i be now, shall not disclose
 my name (esteem by one or two)
 be Mira — while i live like you,
 till your unkindness cut the twine
 of life, before its state time. 

and shall you ask to know the end
 of she that once you call a friend? 
whether of pleurisy she die,
 or in a parch fever dry? 
or pale consumption sure and slow? 
or apoplexy sudden blow? 
it be none of these — no common dart,
 that strike my unresisting heart:
 the dire distemper you shall hear,
 then listen with attentive ear. 
do you not, ah! do you not say,
 that you will come the next fair day
 to mira dome? — rejoice to see
 at once the butterfly and i? 
but now, alas! (too late, i find)
 the promise joy of human kind,
 inconstant as the flit wind:
 you come not — that i need not tell. 
but then, o then your Mira fall,
 that fatal day expect you;
 i sweep my house, and dine by two,
 take off the nightcap from my brow,
 (o pride!) but i repent it now:
 (ambitious she i love to please)
 and, ah! too strait palace my stay;
 then silent sit betwixt hope and fear,
 with beat heart and listen ear,
 till the shrill clock have sound four;
 then wretched Mira be no more:
 her cheek put on a deathlike hue,
 her eye-ball bid this world adieu:
 and though untouched by Cupid dart,
 she perish with a break heart. 

but i have do — farewell, for i
 from this corporeal world must fly:
 so the relentless fate decree,
 once more farewell — remember i.
