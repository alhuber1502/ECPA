epitaph.

for Alexander Wedderburn, ESQ; saint Germains.

integrity
 unsullied,
 of playful fancy,
 innocence of mirth,
 belove companion,
 nor base — return tarnish
 his temper. 
the best of master; a indulge spouse;
 useful! to other:
 and
 brave out the storm! 
he feel too deep! 
yet scorn to complain. 

you friendly — gentlemanly
 upright soul,
 may no ingratitude
 thy evening
 blast:
 in sympathetic
 tear
 bedew his tomb,
 who fate
 it be.
