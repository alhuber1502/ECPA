EPITAPH.

For Alexander Wedderburn, Esq; St Germains.

Integrity
 Unsullied,
 Of playful fancy,
 Innocence of mirth,
 Beloved companion,
 Nor base — return tarnished
 His temper. 
The best of Masters; an indulging spouse;
 Useful! to others:
 And
 Braving out the storm! 
He felt too deep! 
Yet scorning to complain. 

Ye friendly — gentlemanly
 Upright souls,
 May no ingratitude
 Thy evenings
 Blast:
 In sympathetic
 Tears
 Bedew his Tomb,
 Whose fate
 It was.
