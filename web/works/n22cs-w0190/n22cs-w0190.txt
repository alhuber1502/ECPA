SONNET  XIX. To Mr. Hayley. On receiving some elegant Lines from him.

FOR me the Muse a simple band design'd
 Of 'idle' flow'rs, that bloom the woods among,
 Which with the cypress and the willow join'd,
 A garland form'd, as artless as my song:
 And little dar'd I hope its transient hours
 So long would last; compos'd of buds so brief;
 'Till Hayley's hand among the vagrant flow'rs,
 Threw from his verdant crown, a deathless leaf. 
For high in Fame's bright fane has Judgment plac'd
 The laurel wreath Serena's poet won;
 Which, wov'n with myrtles by the hands of Taste,
 The Muse decreed, for this her favourite son. 
And those immortal leaves his temples shade,
 Whose fair eternal verdure â€” shall not fade!
