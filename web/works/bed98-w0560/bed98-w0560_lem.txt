sonnet.

when first you seek my rural cot,
and find my friendship there;
Daphne, content with your lot,
you share my simple fare.

i chill you not with cold reserve,
nor wear a haughty frown;
though what your merit may deserve,
be yet to i unknown.

a cheerful welcome to impart,
i spread my little store;
and oft i raise your droop heart,
with hope of happy hour.

to you my friendship lend its aid,
and call its vigour forth;
for prosperous scene it wish display,
to unassuming worth.

it be not feed by airy dream,
nor hope for high return;
nor can it fear the hard extreme,
of hate and haughty scorn.
