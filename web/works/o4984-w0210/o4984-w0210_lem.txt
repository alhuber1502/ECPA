ode on beauty.

to ******.

by the same.

i 

and will thou, Romeo, still maintain
 that beauty hold a boundless reign,
 soft power, by all confess! 
see thou the coward and the brave,
 the free-born briton and the slave,
 with equal rapture bless? 

ii.

the god indulgent to mankind
 the tender passion of the mind
 with frugal hand dispense:
 for faithless i can never believe,
 that rude untutored heart perceive
 the fine joy of sense. 

iii.

Mark but the ruthless indian soul,
 which no ingenuous thought control,
 where pity never dwell:
 by beauty, fancy lovely child,
 amid lorn savannah waste and wild,
 with human feeling melt! 

iv.

behold the powerful charm assuage
 the hoary lion lawless rage:
 he own the wanton fire;
 and lordly roam over the plain
 single the fair of his train
 to feed the loose desire! 

v. 

but will thou feel a pure flame
 than even the warm wish can frame,
 by much too fine to cloy;
 far, far beyond that ache breast,
 with which the village-hind's oppress,
 who idle term it joy? 

vi.

have heaven indulgent to thy make
 form thou to every sense awake,
 blithe hope, or frantic fear? 
can human misery steal a sigh,
 or from thy soft consent eye
 can pity draw the tear? 

vii.

can thou with wild Othello glow
 in all his madden jealous woe,
 by love dark doubt distress? 
with treacherous jaffier do thou feel
 the impend torture of the wheel,
 that wind his guilty breast? 

viii.

tell i, can pindar lofty strain,
 luxuriant fancy fruitful vein,
 the noble thought infuse? 
say, do you taste his generous fire,
 or can thou feel expire
 to sappho plaintive muse? 

ix.

see thou the warmth, the grace divine,
 that breathe through mild correggio line,
 by heaven peculiar care:
 do Guido wrap thou in delight? 
can titian colour charm thy sight? 
or julio godlike air? 

x. 

say, do thy heart with rapture spring,
 when Handel strike the magic string,
 with transport do you hear? 
or do thou languish into pain
 when soft corelli tender strain
 subdue the ravish ear? 

xi.

can thou with freedom son rejoice
 to hear the athenian patriot voice
 amid tyrant undismayed;
 but fail his bold fire â€” o say,
 can Tully charm each sense away,
 and baffle reason aid? 

xii.

can thou with pity move bewail
 the simple Emma hapless tale
 and fond believe heart? 
or say, do eloisa line,
 where learning, taste, and love combine,
 a noble flame impart? 

xiii.

the muse in mild melodious lay
 instruction awful voice convey,
 and each wild wish disarm:
 while picture art alone can trace
 each soften line, each secret grace,
 and add to beauty charm. 

xiv.

shall hope her lenient aid refuse,
 though each disastrous day renew
 one sadden scene of woe,
 from please symphony of sound,
 when melt note dissolve around,
 unnumbered rapture flow. 

XV. 

music her sister art may aid,
 and poetry over light and shade
 reflect her mutual fire;
 meek suppliant all at beauty shrine
 in one unite there shall join
 the pencil, Muse, and lyre.
