on a late disturbance in the theatre

when villain be utter by Fennell, around
 the lawyer appear, with their eye on the ground;
 each know his own heart, and in anger do cry,
 i will be revenge, for by god it be i. 
then, to settle the matter, they meet on a call,
 and, convict, agree that it must be they all!
