ON A LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE THEATRE

When Villain was utter'd by Fennell, around
 The lawyers appear, with their eyes on the ground;
 Each knew his own heart, and in anger did cry,
 I will be revenged, for by God it is I. 
Then, to settle the matter, they met on a call,
 And, convicted, agreed that it must be them all!
