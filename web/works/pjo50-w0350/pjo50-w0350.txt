VERSES TO THE Memory of Miss CLAYTON.

If ought can merit thy regard below,
 If when this life, its hopes and fears are o'er,
 The soul retains its passions, or can know
 What storms or tempests reach our distant shore;

View this fond tribute with thy wonted love,
 And whilst the Muse attempts the solemn strain,
 Leave unenjoy'd awhile the realms above,
 And to my Fancy once descend again. 

Fancy, alas! to Memory ally'd,
 Thou cool disturber of our calmest days! 
How dost thou oft our rising transports chide! 
And steal between us and our wish'd-for peace. 

Still, but for Thee, regardless might I stray,
 Where gentle Charwell rolls her silent tide;
 And wear at ease my span of life away,
 As I was wont, when Thou wert by my side. 

But now no more the limpid streams delight,
 No more at ease unheeding do I stray;
 Pleasure and Thou are vanish'd from my sight,
 And life, a span! too slowly hastes away. 

Yet if thy friendship lives beyond the dust,
 Where all things else in peace and silence lie,
 I'll seek Thee there, among the Good and Just,
 'Mong those who living wisely â€” learnt to die. 

And if some friend, when I'm no more, should strive
 To future times my mem'ry to extend,
 Let this inscription on my tomb survive,
 "Here rest the ashes of a faithful friend." 

A little while, and lo! I lay me down,
 To land in silence on that peaceful shore,
 Where never billows beat, or tyrants frown,
 Where we shall meet again, to part no more.
