HOPE.

THE Tree of Knowlege we in Eden prov'd;
 The Tree of Life was thence to Heav'n remov'd:
 Hope is the growth of Earth, the only Plant,
 Which either Heav'n, or Paradice cou'd want. 
Hell knows it not, to Us alone confin'd,
 And Cordial only to the Human Mind. 
Receive it then, t'expel these mortal Cares,
 Nor wave a Med'cine, which thy God prepares.
