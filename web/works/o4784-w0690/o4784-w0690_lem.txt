hope.

the tree of knowledge we in Eden prove;
 the tree of life be thence to heaven remove:
 hope be the growth of earth, the only plant,
 which either heaven, or paradise can want. 
hell know it not, to we alone confine,
 and cordial only to the human mind. 
receive it then, t'expel these mortal care,
 nor wave a medicine, which thy god prepare.
