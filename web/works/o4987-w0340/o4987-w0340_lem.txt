a ballad.

by the same.

hark, hark, it be a voice from the tomb,
 come, Lucy, it cry, come away,
 the grave of thy Colin have room
 to rest thou beside his cold clay. 
i come, my dear shepherd, i come,
 you friend and companion adieu,
 i haste to my colin dark home,
 to die on his bosom so true. 

all mournful the midnight bell ring,
 when Lucy, sad Lucy, arise;
 and forth to the green turf she spring,
 where colin pale ash repose. 
all wet with the night chill dew,
 her bosom embrace the cold ground,
 while stormy wind over she blow,
 and night-raven croak all around. 

how long, my love Colin, she cry,
 how long must thy Lucy complain? 
how long shall the grave my love hide? 
how long ere it join we again? 
for thou thy fond shepherdess live,
 with thou over the world will she fly;
 for thou have she sorrow and grieve;
 for thou will she lie down and die. 

alas! what avail it how dear
 thy Lucy be once to her swain! 
her face like the lily so fair,
 and eye that give light to the plain. 
the shepherd that love her be go;
 that face and those eye charm no more;
 and Lucy forget, and alone,
 to death shall her Colin deplore. 

while thus she lie sink in despair,
 and mourn to the echo around,
 inflame all at once grow the air,
 and thunder shake dreadful the ground. 
i hear the kind call, and obey,
 o! Colin receive i, she cry,
 then breathe a groan over his clay,
 she hang on his tombstone and die.
