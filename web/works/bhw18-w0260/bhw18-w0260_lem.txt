sonnet

to love. 

ah, love! ere yet i know thy fatal power,
 bright glow the colour of my youthful day,
 as on the sultry zone the torrid ray,
 that paint the broad-leaved plantain glossy bower:
 calm be my bosom as this silent hour,
 when over the deep, scarce hear, the zephyr stray,
 amid the cool tamarind indolent play,
 nor from the orange shake its odorous flower: â€”
 but ah! since love have all my heart possess,
 that desolate heart what sorrow tear! 
disturb, and wild as ocean trouble breast,
 when the hoarse tempest of the night be there! 
yet my complain spirit ask no rest,
 this bleed bosom cherish despair.
