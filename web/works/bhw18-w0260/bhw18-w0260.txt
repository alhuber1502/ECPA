SONNET

TO LOVE. 

AH, Love! ere yet I knew thy fatal power,
 Bright glow'd the colour of my youthful days,
 As on the sultry zone the torrid rays,
 That paint the broad-leav'd plantain's glossy bower:
 Calm was my bosom as this silent hour,
 When o'er the deep, scarce heard, the zephyr strays,
 'Midst the cool tamarinds indolently plays,
 Nor from the orange shakes its od'rous flower: â€”
 But ah! since Love has all my heart possest,
 That desolated heart what sorrows tear! 
Disturb'd, and wild as ocean's troubled breast,
 When the hoarse tempest of the night is there! 
Yet my complaining spirit asks no rest,
 This bleeding bosom cherishes despair.
