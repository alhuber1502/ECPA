verse write in sylvia prior.

by the same.

untouched by love, unmoved by wit,
i find no charm in Matthew lyre,
but unconcerned read all he write,
though love and Phoebus do inspire:

till Sylvia take her favourite part,
resolve to prove my judgement wrong;
her proof prevail, they reach my heart,
and soon i feel the poet song.
