VERSES written in SYLVIA'S PRIOR.

By the Same.

UNtouch'd by love, unmov'd by wit,
I found no charms in MATTHEW'S lyre,
But unconcern'd read all he writ,
Tho' love and Phoebus did inspire:

Till SYLVIA took her favourite's part,
Resolv'd to prove my judgment wrong;
Her proofs prevail'd, they reach'd my heart,
And soon I felt the poet's song.
