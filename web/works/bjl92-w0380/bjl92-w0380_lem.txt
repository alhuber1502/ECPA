the captivate soldier. 

you swain unacquainted with love,
 attend to my pitiful lay:
 my pipe shall resound through the grove,
 and my woe in sad accent display. 

long time i with freedom do range;
 with indifference i gaze on the fair:
 now my heart, how affect the change! 
Matilda have catch in the snare. 

ah i! how unlucky the day,
 when thoughtless i hasten to view
 a wedding be come this way,
 nor dream i of what do ensue. 

Matilda appear in her charm;
 her cheek with soft blush do glow:
 my bosom be fill with alarm,
 nor know i who wound i so. 

her shape it be handsome; her air
 excel all the nymph of the town:
 her eye may with diamond compare;
 her lock of the lovely brown. 

she swift from my presence do fly. 
i call, but she answer i not:
 she fear that some danger may be
 sly lurk beneath the red coat. 

if red will affrighten my dear,
 i will dress in the good russet grey,
 abandon my sword and my spear,
 and call my bright armour away. 

no more i will attend to the drum;
 but take up my shuttle and weave:
 from that sure no danger can come,
 such clown have no art to deceive. 

no razor shall come on my face,
 nor powder be see on my hair:
 i will walk at no regular pace;
 in brogue to my love i will repair. 

o then, will she hear my soft tale? 
o then, will Matilda prove kind? 
if rustic with she can prevail,
 the rustic in i she shall find.
