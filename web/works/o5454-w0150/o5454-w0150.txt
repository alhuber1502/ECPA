SONG XV.

Against Lying.

I.

O 'Tis a lovely Thing for Youth
 To walk betimes in Wisdom's Way;
 To fear a Lie, to speak the Truth,
 That we may trust to all they say. 

II.

But Liars we can never trust,
 Tho' they should speak the Thing that's true;
 And he that does one Fault at first,
 And lies to hide it, makes it two. 

III.

Have we not known, nor heard, nor read,
 How GOD abhors Deceit and Wrong? 
How Ananias was struck dead,
 Catch'd with a Lie upon his Tongue? 

IV.

So did his Wife Sapphira die,
 When she came in, and grew so bold
 As to confirm that wicked Lie
 That just before her Husband told. 

V.

The LORD delights in them that speak
 The Words of Truth; but ev'ry Liar
 Must have his Portion in the Lake
 That burns with Brimstone and with Fire. 

VI.

Then let me always watch my Lips,
 Lest I be struck to Death and Hell,
 Since GOD a Book of Reck'ning keeps
 For ev'ry Lie that Children tell.
