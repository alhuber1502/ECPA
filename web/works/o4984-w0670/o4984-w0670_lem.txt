the man of pleasure.

by the same.

yes, to the sage be it tell,
 however great, or wise, or old —
 fair pleasure my pursuit;
 for she i breathe the joyful day,
 for she through nature wild i stray,
 and cull the flower and fruit. 

sweep, sweep the lute enchant string,
 and all thy sweet love luxury bring! 
 "to enjoy be to obey;"
 the heavenly mandate still prevail,
 and let each unwise wretch bewail
 the dire neglect day. 

ah! graceless wretch! to disobey,
 and devious quit the flowery way,
 and slight the god decree! 
still, still, you god, the blessing send! 
if ever my guilty hand offend,
 indeed my heart be free. 

in pleasure ray see nature shine,
 how dull, alas! at wisdom shrine! 
 "it be folly to be wise:"
 collusive term, poor vain pretence,
 enjoyment sure be real sense
 in philosophic eye. 

i love the carol of the hound,
 enrapture on the live ground,
 in dash ecstasy;
 i love the awkward courser stride,
 the courser that have be well try,
 and with he eager fly. 

and yes, i love, you sneer wise! —
 fair honour, spurn still at lie,
 as court liberty;
 still hand in hand great nature go,
 with joy to honour never foe,
 and all those joy be free. 

and welcome thrice to british land,
 from italy voluptuous strand,
 you destine man of art;
 breathe on the thrill meaning sound,
 each grace shall still be faithful find,
 at your admirer heart. 

avert, you god! that curse of fool,
 the pride of theoretic rule;
 that dupery of sense:
 i never refuse the proffer joy,
 with every good — that can annoy —
 most easy dispense. 

i catch each rapture as it fly,
 each happy loss a gain supply,
 and boon still follow boon:
 the smile of beauty gild my day,
 regardless of her frown i stray; —
 thus through my hour i run! 

but let i not for idle rhyme
 neglect, ungrateful, good old time:
 dear watch! thou be obey —
 it be thus the man of pleasure speak,
 his jovial step then careless take
 to Celia — or her maid.
