address to my harp.

oh, my love harp! companion dear! 
sweet sooth of my secret grief,
 no more thy sound my soul must cheer,
 no more afford a soft relief. 

when anxious care my heart oppress,
 when doubt distract tear my soul,
 the pain which heave my swell breast
 thy gentle sway can oft control. 

each well remember, practise strain,
 the cheerful dance, the tender song,
 recall with pensive, please pain
 some image love and cherish long. 

where joy sit smile over my fate,
 and mark each bright and happy day,
 when partial friend around i sit,
 and teach my lip the simple lay;

and when by disappointment grieve
 i see some darling hope overthrow,
 thou have my secret pain relieve;
 over thou i weep, unseen, alone. 

oh! must i leave thou, must we part,
 dear partner of my happy day? 
i may forget thy much-loved art,
 unused thy melody to raise,

but never can memory cease to love
 those scene where i thy charm have feel,
 though i no more thy power may prove,
 which teach my soften heart to melt. 

force to forgo with thou this spot,
 endear by many a tender tie,
 when rosy pleasure bless my lot,
 and sparkle in my cheat eye. 

yet still thy string, in fancy ear,
 with soothe melody shall play;
 thy silver sound i oft shall hear,
 to pensive gloom a silent prey.
