to his grace the duke of chandos.

be prince grace with soul like thy,
 prince have still be deem divine. 
such merit as we find in thou,
 first introduce idolatry;
 when a excel form and mind,
 delight, have mislead mankind;
 inspire with a awful sense
 of infinite beneficence. 

be king elective, realm will sue,
 contend to be sway by you. 
yet, though no regal throne be thy,
 thou have no reason to repine;
 since heaven, that give the monarch heart,
 bestow thou far the noble part.
