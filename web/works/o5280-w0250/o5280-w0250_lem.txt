invocation to Cupid.

to Frederick Reynolds, ESQ.

deck with ray of purple light,
 hither, Cupid, wing thy flight;
 through the pure unclouded sky
 let thy shaft unnumbered fly. 

bid the warbler of the grove
 bow before the shrine of love;
 and with thy resistless dart
 pierce, o pierce each youthful heart. 

hark, how round thy hallow shrine,
 sweet chant the tuneful nine;
 over the green enamel plain
 pour all their magic strain. 

Phoebus now with fervid ray
 light thy altar holy blaze;
 and, touch soft his magic lyre,
 join the sweet aonian choir.
