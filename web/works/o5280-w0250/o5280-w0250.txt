INVOCATION TO CUPID.

TO FREDERICK REYNOLDS, ESQ.

DECK'D with rays of purple light,
 Hither, Cupid, wing thy flight;
 Through the pure unclouded sky
 Let thy shafts unnumber'd fly. 

Bid the warblers of the grove
 Bow before the shrine of Love;
 And with thy resistless dart
 Pierce, O pierce each youthful heart. 

Hark, how round thy hallow'd shrine,
 Sweetly chaunt the tuneful Nine;
 O'er the green enamel'd plains
 Pouring all their magic strains. 

Phoebus now with fervid rays
 Lights thy altar's holy blaze;
 And, touching soft his magic lyre,
 Joins the sweet Aonian choir.
