the wish.

i

all i ask of bounteous heaven,
be to live a peaceful life,
in a cottage, sweet retirement,
far from giddy noise and strife.

ii

far from town, and all its vice,
dissipation, care, and fear,
pass all my day serene,
end life, without a tear.

iii

far from ball, and masquerade,
far from opera, park, or play,
far from courtly pomp, and fashion,
innocent blithe and gay.

iv

distant from the mad crowd,
scene of avarice and gain,
quit smoke for silver fountain,
choose health, and leave pain.

v

ease, and comfort, peace and plenty,
always grace the homely board,
every joy that can be wish for,
do the rustic cot afford.

vi

with the lark each morn arise,
no rude care my peace molest,
but contentment sweet possess,
ever happy, ever bless.

vii

each new day my maker praise,
own his goodness every hour,
thank heaven for every blessing,
and revere his mighty power.

viii

one thing more i ask of heaven,
a sincere and faithful youth,
one who heart be ever constant,
full of honour, love, and truth.

ix

bless with judgement, sound and clear,
both the husband, and the friend,
not the clown, or foolish coxcomb,
such a youth kind heaven send.

x

gentle, as the evening breeze,
fan soft the poplar grove,
fresh than the summer morning,
firm in friendship, fond in love,

xi

smart, and witty, mild in manner,
fair in person as in mind,
free from flattery, pride and folly,
such a youth i wish to find.

xii

i desire not power, or riches,
bane to sweet content and ease,
they be not the joy i wish for,
they, alas! can never please.
