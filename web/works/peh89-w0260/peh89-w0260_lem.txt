write on their majesty come to Kew. 

he come, he come, our sacred king,
 now bid the town adieu;
 and all the bell at Richmond ring,
 to welcome he to Kew. 

the air serene, the evening clear,
 the moon so fair to view;
 sweet emblem of our gracious queen,
 that come to day to Kew. 

now soft blow the western gale,
 to waste the joyful strain,
 along the lowly wind vale,
 and tell the distant plain. 

in spring fresh robe the tree be clad,
 the field be fair to view;
 and every loyal heart be glad
 the king be come to Kew. 

you lover of inconstancy,
 now blush and take a view;
 a bright example you may see,
 the royal pair at Kew. 

may god continue still to give
 they pleasure ever new;
 and many summer may they live
 to reign and visit Kew.
