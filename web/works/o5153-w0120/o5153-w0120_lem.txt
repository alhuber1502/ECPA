Damon and Delia. 

in imitation of Horace and Lydia. write in the year 1732. 

by the same.

Damon.

tell i, my Delia, tell i why
my kind, fond look you fly:
what mean this cloud upon your brow?
have i offend? tell i how?
some change have happen in your heart,
some rival there have steal a part;
reason these fear may disapprove:
but yet i fear, because i love.

Delia.

first, tell i, Damon, why today
at belvidera foot you lie?
why with such warmth her charm you praise,
and every trifle beauty raise,
as if you mean to let i see
your flattery be not all for i?
alas! too well your sex i know,
nor be so weak to think you true.

Damon.

unkind! my falsehood to upbraid,
when your own order i obey;
you bid i try by this deceit
the notice of the world to cheat,
and hide beneath another name
the secret of our mutual flame.

Delia.

Damon, your prudence i confess,
but let i wish it have be less;
too well the lover part you play,
with too much art your court you make;
have it be only art, your eye
will not have join in the disguise.

Damon.

ah, cease thus idle to molest
with groundless fear thy virgin breast.
while thus at fancy wrong you grieve,
to i a real pain you give.

Delia.

though well i may your truth distrust,
my foolish heart believe you just;
reason this faith may disapprove,
but i believe, because i love.
