To the Rt. Hon. Charlotte Lady Conway, on her resolving to leave Bath.

O Charlotte, truly pious, early wise! 
The Pleasures sought by others, you despise:
 Nor Bath, nor Bath's Allurements thee detain;
 Unmov'd, you quit them to the Gay and Vain. 
But tho' nor Health, nor Pleasure will prevail;
 The Happiness you give, should turn the Scale. 
O stay, and teach the Virtues of thy Breast:
 Thousands by thy Example may be blest:
 A Mind so humble, and so truly great,
 So fitted to oblige in ev'ry State;
 A Manner, so engaging and discrete,
 A Manner, so inimitably sweet! 
These, and thy thousand Charms, who can express? 
Seymour, how vast a Treasure you possess!
