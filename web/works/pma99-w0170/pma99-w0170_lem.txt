a aunt lamentation for the absence of her niece.

write from Hastings.

like as the dove i sit alone,
 deject, pale, and wan,
 without a friend to hear i moan
 the loss of Marianne. 

now on the rage deep i gaze,
 and all it be wonder scan,
 yet still my thought revert always
 to thou, my Marianne. 

now over my book, my work i pore,
 but do whatever i can,
 my book, my work will charm no more,
 i have lose my Marianne. 

the other morn the fifer play,
 i to the window run,
 and as the music pass, i say,
 where, where be Marianne? 

oft as i hear the sailor bawl
 for Susan or for nan,
 alas, i cry, oh that a call
 will bring i Marianne! 

now on the beach forlorn i stray,
 nor know the face of man,
 yet all will please, each scene be gay,
 have i my Marianne. 

with her each hour i can employ,
 and still new pleasure plan,
 for every hour it will be my joy
 to please my Marianne. 

ah can i view her face i will fly
 from Beersheba to dan,
 no land, no sea beneath the sky
 shall part my Marianne.
