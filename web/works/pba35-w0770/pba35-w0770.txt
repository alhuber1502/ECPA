Reply to the foregoing Verses.

Why did I hope to make your Anguish less? 
I try'd to cure, and I have caught, Distress. 
Suppress your Sighs, dry up your Tears; 'tis Time:
 Excess of Virtue may become a Crime. 
You lost, you say, a Friend, and Father too;
 But know, Mankind would lose a Friend in you.
