the hall of justice.

in two part.

part i 

vagrant.

take, take away thy barbarous hand,
 and let i to thy master speak;
 remit awhile the harsh command,
 and hear i, or my heart will break. 

magistrate.

fond wretch! and what can thou relate,
 but deed of sorrow, shame, and sin? 
thy crime be prove, thou know thy fate;
 but come, thy tale! — begin, begin! —

vagrant.

my crime! — this sicken child to feed,
 i seize the food, your witness see;
 i know your law forbid the deed,
 but yield to a strong law. 

know thou, to nature great command
 all human law be frail and weak? 
nay! frown not — stay his eager hand,
 and hear i, or my heart will break. 

in this, the adopt babe i hold
 with anxious fondness to my breast,
 my heart be sole comfort i behold,
 more dear than life, when life be bless;
 i see she pine, faint, cold,
 i beg — but vain be my request. 

i see the tempt food, and seize —
 my infant-sufferer find relief;
 and, in the pilfer treasure please,
 smile on my guilt, and hush my grief. 

but i have grief of other kind,
 trouble and sorrow more severe;
 give i to ease my torture mind,
 lend to my woe a patient ear;
 and let i — if i may not find
 a friend to help — find one to hear. 

yet nameless let i plead — my name
 will only wake the cry of scorn;
 a child of sin, conceive in shame,
 bring forth in woe, to misery bear. 

my mother dead, my father lose,
 i wander with a vagrant crew;
 a common care, a common cost,
 their sorrow and their sin i know;
 with they, by want on error force,
 like they, i base and guilty grow. 

few be my year, not so my crime;
 the age, which these sad look declare,
 be sorrow work, it be not time be,
 and i be old in shame and care. 

teach to believe the world a place
 where every stranger be a foe,
 train in the art that mark our race,
 to what new people can i go? 
can i a better life embrace,
 or live as virtue dictate? No! —

so through the land i wander go,
 and little find of grief or joy;
 but lose my bosom sweet content
 when first i love — the gipsy-boy. 

a sturdy youth he be and tall,
 his look will all his soul declare;
 his pierce eye be deep and small,
 and strong curl his raven-hair. 

yes, Aaron have each manly charm,
 all in the may of youthful pride,
 he scarce fear his father arm,
 and every other arm defy. —

oft, when they grow in anger warm,
 (who will not love and power divide?) 
i rise, their wrathful soul to calm,
 not yet in sinful combat try. 

his father be our party chief,
 and dark and dreadful be his look;
 his presence fill my heart with grief,
 although to i he kind speak. 

with Aaron i delight go,
 his favour be my bliss and pride;
 in grow hope our day we spend,
 love grow charm in either spy,
 it see they, all which nature lend,
 it lend they, all which she deny. 

can i the father kindness prize,
 or grateful look on he bestow,
 who i behold in wrath arise,
 when Aaron sink beneath his blow? 

he drive he down with wicked hand,
 it be a dreadful sight to see;
 then vex he, till he leave the land,
 and tell his cruel love to i; —
 the clan be all at his command,
 whatever his command may be. 

the night be dark, the lane be deep,
 and one by one they take their way;
 he bid i lay i down and sleep,
 i only weep and wish for day. 

accurse be the love he bear,
 accurse be the force he use,
 so let he of his god implore
 for mercy, and be so refuse! 

you frown again, — to show my wrong
 can i in gentle language speak? 
my woe be deep, my word be strong, —
 and hear i, or my heart will break. 

magistrate.

i hear thy word, i feel thy pain;
 forbear awhile to speak thy woe;
 receive our aid, and then again
 the story of thy life disclose. 

for, though seduce and lead astray,
 thou have travel far and wander long;
 thy god have see thou all the way,
 and all the turn that lead thou wrong. 

part ii.

magistrate.

come, now again thy woe impart,
 tell all thy sorrow, all thy sin;
 we can heal the throb heart
 till we discern the wound within. 

compunction weep our guilt away,
 the sinner safety be his pain;
 such pang for our offence pay,
 and these severe grief be gain. 

vagrant.

the son come back — he find we wed,
 then dreadful be the oath he swear; —
 his way through Blackburn forest lead, —
 his father we behold no more. 

of all our dare clan not one
 will on the doubtful subject dwell;
 for all esteem the injure son,
 and fear the tale which he can tell. 

but i have mighty cause for fear,
 for slow and mournful round my bed
 i see a dreadful form appear, —
 it come when i and Aaron wed. 

yes! we be wed, i know my crime, —
 we sleep beneath the elmin tree;
 but i be grieve all the time,
 and Aaron frown my tear to see. 

for he not yet have feel the pain
 that rankle in a wound breast;
 he wake to sin, then sleep again,
 forsake his god, yet take his rest. —

but i be force to feign delight,
 and joy in mirth and music seek, —
 and memory now recall the night,
 with such surprise and horror fraught,
 that reason feel a moment flight,
 and leave a mind to madness wrought. 

when wake, on my heave breast
 i feel a hand as cold as death:
 a sudden fear my voice suppress,
 a chill terror stop my breath. —

i seem — no word can utter how! 
for there my father-husband stand, —
 and thus he say: — "will god allow,
" the great avenger just and good,
 "a wife to break her marriage vow? 
" a son to shed his father blood? " 

i tremble at the dismal sound,
 but vain strive a word to say;
 so, point to his bleed wound,
 the threaten spectre stalk away. 

i bring a lovely daughter forth,
 his father child, in aaron bed;
 he take she from i in his wrath,
 "where be my child?" — "thy child be dead." 

it be false — we wander far and wide,
 through town and country, field and fen,
 till Aaron, fight, fall and die,
 and i become a wife again. 

i then be young: — my husband sell
 my fancy charm for wicked price,
 he give i oft for sinful gold,
 the slave, but not the friend of vice: —
 behold i, heaven! my pain behold,
 and let they for my sin suffice! 

the wretch who lend i thus for gain,
 despise i when my youth be flee;
 then come disease; and bring i pain: —
 come, death, and bear i to the dead! 
for though i grieve, my grief be vain,
 and fruitless all the tear i shed. 

true, i be not to virtue train,
 yet well i know my deed be ill;
 by each offence my heart be pain,
 i weep, but i offend still;
 my better thought my life disdain,
 but yet the vile lead my will. 

my husband die, and now no more
 my smile be seek, or ask my hand,
 a widow vagrant, vile and poor,
 beneath a vagrant vile command. 

ceaseless i rove the country round,
 to win my bread by fraudful art,
 and long a poor subsistence find,
 by spread net for simple heart. 

though poor, and abject, and despise,
 their fortune to the crowd i tell;
 i give the young the love they prize,
 and promise wealth to bless the old;
 scheme for the doubtful i devise,
 and charm for the forsake sell. 

at length for art like these confine
 in prison with a lawless crew,
 i soon perceive a kindred mind,
 and there my long-lost daughter know;

his father child, who Aaron give
 to wander with a distant clan,
 the misery of the world to brave,
 and be the slave of vice and man. 

she know my name — we meet in pain,
 our part pang can i express? 
she sail a convict over the main,
 and leave a heir to her distress. 

this be that heir to shame and pain,
 for who i only can descry
 a world of trouble and disdain:
 yet, can i bear to see she die,
 or stretch her feeble hand in vain,
 and, weep, beg of i supply? 

No! though the fate thy mother know
 be shameful! shameful though thy race
 have wander all a lawless crew,
 outcast despise in every place;

yet as the dark and muddy tide,
 when far from its pollute source,
 become more pure and purify,
 flow in a clear and happy course;

in thou, dear infant! so may end
 our shame, in thou our sorrow cease! 
and thy pure course will then extend,
 in flood of joy, over vale of peace. 

Oh! by the god who love to spare,
 deny i not the boon i crave;
 let this love child your mercy share,
 and let i find a peaceful grave;

make she yet spotless soul your care,
 and let my sin their portion have;
 she for a better fate prepare,
 and punish who it be sin to save! 

magistrate.

recall the word, renounce the thought,
 command thy heart and bend thy knee. 
there be to all a pardon bring,
 a ransom rich, assure and free;
 it be full when find, it be find if seek,
 Oh! seek it, till it be seal to thou. 

vagrant.

but how my pardon shall i know? 

magistrate.

by feel dread that it be not send,
 by tear for sin that free flow,
 by grief, that all thy tear be spend,

by thought on that great debt we owe,
 with all the mercy god have lend,
 by suffer what thou can not show,
 yet show how thy heart be rend,
 till thou can feel thy bosom glow,
 and say, "my Saviour, i repent!"
