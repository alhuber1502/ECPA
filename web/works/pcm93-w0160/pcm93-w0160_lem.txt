on return to lehena,

in may, m Dcc lxxxviii.

welcome once more, my native land! 
what joy to breathe the perfume gale,
 which, as immerse in thought i stand,
 salute i from the hawthorn vale! 

o solitude! of mind serene,
 parent of innocence and peace,
 preside for ever over this scene,
 nor let this grateful silence cease! 

i have leave the gay path of life,
 where reason never can pleasure find,
 where ever restless, busy strife
 leave looked-for happiness behind. 

there flattery over my youthful cheek
 have spread a momentary glow;
 there vanity have make i seek
 the gild roof of hide woe. 

there have i see neglect worth,
 abash, decline she honest head,
 while vice in gaudy robe come forth,
 by pride and adulation lead. 

there envy steep the poison dart,
 to strike at merit open breast;
 there smooth, insinuate art
 deceive the wise and the best. 

the noble, who be wont to raise
 to liberty a spotless shrine,
 to avarice now devote their day,
 for her unhallowed garland twine. 

the gentle virgin, who of yore
 think worth and happiness the same,
 contemn what she revere before,
 and truth she call a empty name. 

the beauty, who relentless time
 have rob of every boast grace,
 retain the folly of her prime,
 and deck with borrow bloom her face. 

but say, amid such scene as these,
 can i still hope my mind be free? 
say, in this more than cretan maze,
 be i devote still to thou? 

do never ambition swell my breast,
 or sparkle in my dazzle eye? 
do never offend pride molest
 my hour, or prompt the heave sigh? 

yes: i have feel their baneful power,
 have own their universal sway,
 be tempt in one thoughtless hour
 their shameful dictate to obey. 

but reason raise my faint soul,
 ere i the magic draught can sip;
 ere i have touch the syren bowl,
 she turn it from my eager lip. 

 "Amoret," she cry, "for ever leave
" this scene where vice and folly reign;
 "the time you have lose in crowd retrieve,
" nor hope for bliss but on the plain. " 

with this kind counsel i comply,
 no long worldly splendour prize;
 nor shall i build my noble pride
 but on become good and wise. 

accept then, solitude, my prayer,
 a weary wanderer receive;
 strengthen by thou, i will prepare
 by spotless virtue for the grave.
