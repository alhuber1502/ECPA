GOD our Portion.

From the Spanish. 

I.

O GOD, my GOD, my All Thou art;
 Ere shines the Dawn of rising Day
 Thy sov'reign Light within my Heart,
 Thy all-enliv'ning Pow'r display. 

II.

For Thee my thirsty Soul does pant,
 While in this desert Land I live:
 And hungry as I am and faint
 Thy Love alone can Comfort give. 

III.

In a dry Land behold I place
 My whole Desire on Thee, O LORD:
 And more I joy to gain thy Grace
 Than all Earth's Treasures can afford. 

IV.

In Holiness within thy Gates
 Of old oft have I sought for Thee! 
Again my longing Spirit waits
 That Fulness of Delight to see. 

V.

More dear than Life itself thy Love
 My Heart and Tongue shall still employ,
 And to declare thy Praise will prove
 My Peace, my Glory, and my Joy. 

VI.

In blessing Thee with grateful Songs
 My happy Life shall glide away;
 The Praise that to thy Name belongs
 Hourly with lifted Hands I'll pay. 

VII.

Abundant Sweetness, while I sing
 Thy Love, my ravish'd Soul o'erflows,
 Secure in Thee, my GOD and King,
 Of Glory that no Period knows. 

VIII.

Thy Name, O LORD, upon my Bed
 Dwells on my Lips, and fires my Thought,
 With trembling Awe in midnight Shade,
 I muse on all thy Hands have wrought. 

IX.

In all I do I feel thy Aid;
 Therefore thy Greatness will I sing,
 O GOD, who bid'st my Heart be glad
 Beneath the Shadow of thy Wing. 

X.

My Soul draws nigh, and cleaves to Thee;
 Then let or Earth or Hell assail,
 Thy mighty Hand shall set me free,
 For whom Thou sav'st, He ne'er shall fail.
