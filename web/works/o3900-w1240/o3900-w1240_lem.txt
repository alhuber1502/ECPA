o god, my god, my all thou be;
 ere shine the dawn of rise day
 thy sovereign light within my heart,
 thy all-enliv'ning power display.

for thou my thirsty soul do pant,
 while in this desert land i live:
 and hungry as i be and faint

 my whole desire on thou, o lord:
 and more i joy to gain thy grace
 than all earth treasure can afford.

 of old oft have i seek for thou!

 my heart and tongue shall still employ,
 and to declare thy praise will prove

in blessing thou with grateful song
 my happy life shall glide away;
 the praise that to thy name belong
 hourly with lift hand i will pay.

 thy love, my ravish soul overflow,
 secure in thou, my god and king,
 of glory that no period know. 

viii.

 dwell on my lip, and fire my thought,
 with tremble awe in midnight shade,
 i muse on all thy hand have wrought.

in all i do i feel thy aid;
 therefore thy greatness will i sing,
 o god, who bid my heart be glad
 beneath the shadow of thy wing.

my soul draw nigh, and cleave to thou;
 then let or earth or hell assail,
 thy mighty hand shall set i free,
 for who thou save, he never shall fail.
