write at Camberwell, near London, in the study of mr. Wainwright, now baron of the exchequer in Ireland, where the author accidental dine alone.

while happy i pass my hour
 in camberwell delightful bower;
 from thence the beauteous walk survey;
 or through the fragrant maze stray;
 or over the study cast my eye,
 where Virgil, coke, and Horace lie,
 just emblem of a bosom grace
 with law, and elegance of taste;
 Apollo i invoke in vain,
 Apollo answer with disdain:

 "mortal, you be here allow to roam. 
"and bid to think yourself at home:
 "over the domestic then preside;
"let that content your female pride;
 "in vain you call on i today;
"here Wainwright only i obey.
