Glory be to GOD on high, &c.

I.

GLORY be to GOD on high,
 GOD whose Glory fills the Sky:
 Peace on Earth to Man forgiv'n,
 Man the Well-belov'd of Heav'n! 

II.

Sov'reign Father, Heav'nly King! 
Thee we now presume to sing;
 Glad Thine Attributes confess,
 Glorious all and numberless. 

III.

Hail! by all thy Works ador'd,
 Hail! the everlasting Lord! 
Thee with thankful Hearts we prove
 Lord of Pow'r, and GOD of Love. 

IV.

CHRIST our LORD and GOD we own,
 CHRIST the Father's only Son! 
Lamb of GOD for Sinners slain,
 Saviour of offending Man! 

V.

Bow thine Ear, in Mercy bow,
 Hear, the World's Attonement Thou! 
JESU, in thy Name we pray,
 Take, O take our Sins away. 

VI.

Pow'rful Advocate with GOD,
 Justify us by thy Blood! 
Bow thine Ear, in Mercy bow,
 Hear, the World's Attonement Thou! 

VII.

Hear; for Thou, O CHRIST alone
 With thy Glorious Sire art One! 
One the Holy Ghost with Thee,
 One supreme Eternal Three.
