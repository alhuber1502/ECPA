when the soft tear steal silent.

when the soft tear steal silent down from the eye,
 take no note of its course, nor detect the slow sigh;
 from some spring of shy sorrow its origin flow,
 some tender remembrance that weep as it go. 

ah! it be not to say what will bring to the mind
 the sweet joy depart, the friend leave behind;
 a tune, or a song, or the time of the year,
 strike the key of reflection, and moan in the ear. 

through the gay scene of youth the remembrancer stray,
 till memory step back on old pleasure to gaze;
 fleet shadow they seem that glide calm away,
 the remains of past hour, and the ghost of a day. 

when we set out in life every thing have its charm,
 enkindle the fancy, and all the heart warm;
 it be this make we look on the joy that be past
 with a eye that turn cool to glance on the last. 

let the tear then flow on, nor mark the full eye,
 it be the soul secret offer no mortal shall spy;
 few heart be prepare for a rite so divine,
 when the feeling alone sacrifice at the shrine.
