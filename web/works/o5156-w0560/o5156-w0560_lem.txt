to mr. garnier and mr. Pearce of bath.

a grateful ode, in return for the extraordinary kindness and humanity they show to i and my old daughter, now lady Essex, 1753. 

by the same.

i 

what glorious verse from love have spring?
how well have indignation sing?
and can the gentle muse,
while in she once belove abode
i stray, and suppliant kneel, a ode
to gratitude refuse?

ii.

garnier, my friend, accept this verse,
and thou receive, well-natured Pearce,
all i can give of fame.
let other, other subject sing,
some murderous chief, some tyrant king,
humanity my theme.

iii.

for art like you, employ by you,
make verse on such a theme your due,
to who indulgent heaven
its favourite power of do good,
by you so right understand,
judicious have give.

iv.

behold, obedient to your power,
consume fever rage no more,
nor chill ague freeze;
the cripple dance void of pain,
the deaf in rapture hear again,
the blind transport see.

v. 

health at your call extend her wing,
each heal plant, each friendly spring,
its various power disclose;
over death approach you prevail,
see Chloe cheek, of late so pale,
bloom with return rose.

vi.

these gift, my friend, which shine in you,
be rare, yet to some choose few
heaven have the same assign;
health wait on mead prescription still,
and hawkins hand, and ranby skill,
be blessing to mankind.

vii.

but heart like you be rare indeed,
which for another wound can bleed,
another grief can feel;
the lover fear, the parent groan,
your nature catch, and make your own,
and share the pain you heal.

viii.

but why to they, hygeia, why
do thou thy cordial drop deny
who but for other live?
oh, goddess, hear my prayer, and grant
that these that health may never want,
which they to other give.
