speak extempore, to the right honourable the lady Barbara north, on her present the author with a white ribbon at tunbridge-well.

this present from a lovely dame,
 fair and unsullied, as her fame,
 shall to Hibernia be convey,
 where once, revere, her father sway;
 and teach the droop art to smile,
 and with his virtue bless our isle.
