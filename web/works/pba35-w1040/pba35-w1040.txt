Spoken extempore, to the Right Honourable the Lady Barbara North, on her presenting the Author with a white Ribband at Tunbridge-Wells.

This Present from a lovely Dame,
 Fair and unsully'd, as her Fame,
 Shall to Hibernia be convey'd,
 Where once, rever'd, her Father sway'd;
 And taught the drooping Arts to smile,
 And with his Virtues bless'd our Isle.
