Written for my Son, and spoken by him at School to some of the Fellows of the College of Dublin, at a public Examination for Victors.

When Athens was for Arts and Arms renown'd,
 Olympic Wreaths uncommon Merit crown'd. 
These slight Distinctions from the Learn'd and Wise,
 Convey'd eternal Honour with the Prize:
 'Twas this, the gen'rous Love of Fame inspir'd,
 And Grecian Breasts with noblest Ardor fir'd. 

For like Rewards like Judges we implore:
 Immortal Fame, with Grecian Arts, restore:
 Our growing Merit with Indulgence view;
 And sure you'll favour what distinguish'd you. 

Leave Ignorance and Sloth to Scorn and Shame;
 But crown the Worthy with immortal Fame;
 And Fame, conferr'd by you, can never fail:
 What Men have purchas'd, they of Right entail.
