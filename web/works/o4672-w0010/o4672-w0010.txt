THE Divine Sovereignty.

I.

GReat God, indulge a Mortal Tongue,
 Nor let thy Thunders roar
 Whilst little Notes and feeble Song
 Attempt th' Eternal Pow'r. 

II.

Life, Death, and Hell, and Worlds unknown
 Hang on thy firm Decree;
 Thou sit'st on no precarious Throne,
 Nor Borrowest leave to Be. 

III.

Thy Sovereign Voice bids ancient Night
 Her Spacious Realms resign,
 And Lo! ten Thousand Globes of Light
 In Fields of Azure shine. 

IV.

Thy Wisdom with Superiour Sway
 Guides this vast moving Frame;
 Whilst all the Ranks of Being pay
 Deep Reverence to thy Name. 

V.

Vengeance attends t' obey thy Frown,
 And Blessings wait thy Smile;
 A Wreath of Lightning arms thy Crown,
 But Love adorns it still. 

VI.

Unnumber'd Wonders in thee meet,
 And various Glory shines;
 The Crossing Rays too fiercely beat
 Upon our fainting Minds. 

VII.

Angels are lost in sweet Surprize
 If thou unvail thy Grace;
 And humble Awe runs thro' the Skies
 When Wrath arrays thy Face. 

VIII.

When Mercy joyns with Majesty
 To spread their Beams abroad,
 Not all the fairest Minds on high
 Are Shadows of a God. 

IX.

Thy Mighty Works Great Gabriel Sings
 In a too feeble Strain;
 And labours upon all his Strings
 To reach thy Thoughts in vain. 

X.

Created Powers how weak they be! 
How short our Praises fall! 
So much akin to Nothing We,
 And Thou th' Eternal All.
