a epistle

to miss ISABELLA Graham of Gartmore.

at early dawn brisk Archy rise,
 and tight garter on his hose;
 he in his bosom place a sprig,
 and put on his best philibeg,
 mount his sheltie — then demand,
 "give lady Susan have command,
 to Gartmore, madam, i be go" —
 respectful the while keep bow; —
 "a letter, if you will please to give it,
 the morn miss tibby shall receive it;"
 i thank you, Archy; — yes, i will send
 a letter to my dear friend. 

just then remembrance seem to say,
 "why, sure, you write but yesterday! 
and, scribble every day such nonsense,
 in truth you have but little conscience;
 your scroll be all so hard to read,
 they be each a Athanasian creed,
 which not a mortal understand,
 so quick the line form in your hand;
 and every thought, as you conceive it,
 though immature, you being give it;
 still, still to wisdom fullgrown thought
 your small idea seem a mote,
 therefore on paper no more note they." 
but may and tibby will out blot they! 
exclaim my heart in great emotion,
 sting to the quick at wisdom caution;
 it be true my heart know no restraint,
 i laugh, or sing, or make complaint;
 just as the heart compound the dye
 the colour flush to the eye,
 and while to friendship ken display,
 be ever see its light and shade. 

it be friendship hold the faithful glass
 which let no fault unnoticed pass,
 but place they in such a light
 as soften meet the conscious sight;
 amendment soon smooth every feature,
 and show a less imperfect creature;
 and friendship kind observance show
 dark error tint or virtue glow. 
happy the few who find the friend
 who candour strive each fault to mend;
 who deal reproof with lenient care,
 touch each fault, yet strive to spare;
 for even the honest feeling heart
 with soft chastisement will smart, —
 by conscious defalcation sting,
 and pain the most to have act wrong;
 then be it friendship constant part
 to mend but not afflict the heart. 

thus, with myself in mental confab,
 and have own my pen a sad blab, —
 vex even that caution shall distrust
 those friend i love, those friend so just,
 those steadfast heart i dare confide in,
 and hope for ever to reside in,
 i drive cold prudence from my ear,
 her whisper doubt refuse to hear,
 promise to list some other day,
 my letter seal, and send away.
