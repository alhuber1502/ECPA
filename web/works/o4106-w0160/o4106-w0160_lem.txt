a imitation of some french verse.

relentless time! destroy power
 who stone and brass obey,
 who give to every fly hour
 to work some new decay;
 unheard, unheeded, and unseen,
 thy secret Saps prevail,
 and ruin man, a nice machine
 by nature form to fail. 
my change arrive; the change i meet,
 before i think it nigh. 
my spring, my year of pleasure fleet,
 and all their beauty die. 
in age i search, and only find
 a poor unfruitful gain,
 grave wisdom stalk slow behind,
 oppress with load of pain. 
my ignorance can once beguile,
 and fancy joy inspire;
 my error cherish hope to smile
 on newly-born desire. 
but now experience show, the bliss
 for which i fond seek,
 not worth the long impatient wish,
 and ardour of the thought. 
my youth meet fortune fair array,
 (in all her pomp she shine)
 and may, perhaps, have well essay
 to make her gift my own:
 but when i see the blessing shower
 on some unworthy mind,
 i leave the chace, and own he power
 be just paint blind. 
i pass the glory which adorn
 the splendid court of king,
 and while the person move my scorn,
 i rise to scorn the thing. 
my manhood feel a vigorous fire
 by love increase the more;
 but year with come year conspire
 to break the chain i wear. 
in weakness safe, the sex i see
 with idle lustre shine;
 for what be all their joy to i,
 which can now be i? 
but hold â€” i feel my gout decrease,
 my trouble lay to rest,
 and truth which will disturb my peace
 be painful truth at best. 
vain the time i have to roll
 in sad reflection fly;
 you fondle passion of my soul! 
you sweet deceit! arise. 
i wise change the scene within;
 to thing that use to please;
 in pain, philosophy be spleen,
 in health, it be only ease.
