A SONG.

A thousand Gay obliging Youths,
 I unconcern'd can see,
 But when Exalis doth appear;
 He shakes my Constancy. 

In spite of all my Proud Resolves,
 I soften at his Charms,
 And almost wish my self to be;
 In his regardless Arms. 

Some milder Power, reverse my Fate,
 He's doom'd to Love elsewhere,
 I beg my Passion you'd Translate;
 I would not rob his Fair. 

Let him persue his fond Amour,
 Grant I may pity those,
 Who sigh for me and make him kind;
 Unto the Nymph he's chose.
