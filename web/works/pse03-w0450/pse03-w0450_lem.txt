a song.

a thousand gay oblige youth,
 i unconcerned can see,
 but when Exalis do appear;
 he shake my constancy. 

in spite of all my proud resolve,
 i soften at his charm,
 and almost wish my self to be;
 in his regardless arm. 

some mild power, reverse my fate,
 he be doom to love elsewhere,
 i beg my passion you will translate;
 i will not rob his fair. 

let he pursue his fond amour,
 grant i may pity those,
 who sigh for i and make he kind;
 unto the nymph he be choose.
