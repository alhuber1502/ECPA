[sonetto. di Giovanni Della Casa.]

sonnet, to sleep. translation

son of the silent, dark, and humid night,
 consoler of the wretched, by who sway
 the gloomy train of ill be put to flight,
 that blacken life uncertain, tedious day,

o! succour now this restless, pine heart! 
give to these feeble, weary limb repose! 
fly to i sleep! and let thy somber wing
 over my couch their dusky plume disclose! 

o! where be silence, who avoid the light? 
where the wild dream that flutter in thy train? 
alas! in vain i call thou, cruel night! 
and flatter these insensate shade in vain. 

and oh! without thy cheer dew be shed,
 how full of hardship be the downy bed!
