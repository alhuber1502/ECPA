ode to love.

to the right honourable lady Dudley and ward.

all hail to thou, resistless power! 
before who shrine all nature bow,
 and fond breathe her ardent vow! 
hail, parent of the blissful hour! 
hail, theme of sappho tremble lyre! 
hail, theme of petrarch plaintive strain! 
hail, mystic source of joy and pain! 
hail, theme of nature woodland choir! 

with mazy dance, and breathe song,
 the joy around thy altar throng. 
though, amid thy smile train,
 jocund pleasure tread the plain;
 yet mark yond spectre gloomy air,
 who, while the grace fond twine
 their roseate wreath around thy shrine,
 insidious plant the cypress there. 

say, Cupid, now what phantom drear
 approach near,
 on who tear breast
 the serpent rear his scaly crest,
 tear, with venom tooth,
 the seat of life and truth;
 while through the gape wound black gore,
 in sullen tide, be see to pour. 
thy mat hair,
 thy frantic stare,
 thy green eye fall;
 these, jealous fiend, thy name will tell. 
see, as the love disport round,
 dance to the rebeck jocund sound,
 with rage inspire,
 by vengeance fire,
 while, horror-struck, the grace gaze;
 see mad through the daedal maze,
 as couple now with writhe pain,
 in hurry step he tread the plain;
 and, spurn, love, thy wily song,
 disperse thus thy fright throng. 

O! thou who, amid the roar wave,
 a early fate to Sappho give;
 who lure with siren strain,
 and promise joy,
 the grecian boy,
 to blow the wintery main,
 though quench in night
 thy faithless light,
 that beam on high,
 and let a lover die. 
amid the elemental war
 he ask in vain the dove-drawn car,
 that erst thy goddess-mother bear
 from neptune realm to paphos shore:
 but deaf to hero ardent prayer,
 but heedless of a lover care,
 and deaf to sad leander cry,
 you seek, false power, serener sky. 

then, Heloise, thy victim fall. 
Ah! see she stretch in yonder cell. 
by all thy fierce passion bear,
 bereave of hope, through thou forlorn. 
attentive hear each groan, each sigh,
 and mark the lamp that dim burn
 around her lover holy urn. 
now pour slow
 sad note of woe,
 see Petrarch seek his laura grave. 
Hark! how the sadden strain
 wander over vauclusa plain. 
thy be his lay,
 and thy the praise
 thou kindledst first the fatal fire,
 then tune to grief his plaintive lyre. 
round laura tomb,
 with cheerless gloom,
 thy cypress sad be see to wave,
 while pity self slow pause there,
 with lethe blissful balm,
 the mourner pang can calm;
 but yonder groan, that pierce the air,
 proclaim all thy reign despair. 
since such thy power, since such thy deed,
 since gore by thou each bosom bleed,
 from i thy shaft, dread godhead, turn;
 never shall my breast devote burn. 
thy cup circean free give
 to those who wish with thou to live. 
thy art i spurn, thy joy despise;
 minerva smile alone i prize.
