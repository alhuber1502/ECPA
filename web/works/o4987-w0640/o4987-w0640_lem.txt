write on another open temple under the word “mihi et amicis.”

by the same.

thy friend have access to a noble part,
 they claim the open temple of thy heart,
 o may no sigh from that calm region bear,
 thy shade soft whisper turn to sound forlorn,

far, far be thence each monument of pain,
 no painting there of sorrow past remain! 
to please by art, by nature charm to please,
 the first great object be a mind at ease.
