WRITTEN ON ANOTHER OPEN TEMPLE UNDER THE WORDS “MIHI ET AMICIS.”

BY THE SAME.

THY friends have access to a nobler part,
 They claim the open Temple of thy heart,
 O may no sighs from that calm region borne,
 Thy shade's soft whispers turn to sounds forlorn,

Far, far be thence each monument of pain,
 No paintings there of sorrows past remain! 
To please by Art, by Nature's charms to please,
 The first great object is a mind at ease.
