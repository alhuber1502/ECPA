the battle between the rat and the weazle. 

in dire contest the rat and weazle meet,
 and foot to foot, and point to point be set:
 a ancient quarrel have such hatred wrought,
 that for revenge, as for renown, they fight. 
now bloody be the day, and hard the strife,
 wherein bold warrior lose neglect life:
 but as, some error still we must commit,
 nor valour always balance be by wit;
 among the rat some officer appear,
 with lofty plumage on their forehead rear,
 unthinking they, and ruin by their pride:
 for when the weazel prove the strong side,
 a general rout befall, and a retreat,
 be by the vanquish now implore of fate;
 to slender cranny all repair in haste,
 where easy the undress vulgar past:
 but when the rat of figure will have flee,
 so wide those branch mark of honour spread,
 the feather in the cap be fatal to the head.
