The following Lines occasion'd by the Marriage of Edward Herbert Esquire, and Mrs. Elizabeth Herbert. 

CUPID one day ask'd his Mother,
 When she meant that he shou'd Wed? 
You're too Young, my Boy, she said:
 Nor has Nature made another
 Fit to match with Cupid's Bed. 

Cupid then her Sight directed
 To a lately Wedded Pair;
 Where Himself the Match effected;
 They as Youthful, they as Fair. 

Having by Example carry'd
 This first Point in the Dispute;
 WORSELEY next he said's not Marry'd:
 Her's with Cupid's Charms may suit.
