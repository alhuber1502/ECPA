RHYMES.

BUSY work brings after ease;
 Ease brings sport and sport brings rest;
 For young and old of all degrees,
 The mingled lot is best. 

And pain brings pity; then I hear
 My mother's sweet and gentle voice,
 She strokes my cheek, the touch is dear,
 And makes my heart rejoice. 

Then welcome work and pain and play
 When all is o'er, like bird in nest
 We soundly sleep; â€” well says our lay,
 The mingled lot is best.
