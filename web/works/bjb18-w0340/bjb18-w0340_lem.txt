rhyme.

busy work bring after ease;
 ease bring sport and sport bring rest;
 for young and old of all degree,
 the mingle lot be best. 

and pain bring pity; then i hear
 my mother sweet and gentle voice,
 she stroke my cheek, the touch be dear,
 and make my heart rejoice. 

then welcome work and pain and play
 when all be over, like bird in nest
 we sound sleep; â€” well say our lay,
 the mingle lot be best.
