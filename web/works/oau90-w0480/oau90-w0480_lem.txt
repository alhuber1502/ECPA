to pretty mrs. H.  d. upon the sight of her picture stand among other at mr. kneller.

i 

COrrinna when you leave the town,
my heart secure i think to find,
but find alas-new chain put on,
by your bright image leave behind.

ii.

your picture now the conquest have,
to my fond soul new flame return,
like ray contract in a glass,
though distant your reflection burn.

iii.

have paradise for you be lose,
like Adam i have suffer too,
what must that fruit be to the taste,
that be so tempt to the view?

iv.

your grace shine at full length,
subdue each soul devout skill,
when beauty charm beyond our strength,
where be the use of our free will?

v. 

like that astronomer i gaze,
that his propitious star have find,
fix my eye upon your face,
i slight the glitter planet round.

vi.

and as to shrine when pilgrim go,
such awful reverence i feel,
that though i be sure it be only show,
i scarce can forbear to kneel.
