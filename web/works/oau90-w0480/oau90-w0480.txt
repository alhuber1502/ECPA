To pretty Mrs. H. D. upon the sight of her Picture standing amongst other at Mr. Knellers.

I.

COrrinna when you left the Town,
My Heart secure I thought to find,
But found alas-new Chains put on,
By your bright Image left behind.

II.

Your Picture now the Conquest has,
To my fond Soul new flame returns,
Like Rays contracted in a Glass,
Though distant your Reflection burns.

III.

Had Paradise for you been lost,
Like Adam I had suffer'd too,
What must that Fruit be to the Taste,
That is so tempting to the view?

IV.

Your Graces shining at full length,
Subdue each Souls devoutest skill,
When Beauty Charms beyond our strength,
Where is the use of our free Will?

V.

Like that Astronomer I gaze,
That his propitious Star had found,
Fixing my Eyes upon your Face,
I slight the glittering Planets round.

VI.

And as to Shrines when Pilgrims go,
Such awful Reverence I feel,
That though I'm sure 'tis only show,
I scarcely can forbear to kneel.
