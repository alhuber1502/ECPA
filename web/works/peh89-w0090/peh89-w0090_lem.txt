a pastoral. [as thirsis and Daphne, upon the new hay]

as thirsis and Daphne, upon the new hay
 be seat, survey the plain;
 no guilt in their bosom their joy to allay,
 or give they a moment of pain. 

not Venus, but virtue have make they her care,
 she teach they her innocent skill;
 the swain know no art, but to pleasure the fair
 that nature have form to his will. 

inspire by love, on his pipe he do play;
 o virtue! how happy the swain! 
while sweet robin-red-breast that perch on the spray,
 and Daphne be please with the strain. 

how please the prospect, how cool the breeze;
 the sun shine delightful 'round;
 and apple half ripe, grow so thick on the tree,
 the bough almost bend to the ground. 

thus happy seat, by sympathy bind,
 how please the mutual chain;
 when either be absent, the prospect around
 display all their beauty in vain. 

they sit till the mist that arise from the brook,
 inform they the evening be nigh;
 the swain shake his head with a languish look,
 and 'rise from his seat with a sigh. 

his flute he disjointed, and silent a while
 he gaze on his maid with delight;
 then give she his hand, she arise with a smile,
 he kiss she, and bid her good night.
