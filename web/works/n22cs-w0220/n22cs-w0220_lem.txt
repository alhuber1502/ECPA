sonnet [22] xxii. by the same. to solitude. 

oh, solitude; to thy sequester vale
 i come to hide my sorrow and my tear,
 and to thy echo tell the mournful tale
 which scarce i trust to pity friendship ear! 
amid thy wild wood, and untrodden glade,
 no sound but those of melancholy move;
 and the low wind that die among thy shade,
 seem like soft pity sigh, for hopeless love! 
and sure some story of despair and pain,
 in yond deep copse, thy murmur dove relate;
 and hark! methinks in that long plaintive strain,
 thy own sweet songstress weep my wayward fate! 
ah, nymph! that fate assist i to endure,
 and bear awhile â€” what death alone can cure!
