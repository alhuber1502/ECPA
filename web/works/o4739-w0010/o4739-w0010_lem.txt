write the morning after ANNA matilda return from a friend house,

close on the verge of Windsor forest. 

have i then leave you, sweet hygeian bower —
 oh! have i leave you friendship holy hour? 
why be you vanish, dear invite shade? 
why cease, the cheer music of your glade? 

not that which on the surge aether float,
 or tremble in the linnet gurgle note; —
 but that which give you Harriet polish mind,
 her sense reflective, and her taste refine;
 that, which your venerable dryad love,
 when midst their haunt they see her graceful move;
 that which adorn the clear, strong sense,
 and clothes in light dress, the thought intense.
