contentment.

by the same.

farewell aspire thought, no more
my soul shall leave the peaceful shore,
to sail ambition main;
fallacious as the harlot kiss,
you promise i uncertain bliss,
and give i certain pain.

a beauteous prospect first you show,
which ere survey you paint anew,
and paint it wondrous pleasant:
this in a third be quick lose:
thus future good we covet most,
but never enjoy the present.

delude on from scene to scene,
we never end, but still begin,
by flatter hope betray;
i be weary of the painful chace,
let other run this endless race
to catch a fly shade.

let other boast their useless wealth;
have i not honesty and health?
which riches can give:
let other to preferment soar,
and, change liberty for power,
in golden shackle live.

it be time, at length, i shall be wise,
it be time to seek substantial joy;
joy out of Fortune power:
wealth, honour, dignity, and fame,
be toy the blind capricious dame
take from we every hour.

come, conscious virtue, fill my breast,
and bring content, thy daughter, dress
in ever-smiling charm:
let sacred friendship too attend;
a friendship worthy of my friend,
such as my Laelius warm.

with these i will in my bosom make
a bulwark fortune can shake,
though all her storm arise;
look down and pity gild slave,
despise ambition giddy knave,
and wish the fool be wise.
