PENANCE.

A Drunken old Scot by the rigorous sentence
Of the kirk was condemn'd to the stool of repentance.
Mess John to his conscience his vices put home,
And his danger in this, and the world that's to come.
Thou reprobate mortal; why, dost not thou know
Whither, after your death, all you drunkards must go?
Must go when we're dead? why Sir, you may swear,
We shall go, one and all, where we find the best beer.
