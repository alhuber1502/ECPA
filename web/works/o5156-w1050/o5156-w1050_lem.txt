penance.

a drunken old Scot by the rigorous sentence
of the kirk be condemn to the stool of repentance.
mess John to his conscience his vice put home,
and his danger in this, and the world that be to come.
thou reprobate mortal; why, do not thou know
whither, after your death, all you drunkard must go?
must go when we be dead? why sir, you may swear,
we shall go, one and all, where we find the best beer.
