sonnet.

trouble ocean! trouble ocean!
thou calm gale shall sooth to rest;
but what shall smooth that keen motion,
that rankle in my anxious breast.

dark cloud the azure sky obscure,
wind waft they, and fair sun appear;
but when my cloud eye be weep,
can aught disperse the bitter tear.

to sable night for phebus mourning,
Cynthia lend her placid beam;
oh say! what dawn of hope return,
on my sorrow heart shall gleam?

thou pliant willow, pliant willow,
that bend and rise from the storm;
so can i rise from that rude billow,
which will overwhelm i in the storm.

oh! come then heavenly resignation,
and bear i in the adverse stream;
till to celestial bliss i waken,
from life as from a painful dream.
