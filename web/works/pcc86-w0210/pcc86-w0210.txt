A BALLAD.

I.

IF Flavia's eyes, or Stella's soul,
 Were in my choice to take,
 I would not envy Flavia's eyes,
 But only for thy sake. 

II.

But if a Stella please thee more,
 That Stella I would be;
 For sure a Flavia could not gain,
 Or keep a swain like thee. 

III.

But ah! would Stella ever tell? 
A stranger as thou art;
 Would Stella envy Flavia's eyes? 
Alone to gain thy heart. 

IV.

I scarcely knew from whence thou came. 
Would Stella thought like me? 
Too soon I thought — thou didst depart;
 Would Stella told it thee. 

V.

But sure my hand — thou ne'er hast seen,
 My name thou ne'er shalt know;
 And while I praise thy nameless art,
 I can thy love forego. 

VI.

My favourite pigeon too he prais'd. 
I mind each word he spake;
 I'd give it him — but since he's gone,
 I'll keep it for his sake. 

VII.

Go, gentle swain, and unconfin'd;
 Or, if you think of me,
 Here I with pleasure can submit,
 If that's approv'd by thee. 

VIII.

Long did I look down a' the way,
 As far as I could see;
 And art thou gone — ah! what are all
 The rustic swains to me? 

IX.

Go, gentle swain — and to our sex
 Polite attention pay;
 Nor ever dangerous flattery try,
 Nor vain neglect essay. 

X.

The giddy empty fluttering fool,
 May catch a Flavia's eyes;
 But real good sense, and such as you,
 Alone can Stella please.
