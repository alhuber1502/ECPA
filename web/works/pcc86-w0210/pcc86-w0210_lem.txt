a ballad.

i 

if flavia eye, or stella soul,
 be in my choice to take,
 i will not envy flavia eye,
 but only for thy sake. 

ii.

but if a Stella please thou more,
 that Stella i will be;
 for sure a Flavia can not gain,
 or keep a swain like thou. 

iii.

but ah! will Stella ever tell? 
a stranger as thou be;
 will Stella envy flavia eye? 
alone to gain thy heart. 

iv.

i scarce know from whence thou come. 
will Stella think like i? 
too soon i think — thou do depart;
 will Stella tell it thou. 

v. 

but sure my hand — thou never have see,
 my name thou never shall know;
 and while i praise thy nameless art,
 i can thy love forgo. 

vi.

my favourite pigeon too he praise. 
i mind each word he speak;
 i will give it he — but since he be go,
 i will keep it for his sake. 

vii.

go, gentle swain, and unconfined;
 or, if you think of i,
 here i with pleasure can submit,
 if that be approve by thou. 

viii.

long do i look down all the way,
 as far as i can see;
 and be thou go — ah! what be all
 the rustic swain to i? 

ix.

go, gentle swain — and to our sex
 polite attention pay;
 nor ever dangerous flattery try,
 nor vain neglect essay. 

x. 

the giddy empty flutter fool,
 may catch a flavia eye;
 but real good sense, and such as you,
 alone can Stella please.
