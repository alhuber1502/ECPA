hymn to contempt.

i 

welcome, contempt! stern, faithful guide,
 unplease, healthful food! 
hail pride-sprung antidote of pride,
 hail evil turn to good! 

ii.

thou when with awful pomp array
 ill-judging mortal see,
 perverse they fly with coward speed,
 to guilt they fly from thou. 

iii.

yet if one haply longing stand
 to choose a noble part,
 ardent from sin ensnare band
 to vindicate his heart:

iv.

present to end the doubtful strife,
 thy aid he soon shall feel;
 confirm by thou, though warm in life,
 bid the vain world farewell. 

v. 

through thou he tread the shine way
 that saint and martyr tread,
 shake off the frailty of his clay,
 and wing his soul for god. 

vi.

his portion thou, he burn no more,
 with fond desire to please;
 the fierce, distract conflict over
 and all his thought be peace. 

vii.

send by almighty pity down,
 to thou alone it be give
 with glorious infamy to crown
 the favourite of heaven. 

viii.

with thou heaven favourite son, when make
 incarnate, deign to abide;
 to thou he meek bow his head,
 he bow his head, and die. 

ix.

and shall i still the cup decline,
 his suffering disesteem,
 disdain to make this portion mine
 when sanctify by he? 

x. 

or firm through he and undismayed,
 thy sharp dart abide? 
sharp as the thorn that tear his head,
 the spear that pierce his side. 

xi.

yes â€” since with thou my lot be cast,
 i bless my god decree,
 embrace with joy what he embrace,
 and live and die with thou! 

xii.

so when before the angelic host
 to each his lot be give,
 thy name shall be in glory lose,
 and i be find in heaven!
