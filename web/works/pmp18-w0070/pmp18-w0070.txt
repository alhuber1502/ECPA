TO THE LADY DURSLEY On the same Subject.

Here reading how fond Adam was betray'd;
 And how by Sin Eve's blasted Charms decay'd;
 Our common Loss unjustly You complain;
 So small that Part of it, which You sustain. 

You still, fair Mother, in your Offspring trace
 The Stock of Beauty destin'd for the Race:
 Kind Nature, forming Them, the Pattern took
 From Heav'n's first Work, and Eve's Original Look. 

You, happy Saint, the Serpent's Pow'r controul:
 Scarce any actual Guilt defiles your Soul:
 And Hell does o'er that Mind vain Triumph boast,
 Which gains a Heav'n, for Earthly Eden lost. 

With Virtue strong as Your's had Eve been arm'd,
 In vain the Fruit had blush'd, or Serpent charm'd:
 Nor had our Bliss by Penitence been bought:
 Nor had frail Adam fall'n, nor Milton wrote.
