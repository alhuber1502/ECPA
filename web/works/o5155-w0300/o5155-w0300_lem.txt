verse write in a garden.

by lady m. W. m. 

see how that pair of bill dove
with open murmur own their love;
and heedless of censorious eye,
pursue their unpolluted joy:
no fear of future want molest
the downy quiet of their nest;
no interest join the happy pair,
secure bless in nature care,
while her dear dictate they pursue:
for constancy be nature too.

can all the doctrine of our school,
our maxim, our religious rule,
can learning to our life ensure
virtue so bright, or bliss so pure?
the great creator happy end,
virtue and pleasure ever blend:
in vain the church and court have try
the unite essence to divide;
alike they find their wild mistake,
the pedant priest, and giddy rake.
