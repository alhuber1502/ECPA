great Homer birth seven rival city claim,
too mighty such monopoly of fame;
yet not to birth alone do Homer owe
his wondrous worth; what Egypt can bestow,
with all the school of Greece and Asia join,
enlarge the immense expansion of his mind.
nor yet unrivalled the maeonian strain,
the british eagle, and the mantuan swan
tower equal height. but happy Stratford, thou
with incontested laurel deck thy brow:
thy bard be thy unschooled, and from thou bring
more than all Egypt, Greece, or Asia teach.
not Homer self such matchless honour win;
the greek have rival, but thy Shakespear none.
