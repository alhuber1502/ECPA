a epistle, desire the queen picture.

write at Paris, 1714 . but left unfinished by the sudden news of her majesty death. 

the train of equipage and pomp of state,
 the shine side-board, and the burnish plate
 let other minister, great Anne, require;
 and partial fall thy gift to their desire. 
to the fair portrait of my sovereign dame,
 to that alone, eternal be my claim. 

my bright defender, and my dread delight,
 if ever i find favour in thy sight;
 if all the pain that for thy britain sake
 my past have take, or future life may take,
 be grateful to my queen; permit my prayer,
 and with this gift reward my total care. 

will thy indulgent hand, fair saint, allow
 the boon? and will thy ear accept the vow? 
that in despite of age, of impious flame,
 and eat time, thy picture like thy fame
 entire may last; that as their eye survey
 the semblant shade, man yet unborn may say;
 thus great, thus gracious look britannia queen;
 her brow thus smooth, her look be thus serene;
 when to a low, but to a loyal hand
 the mighty empress give her high command,
 that he to hostile camp, and king shall haste,
 to speak her vengeance as their danger past;
 to say, she will detest war to cease;
 she check her conquest, for her subject ease;
 and bid the world attend her term of peace. 

thou, gracious Anne, thou present i adore,
 thou, queen of peace â€” if time and fate have power
 high to raise the glory of thy reign;
 in word sublime, and a noble strain,
 may future bard the mighty theme rehearse. 
here, Stator Jove, and Phoebus king of verse,
 the votive tablet i suspend ****
