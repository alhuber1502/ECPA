a winter thought.

by J. earl.

i 

the man who constitution strong,
and free from vex care his mind,
as change season pass along
can in they all fresh pleasure find.

ii.

not only in the teem bud,
the open leaf, and follow bloom,
(urge by the sap ascend flood)
and fruit fair knit in its room;

iii.

not only when the smile field
in all their gaity appear,
and the perfume their bosom yield
on balmy wing the zephyr bear.

iv.

in morning fair, in evening mild,
the murmur brook, and cool shade,
bird airy note in consort wild,
and philomela serenade.

v. 

not only in the wave ear,
and branch bend with their load,
or while the produce of the year
be gather, and in safety stow.

vi.

he please, in day autumnal see
the shadowy leaf diversify
with various colour, and the tree
strip, and stand forth in naked pride.

vii.

each hollow blast, and hasty shower,
the rattle hail, and fleecy snow,
the candy rhyme, and scatter hoar,
and icicle which downward grow.

viii.

the shine pavement of the flood,
to which the youthful tribe resort,
and game, which the discover wood
expose to the fowler sport.

ix.

the green, which wintery blast defy,
through native strength, or human care,
in hedge, or close arrangery,
all these a source of pleasure be.

x. 

the sun which from the northern sign
scorch with unsufferable heat,
now in a mild glory shine,
and every glance ray be sweet.

xi.

the silver morn, and each fair star
forth to the best advantage shine,
and by the rich scene prepare
for noble thought the enlarge mind.

xii.

he, when the morning slow rise,
can sweet pass the night away
in lucubration with the wise,
or conversation with the gay.

xiii.

and when the winter tedious grow,
and lengthen day cold strong bring,
a new increase pleasure flow,
from expectation of the spring.

xiv.

so he who faculty be sound,
his heart upright and conscience clean,
agreeable can pass his round
of life, in every shift scene.

XV. 

not only in his youthful prime,
and while his power continue firm,
but when he feel the effect of time,
and age prepare he for the worm.

xvi.

grateful for every blessing past,
patient in every present ill;
and on whatever ground he be place,
hope do with please prospect fill;

xvii.

and faith in heaven enchant love
(from whence that sun will soon appear
who smile make endless spring above)
do all his damp, and darkness clear,
