A WINTER THOUGHT.

By J. EARL.

I.

THE man whose constitution's strong,
And free from vexing cares his mind,
As changing seasons pass along
Can in them all fresh pleasures find.

II.

Not only in the teeming bud,
The opening leaf, and following bloom,
(Urg'd by the sap's ascending flood)
And fruit fair knitting in its room;

III.

Not only when the smiling fields
In all their gaity appear,
And the perfumes their bosom yields
On balmy wings the zephyrs bear.

IV.

In morning fair, in evening mild,
The murm'ring brook, and cooling shade,
Birds airy notes in consorts wild,
And Philomela's serenade.

V.

Not only in the waving ear,
And branches bending with their load,
Or whilst the produce of the year
Is gathering, and in safety stow'd.

VI.

He pleas'd, in days autumnal sees
The shadowy leaf diversify'd
With various colours, and the trees
Stripp'd, and stand forth in naked pride.

VII.

Each hollow blast, and hasty show'r,
The rattling hail, and fleecy snow,
The candy'd rime, and scatter'd hoar,
And icicles which downward grow.

VIII.

The shining pavement of the flood,
To which the youthful tribes resort,
And game, which the discover'd wood
Exposes to the fowler's sport.

IX.

The greens, which wintry blasts defy,
Thro' native strength, or human care,
In hedge, or close arrangery,
All these a source of pleasure are.

X.

The sun which from the northern signs
Scorch'd with unsufferable heat,
Now in a milder glory shines,
And every glancing ray is sweet.

XI.

The silver morn, and each fair star
Forth to the best advantage shine,
And by the richest scene prepare
For noble thoughts th' enlarged mind.

XII.

He, when the mornings slowest rise,
Can sweetly pass the nights away
In lucubration with the wise,
Or conversation with the gay.

XIII.

And when the winter tedious grows,
And length'ning days cold stronger bring,
A new increasing pleasure flows,
From expectation of the spring.

XIV.

So he whose faculties are sound,
His heart upright and conscience clean,
Agreeably can pass his round
Of life, in ev'ry shifting scene.

XV.

Not only in his youthful prime,
And whilst his pow'rs continue firm,
But when he feels th' effect of time,
And age prepares him for the worm.

XVI.

Grateful for every blessing past,
Patient in every present ill;
And on whatever ground he's plac'd,
Hope does with pleasing prospects fill;

XVII.

And faith in heav'n's enchanting love
(From whence that Sun will soon appear
Whose smiles make endless spring above)
Does all his damps, and darkness clear,
