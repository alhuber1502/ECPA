to Amanda,

on her recovery from sickness. 

when April turn his watery eye,
that stain his infant cheek with tear,
and beneath a golden sky,
the bloom may appear;
wake by the tear which April shed,
gay Flora leave her sleep bed,
and call her beauteous train,
to hail a scene, so sweet, so fair,
each artless warbler fill the air
with a enchant strain.

sad philomela mournful song,
chaste cynthia silver beam invite,
melodious to speak her wrong,
to the pale shade of night.
while the shrill lark salute the morn,
and hail the god of day return,
with many a sprightly lay;
gay flower present their fragrant bloom,
mild zephyr catch the rich perfume,
to scent the open day.

not the sweet warbler of the grove,
nor the shrill lark exalt strain;
hail more please the scene they love,
more welcome Flora train,
than i, when health her rose shed,
upon amanda droop head,
and raise her languid frame;
will bid my muse, her transport show,
and paint the sympathetic glow,
inspire by friendship name.

not flower more free spread their bloom,
more free their rich fragrance bring,
the gentle zephyr to perfume,
and deck the lap of spring,
than will i now cull every sweet,
hygeia lovely form to greet,
and bless that heal power,
who open on amanda sight,
rejoice friend, renew delight,
lead by each golden hour.

far gay garland i have weave,
but sullen grief, and anxious care;
steal they from the hand of love,
and place a cypress there. 
sportive, as fancy frolic dream,
Euphrosyne have grace my theme,
my cheerful lyre have string;
but grief and fear oppose her reign,
and philomela pensive strain,
must hang upon my tongue.
