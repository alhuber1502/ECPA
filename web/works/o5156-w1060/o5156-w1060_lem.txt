by the same.

a cannon ball, one bloody day,
take a poor sailor leg away;
and, as on 'his comrade back he make off,
a second fair take his head off.
the fellow, on this odd emergence,
carry he pickback to the surgeon.

z—ds! cry the doctor, be you drink,
to bring i here a headless trunk?

a lie dog! cry jack, — he say
his leg be off, and not his head.
