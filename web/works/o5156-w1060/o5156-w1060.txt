The MISTAKE.

By the Same.

A Cannon ball, one bloody day,
Took a poor sailor's leg away;
And, as on 'his comrade's back he made off,
A second fairly took his head off.
The fellow, on this odd emergence,
Carries him pick-back to the surgeons.

Z—ds! cries the Doctor, are you drunk,
To bring me here an headless trunk?

A lying dog! cries Jack, — he said
His leg was off, and not his head.
