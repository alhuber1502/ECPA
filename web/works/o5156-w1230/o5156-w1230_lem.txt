martial, book iv. ep. 87. 

will thou, by attic taste approve,
by all be read, by all be love,
to learned Harris curious eye,
by i advise, dear Muse, apply:
in he the perfect judge you will find,
in he the candid friend, and kind.
if he repeat, if he approve,
if he the laugh muscle move,
thou nor the critic sneer shalt mind,
nor be to pie or trunk consign.
if he condemn, away you fly,
and mount in paper kite the sky,
or dead among grubstreet record lie.
