a epigram on the same occasion.

so little give at chapel door! —
 this people doubtless must be poor:
 so much at game throw away! —
 no nation sure so rich as they. 
briton, it be great for your glory,
 shall those, who shall transmit your story,
 their notion of your grandeur frame,
 not as you give, but as you game.
