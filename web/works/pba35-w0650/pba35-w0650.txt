An Epigram on the same Occasion.

So little giv'n at Chapel Door! —
 This People doubtless must be poor:
 So much at Gaming thrown away! —
 No Nation sure so rich as they. 
Britons, 'twere greatly for your Glory,
 Should those, who shall transmit your Story,
 Their Notions of your Grandeur frame,
 Not as you give, but as you game.
