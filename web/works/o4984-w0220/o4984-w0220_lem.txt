ode to taste.

by the same.

say, goddess, will thou never smile
 indulgent on britannia isle! 
hither thy genty footstep bend,
 on albion sea-girt cliff descend;
 o come, and with thy genial ray
 chase every gloomy cloud away:
 no more shall ignorance preside,
 or gothic rage in triumph ride. 
let judgement, thy unshaken friend,
 with polish elegance attend:
 simplicity, meek rural queen,
 with downcast look and modest mien,
 in loosely-flowing neat attire,
 shall charm thou with her rustic lyre. 
to that in her enchant court
 the frolic grace ever sport,
 and guard by their watchful aid,
 the fine art shall never fade. 

bless power! who charm alone dispense
 a keen rapture to each sense:
 if melody enchant my breast,
 or soothe my soften soul to rest:
 by thou may every strain be crown,
 may thou still harmonise each sound,
 if bloom colour seem to live,
 may you fresh life and vigour give;
 may you restrain each poet rage,
 or animate his pure page. 
do thou his savage wrath appease,
 even terror giant-form can please;
 amid shadowy shape in dead of night,
 that shoot across my dazzle sight;
 amid spectre of enormous size,
 amid ghost that from their charnel rise,
 amid shroud friend who solemn stalk,
 and haunt i in my midnight walk;
 while wild wind bluster round my head,
 inspire i with poetic dread;
 through close shade over valley green,
 may thou still solemnise the scene;
 and as the storm innoxious roll,
 pour thy love horror over my soul. 

yet not alone britannia shore
 thy fatal absence shall deplore. 
see old achaia genius mourn,
 his bosom bare, his garment tear;
 see his generous patriot breast
 by all his country wrong oppress. 
see he with haughty fix disdain
 lament his dastard son in vain! 
to fair happy clime belong
 the painter tint, the poet song. 
lo! conscious of approach night:
 where picture wing her destine flight. 
behold deject sculpture stand
 prepare to leave our desert land. 
yet, goddess, yet thy secret fire
 with wonder rapture we admire. 
by thou amid rugged rock we find
 each speak passion of the mind. 
with awful horror we behold
 the immense alcides monstrous mould;
 while Venus, queen of soft desire,
 each tender gentle thought inspire. 

o Alexander, not alone
 the warrior skill to thou be know. 
fair science, heaven-descended maid,
 confess thy propitious aid:
 to thou the grateful art shall raise
 eternal monument of praise. 
behold with thou they die away,
 to roman ignorance a prey
 and lo! again in conquer Rome
 with all their usual vigour bloom;
 again they feel the fatal blow,
 and sink beneath the vandal foe. 
once more the art begin to spread;
 once more gay science rear her head:
 alas! in vain she strive to assuage
 the enthusiast zealot bigot rage. 
will thou, o taste, again appear,
 protectress of each circle year! 
will thou in all thy wonted prime
 review this lose unhallowed clime;
 or where far distant region lie,
 amid dreary desert bloom and die! 
say, shall the stern olympian god
 no more in live marble nod! 
shall never Raphael charm the heart,
 shall never nature yield to art,
 shall never maro beauty shine,
 except in Armstrong classic line! 
and do not Leo now remain,
 who yet shall cheer thy droop train! 
there be, who still thy aid implore,
 who still thy sovereign power adore,
 thy relict with religious fear
 fond Italy shall yet revere. 

sweet power, in simple pomp array
 be all thy native charm display. 
again revive sculpture breathe;
 fair science trim her blast wreath;
 with suppliant will hand to thou
 the pencil picture shall decree:
 with one consent the muse choir
 to thou shall dedicate the lyre. 

come, goddess, feast my longing sight,
 let i direct thy please flight;
 whatever voluptuous slave can boast
 on fair phaeacia sunny coast,
 whatever the poet fancy teach,
 or image to his wanton thought:
 for thou a happy fate remain;
 you still shall view more blissful plain,
 where the soft guardian of thy charm
 expect thou to his longing arm:
 he shall with fix attention gaze,
 shall crown thou with immortal bay,
 with lenient hand thy care assuage,
 protect thou from time be lawless rage,
 the taunt of scorn, the dark revile,
 the languid, faint-approving smile,
 the noise of mirth, the plaintive sigh,
 and simper folly heedless eye. 

will thou with innocence reside,
 behold the temple modest pride;
 or in the darksome cavern cell
 with solitary hermit dwell;
 will thou with faint despond air
 to melancholy vault repair,
 with ache, sicken, cold review,
 bid every sorrow stream anew:
 here may thou weep thy favourite Rome,
 sad-sighing over each martyr tomb;
 meek pity, attic maid, shall join
 her tender social tear with thy,
 over every urn fresh laurel strow,
 and fond emulate thy woe. 
or will thou new world survey,
 where darkness hold her barren sway,
 where never the muse chaplet blow,
 where learning laurel never grow;
 where nature to our wonder eye
 each salutary herb supply:
 where flower their fragrant sweet diffuse,
 where tree distil their kindly dew;
 and bless with every power to heal,
 soft slumber over the sense steal. 
in such enchant, artless scene,
 amid bowery maze, spread green,
 soothe by the breezy western gale,
 in scent grove, or rocky dale,
 or wander from the russet cot,
 to seek the deep embosom grot,
 beneath the orange shade enclose,
 or in the myrtle bower repose,
 or where the flaunt flower have weave
 with mingle sweet the high alcove,
 each indian woo his favourite mate;
 what nature dictate they relate:
 no youth by love cold art be win;
 nor maid by easy faith undo;
 with eye upraise the simple swain
 dread not the torture of disdain,
 but, kneel at his fair one foot,
 breathe vow unconscious of deceit:
 each please sound she sigh to hear
 repeat on her longing ear;
 amaze, nor anxious to control
 the mutual wish of her soul,
 attest each unknown power above,
 as witness of her spotless love;
 yet rack by fond distrustful fear
 pour out her ache heart in tear,
 and tell to her admire youth
 sweet tale of innocence and truth. 

fancy such rapture shall suggest,
 love inmate of thy ravish breast;
 shall point where wanton zephyr stray,
 and over the unruffled ocean play. 
or snatch thou to some wave-worn shore,
 where fierce atlantic surge roar:
 where Plata with resistless force
 through desert roll his rapid course,
 or where maranan proud lave
 waste region with his circle wave:
 where boundless oroonoko fill
 his channel from a thousand hill,
 and with regardless rage destroy;
 while twenty mouth with hideous noise,
 from some immense Peruvian steep,
 spout his vex billow to the deep. 
thus while you view the tyrant flood,
 wild dread shall chill thy loiter blood;
 and fright fancy, self-amazed,
 start at the phantom she have raise. 

shall nature simple beauty fail,
 and art gay structure more prevail,
 here too the polish dome be place,
 with each vitruvian beauty grace:
 or will thou at the early dawn
 transport thou to the dew-clad lawn;
 or from the midday fervor rove
 beneath the silent plantane grove:
 or with the fairy elf be see
 in dance on the level green:
 shall baleful war, amid loud alarm,
 amid vanquish foe, and conquer arm,
 amid host overthrow, and myriad slay,
 on Britain fix his iron reign;
 shall jove fair daughter, olived peace,
 bid the wild battle tumult cease;
 in polish ease you still shall share
 thy kind protector foster care;
 his faithful love shall still appear,
 his friendly aid shall still be near,
 his constant, his unwearied power
 shall lull thou in the balmy bower;
 shall watch thou over the dewy glade,
 and guard thou from the midnight shade. 

thou too shall all his toil repay,
 slow-lingering here with fond delay;
 here shall thou choose thy favourite seat,
 here fix thy last, thy bless retreat;
 each old athenian bloom regain,
 and here in attic splendour reign.
