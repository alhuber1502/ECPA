OBSERVATION ON THE WORKS of NATURE.

Now night submits to the encroaching day,
 And groves, and fields, put on their spring array;
 Now various flowers of various hues display'd,
 Adorn the green, or deck the lonely shade. 
These show the pow'r of the Almighty's hand;
 They spring, they blow, they sade at his command:
 United Nature does his word fulfil,
 'Tis Man alone rejects his Maker's will.
