observation on the work of nature.

now night submit to the encroach day,
 and grove, and field, put on their spring array;
 now various flower of various hue display,
 adorn the green, or deck the lonely shade. 
these show the power of the almighty hand;
 they spring, they blow, they fade at his command:
 unite nature do his word fulfil,
 it be man alone reject his maker will.
