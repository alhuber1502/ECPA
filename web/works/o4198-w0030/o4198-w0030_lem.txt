ode to miss h—l—d.

1768. 

amid the wild and dreary dell,
 the distant echo-giving bell,
 the bend mountain head;
 while evening, move through the sky,
 over the object and the eye,
 her pitchy robe do spread. 

there gentle move through the vale,
 bend before the bluster gale,
 fall apparition glide;
 while roar river echo round,
 the drear reverberate sound
 run through the mountain side:

then steal i soft to the grove,
 and sing of the nymph i love,
 sigh out my sad complaint;
 to paint the torture of my mind,
 where can the muse number find? 
ah! number be too faint! 

ah! h—l—d, empress of my heart,
 when will thy breast admit the dart,
 and own a mutual flame? 
when, wander in the myrtle grove,
 shall mutual pleasure seal our love;
 pleasure without a name? 

thou great beauty of the sex,
 when will the little god perplex
 the mansion of thy breast? 
when will thou own a flame as pure,
 as that seraphic soul endure,
 and make thy Baker bless? 

o! haste to give my passion ease,
 and bid the perturbation cease,
 that harrow up my soul! 
the joy such happiness to find,
 will make the function of my mind
 in peace and love to roll.
