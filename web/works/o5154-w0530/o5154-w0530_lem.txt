with, "doctor, why so thoughtful, pray?"

the doctor start from his place,
but soon they more familiar grow:
and then he tell his piteous case,
how trade be low, and friend be few.

"away with fear," the phantom say,
as soon as he have hear his tale:
"take my advice and mend your trade,
"we both be loser if you fail.

"go write, your wit in satire show,
"no matter, whether smart, or true;
"call ** name, the great foe
"to dullness, folly, pride, and you.

"then copy spread, there lie the trick,
"among your friend besure you send they:
"for all who read will soon grow sick,
"and when you be call upon, attend they.

"thus trade increase by degree,
"doctor, we both shall have our end:
"for you be sure to have your fee,
"and i be sure to have your friend.
