epitaph

o lovely woman, dear of thy kind,
 on who thy fond remembrance love to dwell,
 no poet pen can ever paint thy mind,
 nor tongue of mortal bear thy praise tell. 

engrave on my fond heart thy image lie,
 i have see thou bright than the rise sun,
 when from his chamber in the orient sky,
 in radiant splendour, he his course begin. 

pure and calm as look the close day,
 when every angry element do cease;
 smile in death, my best example lie,
 and seek the region of eternal peace. 

yet bode tear bedew she fade cheek,
 two weep orphan stand by her bed;
 she look their future fate, but can not speak,
 for death cold hand lie on her beauteous head.
