the moon and the comet;

a fable.

this fact be clear .... both man and woman
 prize not what be good, but what be uncommon;
 and most delight still they be,
 not with the excellent, but rare, .... 
i can of this give proof most stable,
 but, par exemple, take a fable. 

it be night .... but still a mimic day
 shine soft forth from milky way;
 for now the bright unclouded moon
 'be ride in her high noon ....' 
who, as she slow sail along,
 behold a most unusual throng
 with eye upraise devout gaze,
 and hear, "behold! see there! amaze!" 
 "what can this mean?" dame Cynthia say,
 "perhaps," and high she draw her head,
 "perhaps that i to earth tonight
 shine with unwonted beauty bright;
 and therefore mortal in amaze
 come crowd forth on i to gaze;"
 and then, .... for heavenly beauty love,
 like earthly one, applause to move, .... 
she stoop, within a lake below
 to see how look her sparkle brow:
 and as her crescent she adjust,
 she think, if mirror may be trust,
 that night, so wondrous be her beauty,
 to gaze on she be mortals' duty. 
but o! sad fall to female pride! 
she soon with wonder look descry
 it be not on her that eye be turn;
 for she no curious ardour burn;
 at she no telescope be aim,
 nor wonder at her charm proclaim; .... 
some other idol now, she find,
 have fickle man in fetter bind;
 and Cynthia be compel to own,
 unseen her matchless beauty shine. 
 "but what," she cry, "thus rival i? 
i all the star and planet see .... 
Orion have his belt in order;
 of Saturn ring bright shine the border;
 Mars sport his coat of red hue;
 the bear have put his horse to; .... 
but still, these sight so oft be see,
 there be nothing new in they i ween:
 and after all i know the cry
 be, 'they be nought when i be by .... ' 
it be strange; and i shall sure pout
 until i have find my rival out. " 
this say, she look on every side
 with eager look of wound pride,
 and round with all the spite inspect
 of conscious beauty quite neglect;
 when, lo! she see with wonder breast,
 just twinkle in the northern west,
 and dim see, since see from far,
 a rayless, misty, long-tailed star;
 while homage from her charm be ravish,
 to be on this poor comet lavish! 

W—k—e, beware! though amateur,
 and noble, artist, connoisseur,
 thy work admire, thy skill commend,
 and smile over thy canvas bend,
 thy power will be no more respect,
 thy crowd easel soon neglect,
 if ever artist shall appear
 (the comet of dame fashion sphere,)
 who work to wonder London show
 not do with finger, but with .... toe.
