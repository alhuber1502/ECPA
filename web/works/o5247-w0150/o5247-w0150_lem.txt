the advice,

a ode.

i 

beneath a myrtle spread shade,
 the sad weep Delia lie;
 soft zephyr fan the pensive maid,
 and waste every sigh away. 

ii.

dear conscious stream, she soft cry,
 who plaintive murmur sooth my pain;
 how often on thy flowery side
 do Damon at my foot complain? 

iii.

recline in yonder silent grove,
 how do the lovely youth protest
 the soft, true, fond love,
 that ever warm a faithful breast? 

iv.

but ah those vow no long bind,
 no more my gentle sway he own;
 for some coy nymph less fair and kind,
 the dear betrayer sigh and burn. 

v. 

thus mourn the fair neglect maid,
 when sprightly cloe thither come;
 and be it thus, she laugh say,
 that Delia cure a slight flame? 

vi.

no more indulge this fruitless grief;
 if damon false to you and love,
 the god that wound can bring relief,
 another may the first remove. 

vii.

believe i, friend, the cruel flame,
 which torture now thy gentle breast;
 the object change will burn the same,
 and you in mutual love be bless. 

viii.

Strephon, who all this time conceal,
 the virgin soft complaint have hear,
 his beauteous form at length reveal,
 and thus his tender vow prefer. 

ix.

if love like i that can endure,
 though the dear object be its foe;
 if absence nor disdain can cure
 a hopeless flame that burn in woe. 

x. 

if such a pure, a constant fire,
 may hope for pity in thy breast,
 Strephon shall still the heart inspire,
 that once receive he for a guest. 

xi.

Delia no more my love shall fly,
 but with return fondness own,
 that Damon merit less than i,
 who never love but she alone. 

xii.

amaze, confuse, the blush maid
 find her wrong lover still the same;
 in vain she call her pride to aid
 against the sweet return flame. 

xiii.

that melt voice, that heavenly form,
 those eye that shine with soft desire;
 each grace inspire her soul to charm,
 and kindle up the latent fire. 

xiv.

fain she will she tender thought impart,
 her bashful tongue the task deny;
 impatient to be know, her heart
 give all its softness to her eye. 

XV. 

in they soft wish stand confess,
 sweet remorse, and conscious love;
 every fear her soul possess,
 and all that can those fear remove. 

xvi.

convince, overjoy, the lovely youth
 see the reluctant please pain,
 vow at her foot eternal truth,
 bless her sway, and hug his chain.
