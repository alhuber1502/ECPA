A Poetical Question concerning the Jacobites, sent to the Athenians.

'TWas nobly thought, and worthy â€” still;

Virtue, and our unequall'd Heroes praise!

A Prince as Great, and wondrous Good, as e're

His Foes, Curst word, and why they'd pierce his breast,
 Ungrateful Vipers! where they warmly rest?
