the universal prayer.

i 

father of all! in every age,
 in every clime adore,
 by saint, by savage, and by sage,
 Jehovah, Jove, or lord! 

ii.

thou great first cause, least understand! 
who all my sense confine
 to know but this, â€” that thou be good,
 and i my self be blind:

iii.

yet give i, in this dark estate,
 to see the good from ill;
 and bind nature fast in fate,
 leave conscience free, and will. 

iv.

what conscience dictate to be do,
 or warn i not to doe,
 this, teach i more than hell to shun,
 that, more than heaven pursue. 

v. 

what blessing thy free bounty give,
 let i not cast away;
 for god be pay when man receive,
 enjoy, be to obey. 

vi.

yet not to earth contract span,
 thy goodness let i bound;
 or think thou lord alone of man,
 when thousand world be round. 

vii.

let not this weak, unknowing hand
 presume thy bolt to throw,
 and deal damnation round the land,
 on each i judge thy foe. 

viii.

if i be right, thy grace impart
 still in the right to stay;
 if i be wrong, oh teach my heart
 to find that better way. 

ix.

save i alike from foolish pride,
 or impious discontent,
 at ought thy wisdom have deny,
 or ought thy goodness lend. 

x. 

teach i to feel another woe;
 to hide the fault i see;
 that mercy i to other show,
 that mercy show to i. 

xi.

mean though i be, not whole so
 since quicken by thy breath,
 oh lead i wheresoever i go,
 through this day life, or death:

xii.

this day, be bread and peace my lot;
 all else beneath the sun,
 thou know if best bestow, or not;
 and let thy will be do. 

xiii.

to thou, who temple be all space,
 who altar, earth, sea, sky;
 one chorus let all be raise! 
all nature incense rise!
