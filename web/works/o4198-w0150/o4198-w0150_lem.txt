song to mr. G. Catcott.

1769. 

1. 

ah blame i not, Catcott, if from the right way
 my notion and action run far. 
how can my idea do other but stray,
 deprive of the rule north star? 

2. 

ah blame i not, broderip, if mount aloft,
 i chatter and spoil the dull air;
 how can i imagine thy foppery soft,
 when discord the voice of my fair? 

3. 

if Turner remit my bluster and rhyme,
 if Harding be girlish and cold,
 if never a ogle be meet from miss Grimes,
 if Flavia be blast and old;

4. 

i choose without like, and leave without pain,
 nor welcome the frown with a sigh;
 i scorn, like a monkey, to dangle my chain,
 and paint they new charm with a lie. 

5. 

once Cotton be handsome; i flame, and i burn,
 i die to obtain the bright queen;
 but when i behold my epistle return,
 by Jesus it alter the scene. 

6. 

she be damnable ugly, my vanity cry,
 you lie, say my conscience, you lie;
 resolve to follow the dictate of pride,
 i will view she a hag to my eye. 

7. 

but shall she regain her bright lustre again,
 and shine in her natural charm,
 it be but to accept of the work of my pen,
 and permit i to use my own arm.
