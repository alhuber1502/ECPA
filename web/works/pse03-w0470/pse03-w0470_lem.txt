Delia to phraartes on his mistake of three lady write to he.

say, noble youth, thou glory of the stage,
 gay soft delight of the admire age;
 what will thou give thou do thy Delia know,
 or that the nymph who write the billet deau,
 can have oblige you with heroic too? 
to purchase your esteem they all agree,
 and though one scroul, it be a tripartite deed. 
methinks in you i royal Paris see,
 like he employ ill suit your degree;
 in his disguise he rural conquest win,
 but you brave youth have great wonder do;
 your power by neither sex can be withstand,
 your own be all oblige and we subdue
 wit fortune, beauty for your voice contest,
 each with your approbation will be bless;
 for the charm nymph desire as much to please,
 as do the three contend goddess,
 that bless young Paris in the myrtle grove,
 with the nice choice of grandure wit and love. 
they will appear all eager of success,
 but be more cautious, cause their charm less,
 beside they be resolve they will not undress:
 they have only yet their mystic charm display,
 and entertain you in a masquerade;
 but beg you will not take the niceness ill,
 for they resolve to wear their visard still;
 may the soft riddle never be explain,
 lest the neglect blush to be disdain;
 shall they divide; their charm will be too small,
 be they celestial; you will merit all. 
yes, lovely youth, those mighty charm of thy,
 deserve not only what, but all that be divine:
 before nature form you, she in you design
 perfection far beyond all human kind:
 but scorn material from her common store,
 traverse her pregnant universe all over;
 pick up each soft atom as she go;
 take too those bright one next the firmament. 
thus rich furnish she the work begin,
 and joy to find it will be more than man;
 with utmost care do every charm increase,
 and ever she will complete the beauteous piece,
 dip her nice pencil in the liquid light,
 varnish the whole, till god themselves less bright,
 each deity deceive with what be do,
 bestow some gift and thought you be his own:
 so liberal they give; in you we see,
 all their perfection in epitome. 
no wonder our weak sex be charm to love
 that form which may the please object prove
 of all the wish female court above:
 it be they alone must for your heart contend,
 your triple nymph no farther do pretend,
 than to adore the glory they commend;
 they be resolve they will remain entire,
 not run the hazard of dilate fire;
 to other swain their single power may move,
 and they neglect charm to more than love. 
they know your worth; so the deserve three
 will join, and be one Delia to thou;
 let one idea fill thy grateful breast,
 think they be so, in that mistake they be bless.
