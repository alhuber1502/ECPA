to Polly Laurence, quit the pump.

bath, January 1756. 

spite of beauty, air, and grace,
with honour have thou run thy race!
in sunshine well thy part thou have play —
now, sweet Polly, seek the shade. 

the prudent general, though beat,
reap honour from a good retreat;
but noble thou, thy thousand kill,
with fly colour leave the field.

let not retirement give the spleen,
thy sex longing — to be see:
but teach the vicious and the vain,
their pleasure but refine pain.

teach the gay by thy retreat,
eternal giggle be not wit;
and the formal fool advise,
prudery can make her wise. 

take with thou to thy private state
the applause of the good and great;
the best reward below allow
of a conduct great and good.
