a prayer to Venus in her temple at Stowe. 

to the same.

i 

fair Venus, who delightful shrine survey
its front reflect in the silver lake,
these humble offering, which thy servant pay,
fresh flower, and myrtle wreath, propitious take.

ii.

if less my love exceed all other love,
than Lucy charm all other charm excel,
far from my breast each soothe hope remove,
and there let sad despair for ever dwell.

iii.

but if my soul be fill with she alone,
no other wish, nor other object know,
oh! make she, goddess, make she all my own,
and give my tremble heart secure repose.

iv.

no watchful spy i ask to guard her charm,
no wall of brass, no steel-defended door;
place she but once within my circle arm,
love sure fort, and i will doubt no more.
