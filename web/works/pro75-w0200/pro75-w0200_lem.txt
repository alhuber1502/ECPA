hymn to virtue.

i

divine inhabitant of heaven,
to who superior power be give,
ah! deign to guide my will,
teach i to shun deceit and art,
to own a feeling, generous heart,
and guard my mind from ill.

ii

when thou appear (lovely maid,)
with all thy wondrous charm display,
with modest, gentle eye,
please i behold thy matchless grace,
thy beauteous form, thy bloom face,
fair daughter of the sky.

iii

thou guide to youth, support to age,
direct the young, advise the sage,
show they the road to fame,
they who thy counsel do revere,
inspire by thou can never err,
or stain thy sacred name.

iv

if it be your wish you bloom fair,
to live content, be this your care,
make truth your constant rule,
let wise experience, teach you sense,
with modesty, and innocence,
improve in virtue school.

v

never trust to fortune, fickle dame,
nor play with honour sacred name,
be cautious how you stray,
let prudence govern all your heart,
beware of flatt'ry venom dart,
nor tread the slippery way.

vi

be it my task to sing thy praise,
in virtue cause my voice i will raise,
and all my time employ,
a recompense i large find,
a peaceful conscience, quiet mind,
a life of heartfelt joy.
