cloe hunt.

behind her neck her comely tress tie,
 her ivory quiver graceful by her side,
 a-hunting cloe go: she lose her way,
 and through the wood uncertain chance to stray. 
Apollo pass by behold the maid;
 and, sister dear, bright Cynthia turn, he say:
 the hunt hind lie close in yonder brake. 
loud Cupid laugh, to see the God mistake;
 and laugh cry, learn better, great divine,
 to know thy kindred, and to honour i. 
right advise, far hence thy sister seek,
 or on meander bank, or latmus peak. 
but in this nymph, my friend, my sister know:
 she draw my arrow, and she bend my bow:
 fair Thames she haunt, and every neighbour grove
 sacred to soft recess, and gentle love. 
go, with thy Cynthia, hurl the point spear
 at the rough boar; or chace the fly deer:
 i and my cloe take a noble aim:
 at human heart we fling, nor ever miss the game.
