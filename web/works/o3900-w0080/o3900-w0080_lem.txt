spiritual slumber.

from the german. 

i 

o thou, who all thing can control,
 chase this dead slumber from my soul;
 with joy and fear, with love and awe
 give i to keep thy perfect law. 

ii.

o may one beam of thy bless light
 pierce through, dispel the shade of night:
 touch my cold breast with heavenly fire,
 with holy, conquer zeal inspire. 

iii.

for zeal i sigh, for zeal i pant;
 yet heavy be my soul and faint:
 with step unwavering, undismayed
 give i in all thy path to tread. 

iv.

with outstretched hand, and stream eye
 oft i begin to grasp the prize;
 i groan, i strive, i watch, i pray:
 but ah! how soon it die away! 

v. 

the deadly slumber soon i feel
 afresh upon my spirit steal:
 rise, lord; stir up thy quicken power,
 and wake i that i sleep no more. 

vi.

single of heart o may i be,
 nothing may i desire but thou:
 far, far from i the world remove,
 and all that hold i from thy love!
