SPIRITUAL SLUMBER.

From the German. 

I.

O Thou, who all things canst controul,
 Chase this dead Slumber from my Soul;
 With Joy and Fear, with Love and Awe
 Give me to keep thy perfect Law. 

II.

O may one Beam of thy blest Light
 Pierce thro', dispel the Shades of Night:
 Touch my cold Breast with heav'nly Fire,
 With holy, conq'ring Zeal inspire. 

III.

For Zeal I sigh, for Zeal I pant;
 Yet heavy is my Soul and faint:
 With Steps unwav'ring, undismay'd
 Give me in all thy Paths to tread. 

IV.

With out-stretch'd Hands, and streaming Eyes
 Oft I begin to grasp the Prize;
 I groan, I strive, I watch, I pray:
 But ah! how soon it dies away! 

V.

The deadly Slumber soon I feel
 Afresh upon my Spirit steal:
 Rise, Lord; stir up thy quick'ning Pow'r,
 And wake me that I sleep no more. 

VI.

Single of Heart O may I be,
 Nothing may I desire but Thee:
 Far, far from me the World remove,
 And all that holds me from thy Love!
