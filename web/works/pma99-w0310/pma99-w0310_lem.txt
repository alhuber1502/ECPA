hymn.

to thou, all powerful and supreme,
 i tune my grateful lay,
 when such, and so divine, the theme,
 how weak be mortal praise! 

yet pardon, if in humble verse
 my 'enrapture soul aspire,
 thy wondrous goodness to rehearse,
 thy greatness to admire. 

let my overflow heart discharge
 in prayer and praise to thou
 some small return for gift so large
 bestow each day on i. 

ah, what be i, that thou shall deign
 to visit my sad heart? 
and why vouchsafe, when i complain,
 such solace to impart? 

it be in the word of life i meet
 a cure for every grief,
 it be ever to thy mercy-feat
 i fly to seek relief. 

i find it there, i feel a flame
 within my bosom glow,
 i call upon my saviour name,
 and triumph over woe. 

vain be the world unkindness, vain
 misfortune utmost spite,
 while still i keep amid grief and pain
 thy mercy in my sight. 

i know that my redeemer live,
 i know that he can save,
 let he take back the life he give,
 i will seek he in the grave.
