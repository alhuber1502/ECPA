The Pennance.

Nymph Fanarett, suppos'd to be
The Gentlest, most indulgent She;
(For what Offence I cannot say)
A Day and Night, and half a Day,
Banisht her Shepheard from her sight:
Sure his Default cou'd not be Light,
Or this Compassionate Judge had nere
Impos'd a Pennance so severe.
And lest she shou'd anon revoke
What in her warmer rage she spoke,
She bound the Sentence with an Oath,
Protested by her Faith and Troth,
Nought shou'd Compound for his Offence,
But the full Term of Abstinence. 
But when his Pennance-Glass were run,
His Hours of Castigation done,
Shou'd he deferr one Minutes space
T' appear, and be restor'd to Grace,
With sparkling threatning Eyes she swore,
That Failure wou'd Incense her more
Than all his Trespasses before.
