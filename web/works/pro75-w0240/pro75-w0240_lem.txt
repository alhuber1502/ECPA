to Aurelia on her go abroad.

farewell, my friend, good angel waft thou over,
and guard thou safe to italia shore.
propitious power on all thy step await,
mild as thy gentle bosom — be thy fate.
serene and calm be every moment past,
may each revolve day approve the last;
pure as thyself may all thy friendship prove.
and may thou find sincerity in love.

to fickle man — for few alas be just.
if at love altar you resign your heart,
let well try constancy direct the dart.
may sweet contentment crown the fleet hour,
and strew thy path with ever bloom flower.
may no unwelcome pain disturb thy rest,
no anxious care invade thy generous breast;
but every earthly bliss on thou attend,
and keep from insult my much honour friend.
when thou be land on the distant isle,
think of our friendship past, and deign to smile:
for know aurelia love i value more,
then all the gem of india wealthy shore.
the law of sacred virtue still protect,
nor let my friendship meet a cold neglect.
let not sad absence banish from thy mind,
those faithful vow which once our heart do bind.
those generous tie of truth, ah! never resign,
for seldom love be more sincere than i;
i boast no more than truth have power to impart,
a faithful, feeling, undissembling heart.
seek not the splendid care of shine court,
for hide sorrow with the great resort.
unbidden grief lurk in the dark disguise,
and heaven-born peace her cheer ray deny.
sweet mediocrity to thou alone,
superior joy be most distinct know.
bestow your choice gift you sacred nine,
on great soul — simplicity be i.
