epigram.

frank carve very ill, yet will palm all the meat:
 he eat more than six; and drink more than he eat. 
four pipe after dinner he constant smoke;
 and season his whif with impertinent joke. 
yet sigh, he say, we must certain break;
 and my cruel unkindness compel he to speak:
 for of late i invite he â€” but four time a week.
