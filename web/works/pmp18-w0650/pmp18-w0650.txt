EPIGRAM.

Frank Carves very ill, yet will palm all the Meats:
 He Eats more than Six; and Drinks more than he Eats. 
Four Pipes after Dinner he constantly smokes;
 And seasons his Whifs with impertinent Jokes. 
Yet sighing, he says, We must certainly break;
 And my cruel Unkindness compells him to speak:
 For of late I invite Him â€” but Four Times a Week.
