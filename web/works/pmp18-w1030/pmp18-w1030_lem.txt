Gualterus DANISTONUS.

ad amicos. imitate.

studious the busy moment to deceive,
 that fleet between the cradle and the grave,
 i credit what the graecian dictate say,
 and samian sound over scotia hill convey. 
when mortal man resign his transient breath;
 the body only i give over to death. 
the part dissolve, and break frame i mourn:
 what come from earth, i see to earth return. 
the immaterial part, th'Ã¦thereal soul,
 nor can change vanquish, nor can death control. 
glad i release it from it be partner care;
 and bid good angel waft it to the star. 
then in the flow bowl i drown those sigh,
 which, spite of wisdom, from our weakness rise. 
the draught to the dead memory i commend,
 and offer to the now immortal friend. 
but if oppose to what my thought approve,
 nor Pluto rage there be, nor power of Jove;
 on it be dark side if thou the prospect take;
 grant all forget beyond black lethe lake:
 in total death suppose the mortal lie,
 no new hereafter, nor a future sky:
 yet bear thy lot content; yet cease to grieve:
 why, ever death come, do thou forbear to live? 
the little time thou have, betwixt instant now
 and fate approach, be all the god allow:
 and of this little have thou ought to spare
 to sad reflection, and corrod care? 
the moment past, if thou be wise, retrieve
 with pleasant memory of the bliss they give. 
the present hour in present mirth employ;
 and bribe the future with the hope of joy. 
the future (few or more, how ever they be)
 be destine erst; nor can by fate decree
 be now cut off, betwixt the grave and thou.
