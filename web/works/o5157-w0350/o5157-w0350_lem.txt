answer.

too timorous maid! can time or chance
a pure ingenuous flame controul?
o lay aside that tender glance,
that melt my frame, that kill my soul!

be but thy outward charm admire,
frail origin of female sway!
my flame like other flame inspire,
may then like other flame decay:

but while thy mind shall seem thus fair,
thy soul unfading charm be see;
thou may resign that shape and air,
yet find thy swain â€” a evergreen.
