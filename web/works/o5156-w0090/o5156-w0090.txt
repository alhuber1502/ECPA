ANACREONTIC,

1738.

By the Same.

'TWAS in a cool Aonian glade,
The wanton Cupid, spent with toil,
Had sought refreshment from the shade;
And stretch'd him on the mossy soil.

A vagrant Muse drew nigh, and found
The subtle traitor fast asleep;
And is it thine to snore profound,
She said, yet leave the world to weep?

But hush — from this auspicious hour,
The world, I ween, may rest in peace;
And robb'd of darts, and stript of pow'r,
Thy peevish petulance decrease.

Sleep on, poor child! whilst I withdraw,
And this thy vile artillery hide —
When the Castalian fount she saw,
And plung'd his arrows in the tide.

That magic fount — ill-judging maid!
Shall cause you soon to curse the day
You dar'd the shafts of Love invade;
And gave his arms redoubled sway.

For, in a stream so wonderous clear,
When angry Cupid searches round,
Will not the radiant points appear?
Will not the furtive spoils be found?

Too soon they were; and every dart,
Dipt in the Muse's mystic spring,
Acquir'd new force to wound the heart;
And taught at once to love and sing. 

Then farewell ye Pierian quire;
For who will now your altars throng?
From Love we learn to swell the lyre;
And Echo asks no sweeter song.
