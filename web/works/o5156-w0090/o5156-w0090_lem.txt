anacreontic,

1738. 

by the same.

it be in a cool aonian glade,
the wanton Cupid, spend with toil,
have seek refreshment from the shade;
and stretch he on the mossy soil.

a vagrant muse draw nigh, and find
the subtle traitor fast asleep;
and be it thy to snore profound,
she say, yet leave the world to weep?

but hush — from this auspicious hour,
the world, i ween, may rest in peace;
and rob of dart, and strip of power,
thy peevish petulance decrease.

sleep on, poor child! while i withdraw,
and this thy vile artillery hide —
when the castalian fount she see,
and plunge his arrow in the tide.

that magic fount — ill-judging maid!
shall cause you soon to curse the day
you dare the shaft of love invade;
and give his arm redouble sway.

for, in a stream so wondrous clear,
when angry Cupid search round,
will not the radiant point appear?
will not the furtive spoil be find?

too soon they be; and every dart,
dip in the muse mystic spring,
acquire new force to wound the heart;
and teach at once to love and sing. 

then farewell you pierian choir;
for who will now your altar throng?
from love we learn to swell the lyre;
and echo ask no sweet song.
