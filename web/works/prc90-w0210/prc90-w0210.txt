A YOUNG LASS's SOLILOQUY

An' so it seems it is reported,
 That I hae ne'er been woo'd nor courted,
 But de'il speed lies;
 The bonny lads came flocking round me,
 Enough in conscience to confound me,
 Like hives of bees. 

But I was cald as winter snaw,
 An' nae return would ever shaw
 For a' their favours;
 An' now ye see ye hae been wrang,
 Nae mair o' me ye'll make a sang,
 But had ye'r clavers. 

Yet out o' spite I'll tell the rest,
 An' which o' them I liked best,
 Wha was sae clever,
 To melt this icy breast o' mine,
 To take my heart without design,
 An' keep it ever. 

It was a lad wi' yellow hair,
 Wi' rosy cheeks, an' forehead fair,
 An' light blue een;
 The like o' him on hill or dale,
 In borough's town, or country vale,
 Was never seen. 

O vow but he was proud an' saucy,
 An' better loo'd anither lassy,
 Wha had some siller;
 But I hae five an five good nails,
 An', ere my strength or courage fails,
 I'll wi' them till her.
