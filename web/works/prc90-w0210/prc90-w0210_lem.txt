a young lass soliloquy

and so it seem it be report,
 that i have never be woo nor court,
 but de'il speed lie;
 the bonny lad come flock round i,
 enough in conscience to confound i,
 like hive of bee. 

but i be call as winter snow,
 and no return will ever sure
 for all their favour;
 and now you see you have be wrang,
 no more of i you will make a sing,
 but have you be claver. 

yet out of spite i will tell the rest,
 and which of they i like best,
 who be so clever,
 to melt this icy breast of i,
 to take my heart without design,
 and keep it ever. 

it be a lad with yellow hair,
 with rosy cheek, and forehead fair,
 and light blue een;
 the like of he on hill or dale,
 in borough town, or country vale,
 be never see. 

o vow but he be proud and saucy,
 and better looe anoth lassy,
 who have some silver;
 but i have five and five good nail,
 and, ere my strength or courage fail,
 i will with they till she.
