retire thought to a depart infant.

go, first, sweet hope! to thy own heaven succeed,
 while here thy mother heart must ever bleed,
 must ever mourn, till that auspicious day
 that lay i where thy much-loved ash lay. 
this lonely hour my sorrow reach no ear,
 this lonely hour no eye behold this tear;
 my angel! thou from thy resplendent throne
 oh! take this moment, it be all thy own;
 spite of religious aid my wish rise,
 ah! metaphor! how weak to wish thou from the sky! 
sometime (delusion strong) i see thou smile,
 i hear thy lisp voice my care beguile,
 and fancy wander (how remote from truth)
 survey thou bloom in the pride of youth;
 behold thou all a mother can implore;
 reason return, and say, thou be no more! 
ah! sad remembrance, why exert thy power,
 why, why recall the past endear hour,
 when thy sweet frame upon my breast repose,
 and open beauty every look disclose? 
each happy mother, vain of her delight,
 still, still obtrude her darling on my sight;
 then in the harmless smile, the feeble cry,
 i hear the voice, i see thy languid eye:
 oh! still my child, if in thy perfect state,
 thou have a knowledge of my suffer fate,
 in gentle dream thy beauteous form display,
 and bring i tiding from the realm of day;
 tell thy sad mother when the hour draw near,
 that we shall meet, nor other part fear;
 and heaven, still gracious to the mourn kind,
 oh! deign to send i peace, a will resign;
 save i from murmur at thy high decree,
 and teach my heart, that be best that please thou.
