An ODE, presented to their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of WALES, in Richmond Gardens, on Thursday, May 6. 1736.

YE Muses, hail the Royal Dame,
 Whose Charms Report excel;
 Charms! brighter far than sounding Fame,
 With all her Tongues, could tell. 

O glorious PRINCE! Britannia's Pride,
 Welcome to Richmond Seats,
 Where Nature, proud to please your BRIDE,
 Displays her choicest Sweets. 

See! fragrant Beauties deck the Green,
 The Branches bloom Delight;
 Gay FLORA paints the verdant Scene,
 To charm your CONSORT's Sight. 

Hear! how the feather'd warbling Throng
 Congratulate your FAIR! 
Not more melodious was their Song
 To the first wedded Pair. 

That Pair, in Eden, ne'er repos'd,
 Where Groves more lovely grew;
 Those Groves, in Eden, ne'er inclos'd
 A lovelier PAIR, than YOU. 

YOU! happier than the former Two,
 Have nobler Tasks assign'd:
 'Twas Theirs to curse the World; but YOU
 Were born to bless Mankind.
