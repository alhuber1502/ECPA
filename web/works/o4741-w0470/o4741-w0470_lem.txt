a ode, present to their royal highness the prince and princess of Wales, in Richmond garden, on Thursday, may 6. 1736. 

you muse, hail the royal dame,
 who charm report excel;
 charm! bright far than sound fame,
 with all her tongue, can tell. 

o glorious prince! britannia pride,
 welcome to Richmond seat,
 where nature, proud to please your bride,
 display her choice sweet. 

see! fragrant beauty deck the green,
 the branch bloom delight;
 gay Flora paint the verdant scene,
 to charm your consort sight. 

hear! how the feather warble throng
 congratulate your fair! 
not more melodious be their song
 to the first wed pair. 

that pair, in Eden, never repose,
 where groves more lovely grow;
 those groves, in Eden, never enclose
 a lovely pair, than you. 

you! happy than the former two,
 have noble task assign:
 it be they to curse the world; but you
 be bear to bless mankind.
