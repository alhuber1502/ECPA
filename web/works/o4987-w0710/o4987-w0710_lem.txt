ode to the HON. JOHN YORK.

imitate from Horace, book ii. ode xvi.

by the same.

for quiet, on Newmarket plain,
 the shiver curate pray in vain,
 when wintery shower be fall,
 and stumble steed, and whistle wind,
 quite banish from his anxious mind
 the duty of his call. 

with thought engross by rout and play,
 the gallant soph for quiet pray,
 confute and confute;
 and quiet be alike desire
 even by the king professor, tire
 with wrangle and dispute. 

in crowd senate, on the chair
 of our vice-chancellor sit care,
 undaunted by the mace;
 care climb the yatcht, when adverse gale
 detain or tear our patron sail,
 and ruffle even his grace. 

how bless be he who annual toil
 with well-ranged tree improve a soil
 for age yet unborn! 
such as at humble barley, plan
 by mitred herring youthful hand,
 the culture glebe adorn. 

from place to place we still pursue
 content, and hope in each to view
 the visionary guest;
 vain we fly intrude care,
 not all, like you, the joy can share
 of wimple and of wrest. 

then let we snatch, while in our power,
 the present transitory hour,
 and leave to heaven the morrow;
 youth have its grief; a friend may die,
 or nymph deceive; for none can fly
 the giant hand of sorrow. 

his country hope, and parent pride,
 in bloom of life young Blandford die:
 he godlike father eye
 be dim with age and helpless tear;
 and heaven to i may grant the year
 which it to you deny. 

your rise virtue soon will claim
 a portion of your brother fame;
 and catch congenial fire;
 they shine in embassy and war,
 they grace the senate and the bar,
 and emulate their sire. 

invest with the sacred gown,
 you soon, to rival their renown,
 the glorious task shall join;
 and while they guard britannia law,
 you, steady to religion cause,
 shall guard the law divine.
