to mr. window, (now fellow) of corpus-christi, Oxford; in answer to a latin epistle, which he send i.

i 

soon as your partial lay i see,
 i guess your crafty view;
 and think you write in verse, to draw
 a bill upon my muse. 

ii.

but, since the treasure you convey,
 come from the roman i;
 forgive i, if i can repay
 the value of your coin. 

iii.

while on thy manly line i dwell,
 line, that may pope employ;
 what strange vicissitude i feel
 of sorrow, love, and joy! 

iv.

now pleasure charm my glow soul,
 to hear thy pompous song
 in soft, majestic number roll,
 like Flaccus, sweet and strong. 

v. 

but quick sympathize pain
 succeed my short delight,
 to find thy move, mournful strain
 describe thy loss of sight. 

vi.

i grieve to think, machaon art
 can give thou no relief;
 i weep, and wish my grateful heart
 can cure, or share, thy grief. 

vii.

no more to i encomium send,
 in such a learned strain;
 but, if you will compliment your friend,
 present he half your pain. 

viii.

to Phoebus make thy music soar,
 to he direct thy lay;
 invoke his aid, and heal power,
 to purge the visual ray. 

ix.

for, if your lyre but strike his ear,
 (the lyre you late string)
 the god of verse and light must hear
 a suit so sweet sing.
