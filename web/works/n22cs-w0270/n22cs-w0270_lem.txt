sonnet [27] xxvii.

sigh i see you little troop at play;
 by sorrow yet untouched; unhurt by care;
 while free and sportive they enjoy today,
 'content and careless of tomorrow fare!'
o happy age! when hope be unclouded ray
 light their green path, and prompt their simple mirth,
 ere yet they feel the thorn that lurk lay
 to wound the wretched pilgrim of the earth,
 make they rue the hour that give they birth,
 and throw they on a world so full of pain,
 where prosperous folly tread on patient worth,
 and to deaf pride, misfortune plead in vain! 
ah! — for their future fate how many fear
 oppress my heart — and fill my eye with tear!
