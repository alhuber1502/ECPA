SONG V.

Praise for Birth and Education in a Christian Land.

I.

GREAT GOD, to thee my Voice I raise,
 To thee my youngest Hours belong;
 I would begin my Life with Praise,
 Till growing Years improve the Song. 

II.

'Tis to thy sov'reign Grace I owe
 That I was born on British Ground;
 Where Streams of heav'nly Mercy flow,
 And Words of sweet Salvation sound. 

III.

I would not change my native Land
 For rich Peru with all her Gold:
 A nobler Prize lies in my Hand,
 Than East or Western Indies hold. 

IV.

How do I pity those that dwell
 Where Ignorance and Darkness reigns! 
They know no Heav'n, they fear no Hell,
 Those endless Joys, those endless Pains. 

V.

Thy glorious Promises, O LORD,
 Kindle my Hopes and my Desire;
 While all the Preachers of thy Word
 Warn me to 'scape eternal Fire. 

VI.

Thy Praise shall still employ my Breath,
 Since thou hast mark'd my Way to Heav'n;
 Nor will I run the Road to Death,
 And waste the Blessings thou hast giv'n.
