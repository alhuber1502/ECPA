the virgin midnight hymn,

suppose to be sing by a chorus of nun at BRUSSELS, in the year 1786, when the author be there. inscribe to the HON. miss molesworths, daughter of lord Molesworth, and to miss horn, daughter of the bishop of Norwich.

to thou, thou great almighty power,
 at this most dread, most solemn hour,
 we virgin join in choral lay;
 do thou inspire our note of praise;
 and as to thou our strain ascend,
 may heaven bright choir attention lend! 
in pity bid our passion cease,
 and bless we with thy holy peace;
 all worldly pomp may we despise,
 and fit, o fit we for the sky. 
for jesus sake our crime forgive,
 and O! when here we cease to live,
 may angel pure our spirit bear,
 eternal joy with thou to share;
 then may we join the choir above,
 and ever sing thy boundless love.
