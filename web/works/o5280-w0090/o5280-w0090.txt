THE VIRGIN'S MIDNIGHT HYMN,

SUPPOSED TO BE SUNG BY A CHORUS OF NUNS AT BRUSSELS, IN THE YEAR 1786, WHEN THE AUTHOR WAS THERE. INSCRIBED TO THE HON. MISS MOLESWORTHS, DAUGHTERS OF LORD MOLESWORTH, AND TO MISS HORNES, DAUGHTERS OF THE BISHOP OF NORWICH.

TO thee, thou great Almighty pow'r,
 At this most dread, most solemn hour,
 We virgins join in choral lays;
 Do thou inspire our notes of praise;
 And as to thee our strains ascend,
 May Heaven's bright choir attention lend! 
In pity bid our passions cease,
 And bless us with thy holy peace;
 All worldly pomps may we despise,
 And fit, O fit us for the skies. 
For Jesu's sake our crimes forgive,
 And O! when here we cease to live,
 May Angels pure our spirits bear,
 Eternal joys with thee to share;
 Then may we join the choir above,
 And ever sing thy boundless love.
