epitaph

on brigadier general hill.

of manner gentle, yet a friend to truth,
 with age not peevish, nor yet vain in youth:
 brave, yet humane, and blameless though severe;
 his speech be open, and his heart sincere:
 in court unbribed, not factious though retire;
 most love the soldier, more the man admire. 
a queen his mistress,. and his friend, mankind;
 his fortune! — to yond little spot confine. 
such once be hill — and various though his lot,
 the same companion, favour, or forget.
