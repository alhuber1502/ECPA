the power of love.

to ROBERT Berkeley, ESQ. Junior, of Spetchley park, Worcestershire.

although the muse in every age
 with Cupid wreath have deck her page,
 and, tutor by the wily boy,
 have tune her lyre to theme of joy. 
yet history, sweet record maid,
 by truth allure, forsake the shade;
 and as down the stream of time
 she steer her course with port sublime,
 she pause point to many a grave,
 where, love, thy willow weep and wave,
 through sad Voclusa pensive stray,
 and nature tender tribute pay.
