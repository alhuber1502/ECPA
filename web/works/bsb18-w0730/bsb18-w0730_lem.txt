o Jenny dear, the word be gane.

o Jenny dear, the word be gane,
 that you be uncommon saucy,
 and that you think this race of man
 deserve not such a lassie. 
troth! gin you wait till man be make
 of something like perfection,
 i fear you will wait till it be say —
 you be late for your election. 

the man agree to give you choice, —
 what think you of young harry? 
 "he never shall have my hand or voice
 who will have a monkey marry? 
he play his prank, he curl his hair,
 and act by imitation;
 a dawt monkey do no more
 than ape the trick of fashion. 

now Sandy he affect the bear,
 and growl at all that be please;
 gin you have a soft or jaunty air,
 that air provoke his tease:
 gin you be cheerful, blithe, and free,
 of that be unbecoming, —
 can never the heartsome temper be
 of any modest woman. 

then Colin, too, although polite,
 have no small share of learning,
 yet stretch out his word so tight,
 they be sad spoil with darning. 
he con his speech, he mend his phrase,
 for fear he speak not grammar;
 when do, you will think that all his day
 he will only learn to hammer. 

now jockey he have wit at will,
 he sing, he play, he dance,
 he be aye so blithe, he be certain still
 to hit the young ane's fancy;
 his word they flow with graceful ease,
 they speak a heart may tender;
 yet underneath these word that please
 there lurk a sad offender. 

not all the wealth of rich Peru
 can keep poor James from fret;
 the gentle gale that ever blow
 his peace will have overset in. 
what can i do, gin apes below
 to lead shall be my station, —
 although ilk ape shall prove some beau
 once famous in this nation? "
