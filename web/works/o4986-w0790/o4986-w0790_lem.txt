epitaph on a schoolfellow.

by the same.

love bank, for thou i heave the frequent sigh,
 for thou the solemn tear bedew my eye;
 no more thy converse blythe shall cheer my day,
 or chase the gloom of anxious thought away. 

and be thou, dear associate! be thou go? 
long must thy friend his sudden loss bemoan;
 over the cold turf where thy pale relique sleep,
 shall fond remembrance oft repair to weep.
