go, Thames, and tell the busy town,
not all its wealth or pride
can tempt i from the charm that crown
that rural flowery side:

ii.

thy flowery side, where pope have place
the muses green retreat,
with every smile of nature grace,
with every art complete.

iii.

but now, sweet bard, thy heavenly song
enchant we here no more;
their darling glory lose too long
thy once love shade deplore.

iv.

yet still for beauteous G—lle's sake,
the muse here remain;
G—lle, who eye have power to make
a pope of every swain.
