farewell stanza on leave Cookham, in the spring of the year, 1781,

when mr. B.  be not quite eighteen year old, two year after he leave eton-school.

to mrs. Malthus.

you nymph and swain, so innocent gay,
 who dwell where Thames roll on his silver way;
 wherever in cookham love retreat you stray,
 to you a wanderer give his part lie;
 nor will he ever forget those blissful day,
 where on your bank he tune his artless lay;
 to you his muse this part tribute pay,
 and sing, but sing unbribed, your modest praise. 
but now a long farewell, you nymph, you swain;
 with you no more i tread the verdant plain,
 no more with you i share my joy, my pain,
 nor shall you hear again my plaintive strain:
 but ere, love Thames, thy flowery bank i leave,
 where oft i have hail the approach of sober eve,
 do thou, while fate permit a short reprieve,
 do thou, dear Thames, this part wish receive;
 "O! ever gentle flow, thou hallow stream! 
O! may thy wave be still the muse theme! 
when on thy bank pale Cynthia shed her beam,
" O! there may fancy gild the poet dream!
