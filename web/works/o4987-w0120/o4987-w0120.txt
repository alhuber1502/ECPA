SONNET.

TO W. HEBERDEN, M. D.

BY THE SAME.

OHEBERDEN, whose salutary care
 Has kindly driven me forth the crowded Town
 To Turrick, and the lonely Country down,
 To breathe from Chiltern Hills a purer air. 

For thousand's sakes may Heaven indulgent spare
 Long, long thy useful life, and blessings crown
 Thy healing arts, while well-deserv'd renown,
 With wealth unenvied, waits thy toil and care:

And when this grateful heart shall beat no more,
 (Nor long, I ween, can last my tottering frame,
 But soon, with me, this mortal coil shall end)
 Do thou, if Calumny again should roar,
 Cherish his memory, and protect his fame,
 Whom thy true worth has made thy faithful friend.
