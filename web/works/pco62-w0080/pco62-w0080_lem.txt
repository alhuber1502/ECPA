a elegy, on the much lament death of Norton powlett ESQ;

who depart this life at Petersfield June the 4th 1741. 

from scene of woe and dismal shade of grief,
 the pensive muse at length attempt relief;
 from sorrow boundless abyss will arise
 to follow noble powlett to the sky,
 do not the cry of those he leave behind,
 to mournful accent her sad thought confine;
 to all both rich and poor his worth be know,
 who heavy heart the public loss bemoan,
 and cry, the good, the generous powlett go! 
who while he live employ his bounteous store
 to serve his country and relieve the poor:
 he noble soul design for liberty,
 scorn with time serve wretch to comply;
 he thirty year together brave stand
 support justice and his country be good. 
this glorious truth let Petersfield proclaim,
 when he to be elect Burgess come,
 but noble lose what other get with shame:
 in great design his useful life do end;
 while here we mourn the patriot and the friend;
 who liberal hand supply the poor with bread,
 widow and orphan on his bounty feed. 
no funeral pompt he need his fame to raise,
 nor mourn elegy to speak his praise;
 nor lofty monument nor flatter art,
 his memory live in every honest heart,
 although his body in the tomb must lie,
 yet powlett honour name shall never die,
 but live with fame to late posterity:
 while man of virtue here his death deplore,
 his soul triumph on the heavenly shore,
 where radiant seraphim their voice strain,
 to celebrate with joy his glorious reign;
 where he, in consort, shall for ever sing,
 loud hallelujah to their heavenly king;
 forever fix in blissful realm of light,
 beyond the reach of perjure villain spite:
 then let we cease our tear and brave try
 once more to gain our ancient liberty;
 remember still that noble powlett strife
 to save our freedom end with his life.
