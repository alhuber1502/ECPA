A Letter written for my Son to a young Gentleman, who was sent to be educated at the Jesuits College in Flanders.

Dear Jack, whilst you thro' Flanders roam,
 Can you forget your Friends at Home? 
Say, will your Tutors give you Time
 To write to Hereticks in Rhyme? 
A Name they brand us with, dear Youth,
 And we affirm they injure Truth. 
The sacred Page before us lies,
 Which you lock up from vulgar Eyes. 
In vain to Men a Light is giv'n,
 To point them out the Path to Heav'n;
 If, lest their Sight should make them stray,
 Their Guides alone must see the Way. 

I fancy now you answer thus:
 Lord! what's Divinity to us? 
This serious Subject is unfit. 
To exercise a School-boy's Wit;
 Then talk of other Matters, Con. 
Inform me how your Class goes on:
 Are you, poor Boys! at School To-day,
 Whilst others are allow'd to play? 

Dear Jack, that is our Case, 'tls true;
 We envy them, and envy you;
 You, who may ramble from your Book,
 To view the Towns Eugenio took;
 Ev'n now, perhaps, attend the Story,
 How Marlbro' won immortal Glory;
 Whilst he, who tells the wondrous Tale,
 At ev'ry Period turning pale,
 Still fancies Vengeance o'er his Head,
 And asks you â€” Are you sure He's dead? 

P.S. 

I just heard happy News, dear Boy;
 And Friendship bids me share the Joy:
 Hibernia has not pray'd in vain;
 Cyrus will visit her again;
 Cyrus, long train'd in Wisdom's School,
 And by Mandana form'd for Rule. 
Ramsay, we find from whence you drew
 Those Characters admir'd in you:
 We Cassendana's Virtues trace,
 And lovely Form in Weymouth's Race. 

O would Mandana cross the Seas,
 And hear a People speak her Praise,
 With Britain vie to hail the Dame,
 Who, Granville, could exalt thy Name,
 Transmitting down thy Fame with Care,
 And double Lustre, in her Heir!
