prologue to bond without judgement, or the love of Bengal.

speak by mr. Holman.

with shaft satyric shoot from phoebus bow
 against wisdom foe to aim the unerring blow,
 to check the rise folly of the age,
 may well be deem the province of the stage. 
here, while their gentle breast indignant burn,
 here fashion offspring may some moral learn. 
this night on india shore our scene we lie,
 though not for want of game so far we stray. 
when here in vain on beaux our beauty smile,
 enrage they vow to quit the tasteless isle,
 and, though against venal love they loud rail,
 yet, blush, for the land of husband sail,
 while neptune self indignant bear the weight,
 and with reluctance waft the unworthy freight. 
when india guilty shore these damsel reach,
 unnumbered nabob throng the golden beach,
 who, while their feeble frame scarce stand the gale,
 explore the beauty of each live bale. 
to you, you fair, belong the important cause,
 it be you must vindicate bless Hymen law;
 for, if from the east this fashion we import,
 and arcot custom lead the british court,
 to Flutus soon your ancient sway must yield,
 and vanquish love shall quit fair albion field. 
be this the case, shall some rich heiress start,
 who countless thousand charm each throb heart,
 the fond enrapture youth who wish to win she
 must even go flirt with Christie or with Skinner. 
the peer, by adverse dice compel to wed,
 from way and mean to Hymen altar lead,
 may ask his friend, "pray where buy you your rib?" 
while he reply, "why, faith, i deal with squib;
 and, as your courtship i be somewhat slow in,
 i get she at the hammer â€”" just a go. " 
on you, you fair, who haply scorn the plan,
 to seek so far that faithless creature, man,
 who, spurn Plutus and his sordid art,
 for love alone exchange the generous heart,
 on your support our anxious bard rely,
 and hope to take his plaudit from your eye;
 for, if your critic frown do not confound he,
 he smile at all the nabob that surround he.
