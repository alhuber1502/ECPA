on my leave London, June the 29. 

what cross impetuous planet govern i,
 that i be thus hurry on to misery;
 i think i have be bless, a while ago,
 but one quick push, plunge i all over in woe. 
my cruel fate, do act the tyrant part,
 and do torment i, with a linger smart;
 to make i sensible of great pain,
 let i take breath, then screw the rack again:
 ah! where be the joy, of such precarious bliss,
 that for one smile short parenthesis;
 i must such tedious horrid pang endure,
 and neither state, will either kill or cure. 
with all submission, i my fate implore,
 destroy i quite, or else torment no more;
 at least let not one glimpse of joy appear,
 it only make my suffering more severe. 
no, here i will rule, not sue to you for this,
 you can tantalise i now with bliss;
 for when you take, my father love away,
 perverse as you, i will not let other stay:
 i be not so insensible undo,
 to hoard up counter, when my gold be go. 
plunder of all, i now forsake the place,
 where all my joy, and all my treasure be,
 ah do not now, my wander footstep trace;
 i leave the town, and all divertisement,
 and in a lonely village be content. 
nor do i ask to be remove from hence,
 though man and beast, be both of equal sense:
 i have not flee, but strong force by you,
 in have bid mother, sister sad adieu. 
i see they last of all i know in town,
 yet all alike to i be stranger grow;
 i almost have forget i ever be there,
 and the sad accident that bring i here. 
ah fate! pursue i not in this retreat,
 let i be quiet in this humble seat:
 let not my friend know where to send to i,
 lest i grow please with their civility. 
i will fain live unconcerned, not please nor cross,
 and be to all the busy world as lose.
