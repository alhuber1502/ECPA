song ii.

if ever thou do joy to bind
 two heart in equal passion join,
 o son of Venus! hear i now,
 and bid florella bless my vow. 

if any bliss reserve for i
 thou in the leaf of fate shall see;
 if any white propitious hour,
 pregnant with hoard joy in store;

now, now the mighty treasure give,
 in she for who alone i live:
 in sterling love pay all the sum,
 and i will absolve the fate to come. 

in all the pride of full-blown charm
 yield she, relent, to my arm:
 her bosom touch with soft desire,
 and let she feel what she inspire. 

but, Cupid, if thy aid be vain
 the dear reluctant maid to gain;
 if still with cold avert eye
 she dash my hope, and scorn my sigh;

o! grant (it be all i ask of thou)
 that i no more may change than she;
 but still with duteous zeal love on,
 when every gleam of hope be go. 

leave i then alone to languish;
 think not time can heal my anguish;
 pity the woe which i endure;
 but never, never grant a cure.
