a very gallant copy of verse, (but somewhat silly) upon the lady, and their fine clothes at a ball.

by mr. W. Taylor.

happy the worm, that spin their life away,
the enrich the splendour of this glorious day!
well please these generous foreigner expire,
a sacrifice to beauty general fire.

oh! have they see, with what superior grace
beauty here triumph in each lovely face,
their amorous flame have their own work betray,
and burn the web their curious art have make!
