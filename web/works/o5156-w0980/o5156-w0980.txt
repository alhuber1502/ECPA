A very gallant Copy of VERSES, (but somewhat silly) upon the Ladies, and their fine Cloaths at a Ball.

By Mr. W. TAYLOR.

HAPPY the worms, that spun their lives away,
T' enrich the splendour of this glorious day!
Well pleas'd these gen'rous foreigners expire,
A sacrifice to Beauty's general fire.

Oh! had they seen, with what superior grace
Beauty here triumphs in each lovely face,
Their am'rous flames had their own work betray'd,
And burn'd the web their curious art had made!
