a new simile, in the manner of swift.

i long have rack my brain to find
 a likeness to the scribble kind;
 the modern scribble kind, who write,
 in wit, and sense, and nature spite;
 till read, i forget what day on,
 a chapter out of take we Pantheon;
 i think with something i meet there,
 to suit my purpose to a hair;
 but let we not proceed too furious,
 first please to turn to god Mercurius;
 you will find he picture at full length
 in book the second, page the tenth:
 the stress of all my proof on he i lie
 and now proceed we to our simile. 

imprimes, pray observe his hat;
 wing upon either side — mark that! 
well! what be it from thence we gather? 
why these denote a brain of a feather. 
a brain of feather! very right,
 with wit that be flighty, learn light;
 such as to modern bard decree;
 a just comparison — proceed. 

in the next place, his foot peruse,
 wing grow again from both his shoe
 design no doubt, their part to bear,
 and waft his godship through the air;
 and here my simile unite,
 for in a modern poet flight,
 i be sure it may be just say,
 his foot be useful as his head. 

last vouchsafe to observe his hand,
 fill with a snake-incircled wand;
 by classic author term caducis,
 and high fame for several use. 
to wit — most wondrous endue,
 no poppy-water half so good;
 for let folk only get a touch,
 its soporific virtue such,
 though never so much awake before,
 that quick they begin to snore. 
add too, what certain writer tell,
 with this he drive man soul to hell. 

now to apply, begin we then;
 his wand a modern author pen;
 the serpent round about it twine,
 denote he of the reptile kind;
 denote the rage with which he write,
 his frothy slaver, venom bite;
 a equal semblance still to keep,
 alike they both conduce to sleep. 
this difference only, as the god,
 drive soul to tart'rus with his rod;
 with his goose-quill the scribble elf,
 instead of other, damn himself. 

and here my simile almost trip,
 yet grant a word by way of postscript,
 moreover, mercury have a fail:
 well! what of that? out with it — steal:
 in which our scribble bard agree,
 be each as great thief as he;
 but even his deities existence
 shall lend my simile assistance. 
our modern bard! why what a pox
 be they but senseless stone and block?
