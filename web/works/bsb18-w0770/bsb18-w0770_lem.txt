i be of a temper fix as a decree.

i be of a temper fix as a decree,
 resolve with myself to live happy and free;
 with the care of this world i be seldom perplex,
 i be sometime uneasy, but never quite vex;
 i be neither too high nor too low in degree;
 there be more that live worse than live better than i. 

my life thus move on amid freedom and ease,
 i go where i will, and i come when i please;
 i be place below envy, and yet above spite;
 i have judgement enough still to do myself right:
 some high, some low, i own there may be,
 but ambition and want be both stranger to i. 

when money come in, please i live till it be go,
 i be happy when with it, content with none;
 if i spend it among friend i count it but lent,
 it thus go genteel â€” i never repent;
 with mirth to my labour the hour sweet pass,
 though at Saturday night i be just where i be.
