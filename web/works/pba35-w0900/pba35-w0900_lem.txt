to the right honourable the earl of thomond, at bath; who charge the author with make a irish bull.

obrian, we be in story tell,
 thy ancestor wear crown of old:
 in fair hibernia isle they reign;
 a country, by their son disdain! 
too apt to charge their native isle
 with every vice of speech and style:
 yet thy Eliza, great and good,
 of seymour, and of piercy blood,
 (who ancestor, to fame well know,
 when injure, shake the british throne;)
 will not thy native isle deride,
 though to a high crown ally. 
and shall Hibernia fear disgrace,
 from thomond, of milesian race? 
it ill become thou thus to treat
 thy family imperial seat. 

great Boiroimke! look down and see
 this change in thy posterity;
 who quit all title to thy throne,
 but hospitality alone.
