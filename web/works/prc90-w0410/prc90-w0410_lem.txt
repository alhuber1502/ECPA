on a young lady, who ask a necklace of a gentleman hair, and be refuse

and be it thus, Miranda cry,
 and be i then by he deny,
 alas my heart be sore;
 why do i make the fond request? 
why not conceal it in my breast,
 as i have do before? 

i know not how he speak so fair,
 i wish to have his yellow hair,
 and wear it round my neck;
 but, o! it hurt his gentle mind,
 such boldness in my sex to find,
 then what can i expect.
