ON A YOUNG LADY, WHO ASKED A NECKLACE OF A GENTLEMAN's HAIR, AND WAS REFUSED

And is it thus, Miranda cried,
 And am I then by him denied,
 Alas my heart is sore;
 Why did I make the fond request? 
Why not conceal it in my breast,
 As I had done before? 

I know not how he spoke so fair,
 I wish'd to have his yellow hair,
 And wear it round my neck;
 But, O! it hurt his gentle mind,
 Such boldness in my sex to find,
 Then what could I expect.
