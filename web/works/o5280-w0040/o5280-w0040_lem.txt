to miss â€” of Dublin,

on the death of her mother.

embosomed in the bloom-bespangled thorn,
 the lonely minstrel wake her strain forlorn,
 and to the ear of night unfold her tale,
 of ceaseless sorrow, and of widow wail:
 thus, bend beneath a more than common woe,
 at memory shrine thy tear incessant flow. 
yet why, ah, why, with cheerless gloom overcast,
 still ponder over the irrevocable past? 
why, weep, bend over virtue hallow tomb,
 whence hope, immortal hope, dispel the gloom? 
to her mild sway thy torture breast resign,
 and make, dear maid, her balmy pleasure thy.
