Verses addressed to H.S.H. the Margravine on the appointment of milk-woman to the Pope.

I.

His Holiness deranged and ill
 Was often heard to mutter
 Throw to the dogs your nasty pill
 I only long for butter. 

II.

St. Dominic said in a dream
 Leo away with plaisters
 And trust to butter and to cream
 For curing your disasters. 

III.

Each doctor long his art had tried
 To drive away the spleen
 Whoever spoke â€” the Pope replied
 "Butter and Margravine." 

IV.

'Tis now resolved to wait no more
 "Her butter to my knowledge"
 The Pontiff cried, "is worth a score
 Such quacks and all the College." 

V.

 "We Popes are not so easily turn'd
 I'll search the country round"
 And at the Strozzi newly churn'd
 The melting pot was found. 

VI.

George our King may freely call
 His Flower Girl Miss Fellowes
 The Margravine's a name they all
 May hear of and be jealous. 

VII.

For now the dames may on their knees
 Knock under as I hope
 They'll not dispute the pas while she's
 Milkwoman to the Pope. 

VIII.

Thus in sweet sympathy of state
 Six kingdoms ruled shall be
 The Pope rules heaven and earth and fate
 Milk, cheese, and butter she.
