 Leo away with plaster
 and trust to butter and to cream

iii.

each doctor long his art have try
 to drive away the spleen
 whoever speak â€” the pope reply
 "butter and margravine." 

iv.

it be now resolve to wait no more
 "her butter to my knowledge"
 the pontiff cry, "be worth a score
 such quack and all the college." 

v. 

 "we pope be not so easy turn
 i will search the country round"
 and at the Strozzi new churn
 the melt pot be find. 

vi.

 six kingdom rule shall be
