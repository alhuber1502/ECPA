these plain, so joyous once to i,
 now sad change appear:
 Hortensia i no more can see,
 who patronise i here. 

fair excellence, wherever you go,
 may kindred angel wait,
 to guard you through this vale of woe,
 to your celestial seat. 

sage boerhaave! now exert your art,
 new medicine explore:
 a pure, or a noble heart,
 never seek thy aid before. 

your choice spring, Germania, give:
 goddess of health, attend:
 long, long, and happy may she live,
 the lonely stranger friend.
