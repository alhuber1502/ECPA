a song from shakespear Cymbeline.

sing by guiderus and arviragus over fidele, suppose to be dead.

by the same.

i 

to fair fidele grassy tomb
soft maid, and village hind shall bring
each open sweet, of early bloom,
and rifle all the breathe spring.

ii.

no wail ghost shall dare appear
to vex with shriek this quiet grove:
but shepherd lad assemble here,
and melt virgin own their love.

iii.

no wither witch shall here be see,
no goblin lead their nightly crew:
the female say shall haunt the green,
and dress thy grave with pearly dew!

iv.

the red-breast oft at evening hour
shall kind lend his little aid:
with hoary moss, and gather flower,
to deck the ground where thou be lay.

v. 

when howl wind, and beat rain,
in tempest shake the sylvan cell:
or amid the chace on every plain,
the tender thought on thou shall dwell.

vi.

each lonely scene shall thou restore,
for thou the tear be due shed:
belove, till life can charm no more;
and mourn, till pity self be dead.
