song,

write for a welch melody.

I have no sheep on the mountain, nor boat on the lake,
 nor coin in my coffer to keep i awake,
 nor corn in my garner, nor fruit on my tree,
 yet the maid of Llanwellyn smile sweet on i. 

soft tap at eve o her window i come,
 and loud bay the watch-dog, loud scold the dame;
 for shame, silly lightfoot! what be it to thou,
 though the maid of Llanwellyn smile sweet on i? 

the farmer ride proud to market or fair,
 the clerk at the ale-house still claim the great chair,
 but, of all our proud fellow, the proud i will be,
 while the maid of Llanwellyn smile sweet on i. 

for blythe as the urchin at holiday play,
 and meek as a matron in mantle of grey,
 and trim as a lady of gentle degree,
 be the maid of Llanwellyn, who smile upon i.
