ode on a distant prospect of Eton college

you distant spire, you antique tower,
that crown the watery glade,
where grateful science still adore
her Henry holy shade;
and you, that from the stately brow
of windsor height the expanse below
of grove, of lawn, of mead survey,
who turf, who shade, who flower among
wander the hoary Thames along
his silver-winding way.

ah happy hill, ah please shade,
ah field belove in vain,
where once my careless childhood stray,
a stranger yet to pain!
i feel the gale, that from you blow,
a momentary bliss bestow,
as wave fresh their gladsome wing,
my weary soul they seem to soothe,
and, redolent of joy and youth,
to breathe a second spring.

say, father Thames, for thou have see
full many a sprightly race
disport on thy margin green
the path of pleasure trace,
who foremost now delight to cleave
with pliant arm thy glassy wave?
the captive linnet which enthrall?
what idle progeny succeed
to chase the roll circle speed,
or urge the fly ball?

while some on earnest business bend
their murmur labour ply
against grave hour, that bring constraint
to sweeten liberty:
some bold adventurer disdain
the limit of their little reign,
and unknown region dare descry:
still as they run they look behind,
they hear a voice in every wind,
and snatch a fearful joy.

gay hope be they by fancy feed,
less please when possess;
the tear forget as soon as shed,
the sunshine of the breast:
they buxom health of rosy hue,
wild wit, invention ever-new,
and lively cheer of vigour bear;
the thoughtless day, the easy night,
the spirit pure, the slumber light,
that fly the approach of morn.

alas, regardless of their doom,
the little victim play!
no sense have they of ill to come,
nor care beyond today:
yet see how all around they wait
the minister of human fate,
and black misfortune baleful train!
ah, show they where in ambush stand
to seize their prey the murderous band!
ah, tell they, they be man!

these shall the fury passion tear,
the vulture of the mind,
disdainful anger, pallid fear,
and shame that skulk behind;
or pine love shall waste their youth,
or jealousy with rankle tooth,
that inly gnaw the secret heart,
and envy wan, and fade care,
grim-visaged comfortless despair,
and sorrow pierce dart.

ambition this shall tempt to rise,
then whirl the wretch from high,
to bitter scorn a sacrifice,
and grin infamy.
the sting of falsehood those shall try,
and hard unkindness alter eye,
that mock the tear it force to flow;
and keen remorse with blood defile,
and moody madness laugh wild
amid severe woe.

lo, in the vale of year beneath
a grisly troop be see,
the painful family of death,
more hideous than their queen:
this rack the joint, this fire the vein,
that every labour sinew strain,
those in the deep vital rage:
lo, poverty, to fill the band,
that numb the soul with icy hand,
and slow-consuming age.

to each his suffering: all be man,
condemn alike to groan;
the tender for another pain,
the unfeeling for his own.
yet ah! why shall they know their fate?
since sorrow never come too late,
and happiness too swift fly.
thought will destroy their paradise.
no more; where ignorance be bliss,
it be folly to be wise.
