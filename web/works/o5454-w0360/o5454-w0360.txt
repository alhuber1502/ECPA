[MORAL SONG] III. The ROSE.

I.

HOW fair is the Rose? what a beautiful Flow'r? 
The Glory of April and May:
 But the Leaves are beginning to fade in an Hour,
 And they wither and die in a Day. 

II.

Yet the Rose has one powerful Virtue to boast,
 Above all the Flowers of the Field:
 When its Leaves are all dead, and fine Colours are lost,
 Still how sweet a Perfume it will yield? 

III.

So frail is the Youth and the Beauty of Men,
 Tho' they bloom and look gay like the Rose:
 But all our fond Care to preserve them is vain;
 Time kills them as fast as he goes. 

IV.

Then I'll not be proud of my Youth or my Beauty,
 Since both of them wither and fade:
 But gain a good Name by well-doing my Duty;
 This will scent like a Rose when I'm dead.
