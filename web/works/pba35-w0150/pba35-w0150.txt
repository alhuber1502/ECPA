Occasion'd by seeing some Verses written by Mrs. Constantia Grierson, upon the Death of her Son.

This mourning Mother can with Ease explore
 The Arts of Latium, and the Grecian Store:
 Was early learn'd, nay more, was early wise;
 And knew the Pride of Science to despise;
 Left Men to take assuming Airs from thence;
 And seem'd unconscious of superior Sense. 
Yet, ah! how vain to guard the Soul, we see,
 Are the best Precepts of Philosophy! 
See Nature triumph o'er the boasted Art,
 Ev'n in a Solon's, and Constantia's Heart. 
See how she mourns her Son's untimely Doom,
 And pours her Woes o'er the relentless Tomb. 

Soften, kind Heav'n, her seeming rigid Fate,
 With frequent Visions of his blissful State:
 Oft let the Guardian Angel of her Son
 Tell her in faithful Dreams, His Task is done;
 Shew, how he kindly led her lovely Boy
 To Realms of Peace, and never-fading Joy. 

Then, for a while, reverse his happy Fate;
 Shew him still here, still in this wretched State:
 Shew the false World, seducing him from Truth;
 And paint the slipp'ry, dang'rous Paths of Youth:
 Shew him, in riper Years, beset with Snares,
 Weary'd with struggling thro' unnumber'd Cares:
 Convey him thence to Life's remotest Stage,
 To feel the dire Calamities of Age;
 Oppress'd with Sorrows, with Distempers torn,
 Or rack'd with Guilt, much harder to be borne. 
Raise the Distress; and let her darling Care,
 Distracted in the Horrors of Despair,
 The dreadful Scene of Judgment op'ning see,
 And, trembling, plunge into Eternity. 

Then ask her, Would she call him down from Bliss,
 To hazard such a dismal Doom as this? 
That she may learn to be resign'd from thence,
 And bless the Guardian Hand, that snatch'd him hence.
