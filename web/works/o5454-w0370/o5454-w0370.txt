[MORAL SONG] IV. The THIEF.

I.

WHY should I deprive my Neighbour
 Of his Goods against his Will? 
Hands were made for honest Labour,
 Not to plunder or to steal. 

II.

'Tis a foolish Self-deceiving
 By such Tricks to hope for Gain:
 All that's ever got by Thieving
 Turns to Sorrow, Shame, and Pain. 

III.

Have not Eve and Adam taught us
 Their sad Profit to compute? 
To what dismal State they brought us
 When they stole forbidden Fruit? 

IV.

Oft we see a young Beginner
 Practise little pilf'ring Ways,
 Till grown up a harden'd Sinner;
 Then the Gallows ends his Days. 

V.

Theft will not be always hidden,
 Tho' we fancy none can spy:
 When we take a Thing forbidden,
 GOD beholds it with his Eye. 

VI.

Guard my Heart, O GOD of Heav'n,
 Lest I covet what's not mine:
 Lest I steal what is not giv'n,
 Guard my Heart and Hands from Sin.
