desire to praise worthy.

from the german. 

i 

monarch of all, with lowly fear
 to who heaven host their voice raise,
 even earth and dust thy bounty share:
 let earth and dust attempt thy praise. 

ii.

before thy face, o lord most high,
 sink all create glory down:
 yet be not wroth with i, that i
 vile worm, draw near thy awful throne. 

iii.

of all thou the begin art,
 of all thing thou alone the end:
 on thou still fix my steadfast heart;
 to thou let all my action tend. 

iv.

thou, lord, be light: thy native ray
 no shade, no variation know â€”
 on my dark soul (you cloud away)
 the brightness of thy face disclose. 

v. 

thou, lord, art love: from thou pure love
 flow forth in unexhausted stream;
 let i its quicken influence prove,
 fill my whole heart with sacred flame. 

vi.

thou, lord, be good, and thou alone:
 with eager hope, with warm desire,
 thou may i still my portion own,
 to thou in every thought aspire. 

vii.

so shall my every power to thou
 in love, thanks, praise incessant rise,
 yea my whole soul and flesh shall be
 one holy, live sacrifice. 

viii.

lord god of army, ceaseless praise
 in heaven thy throne to thou be give,
 here as in heaven thy name we raise,
 for where thy presence shine, be heaven.
