Addressed to My Brother.

1805.

BROTHER beloved! if health shall smile again
 Upon this wasted form and fevered cheek;
 If e'er returning vigour bids these weak
 And languid limbs their gladsome strength regain;
 Well may thy brow the placid glow retain
 Of sweet content, and thy pleased eye may speak
 Thy conscious self-applause: but should I seek
 To utter what this heart can feel, ah! vain
 Were the attempt! Yet, kindest friends, as o'er
 My couch ye bend, and watch with tenderness
 The being whom your cares could e'en restore
 From the cold grasp of death; say, can you guess
 The feelings which this lip can ne'er express? 
Feelings deep fixed in grateful memory's store!
