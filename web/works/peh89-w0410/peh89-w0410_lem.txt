to thirsis, on his signify his intention to lay aside his hautboy. 

what spurious offspring of low-thoughted care
 assume the graceful muse win air,
 and bid my thirsis lie aside his reed,
 that dullness may serenity succeed;
 this step still onward her dark purpose bring,
 for out of dullness, melancholy spring;
 nor here the gloomy phantom end her care,
 for next to melancholy, come despair:
 when faint virtue make her slow retreat,
 vice ready stand, to fill the vacant seat. 
oft have i see the swain assemble round,
 with silent awe, till thirsis lead the sound:
 still, as your breath, the cheer pipe inspire,
 conduct the voice of the hymn choirs:
 if thou, their leader and support shall fail,
 slack negligence will over the rest prevail;
 no more the evening of the holiday,
 shall send to heaven their well-accepted lay;
 but giddy youth to vanity shall run,
 nay, well if dark scene of vice they shun.
