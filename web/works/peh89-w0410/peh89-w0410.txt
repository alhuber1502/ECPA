To THIRSIS, On his signifying his intention to lay aside his Hautboy. 

What spurious offspring of low-thoughted care
 Assumes the graceful muses winning air,
 And bids my Thirsis lay aside his reed,
 That dulness may serenity succeed;
 This step still onward her dark purpose brings,
 For out of dulness, melancholy springs;
 Nor here the gloomy phantom ends her care,
 For next to melancholy, comes despair:
 When fainting virtue makes her slow retreat,
 Vice ready stands, to fill the vacant seat. 
Oft have I seen the swains assembled round,
 With silent awe, till Thirsis led the sound:
 Still, as your breath, the cheering pipe inspires,
 Conduct the voices of the hymning choirs:
 If thou, their leader and support should'st fail,
 Slack negligence will o'er the rest prevail;
 No more the evenings of the holy-days,
 Shall send to Heav'n their well-accepted lays;
 But giddy youths to vanities shall run,
 Nay, well if darker scenes of vice they shun.
