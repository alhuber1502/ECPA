song.

bird soar high, cloud in the sky,
 where go you? o where go you? 
where the smoke from the gipsy fire be veer,
 and our gay little boat, over the blue frith steer,
 will soon bear i. 

my thought before, on yonder shore,
 be free as wind, be free as wind,
 while this body of i on its palfrey ride,
 right lazy of pace, or on smooth wave glide,
 be far behind. 

but see i not, yond distant spot? 
o now i see, o now i see! 
where the mist up the distant hill be creep,
 and wood through the morning cloud be peep,
 there dwell she. 

do gentle deep her sense steep
 or do she wake? or do she wake? 
even now perhaps, her dark hair raise,
 at her casement she stand, over the water she be gaze,
 all for my sake. 

her face be gay as the joyous day,
 and o how sweet! and o how sweet! 
her voice as she utter her modest greeting,
 while my heart at the sound be so quick beat,
 whenever we meet! 

when time run on, and week be go,
 then on that shore, then on that shore,
 i will meet she with all my gay bridesman bound,
 in light-hearted glee to the minstrel sound,
 and part no more.
