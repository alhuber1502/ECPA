lye, philo, untouched on my peaceable shelf;
 nor take it amiss, that so little i heed thou;
 I have no envy to thou, and some love to my self:

drink with helicon water and double-brewed Bub,
 be a linguist, a poet, a critic, a wag;
 to the solid delight of thy well-judging club,
 to the damage alone of thy bookseller brag.

but from all viv√¢ voce reflection forbear:
 there can be no danger from what thou shall print:
 there may be a little from what thou may swear.
