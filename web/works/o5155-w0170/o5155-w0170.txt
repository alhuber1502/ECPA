VERSES to Dr. GEORGE ROGERS,

on his taking the Degree of Doctor in Physic at Padua, in the Year 1664.

By Mr. WALLER.

WHEN as of old the earth's bold children strove,
With hills on hills, to scale the throne of Jove;
Pallas and Mars stood by their sovereign's side,
And their bright arms in his defence employ'd:
While the wife Phoebus, Hermes, and the rest,
Who joy in peace and love the Muses best,
Descending from their so distemper'd seat,
Our groves and meadows chose for their retreat.
There first Apollo tried the various use
Of herbs, and learn'd the virtue of their juice,
And fram'd that art, to which who can pretend
A juster title than our noble friend,
Whom the like tempest drives from his abode,
And like employment entertains abroad?
This crowns him here; and, in the bays so earn'd,
His country's honour is no less concern'd;
Since it appears, not all the English rave,
To ruin bent: some study how to save.
And as Hippocrates did once extend
His sacred art, whole cities to amend;
So we, brave friend, suppose that thy great skill,
Thy gentle mind, and fair example will,
At thy return, reclaim our frantic isle,
Their spirits calm; and peace again shall smile.
