Edwin and Emma.

by the same.

i 

far in the wind of a vale,
 fast by a shelter wood,
 the safe retreat of health and peace,
 a humble cottage stand. 

ii.

there beauteous Emma flourish fair,
 beneath a mother eye;
 who only wish on earth be now
 to see she bless, and die. 

iii.

the soft blush that nature spread
 give colour to her cheek:
 such orient colour smile through heaven,
 when vernal morning break. 

iv.

nor let the pride of great one scorn
 this charmer of the plain:
 that sun, who bid their diamond blaze,
 to paint our lily deign. 

v. 

long have she fill each youth with love,
 each maiden with despair;
 and though by all a wonder own,
 yet know not she be fair. 

vi.

till Edwin come, the pride of swain,
 a soul devoid of art;
 and from who eye, serene mild,
 shine forth the feeling heart,

vii.

a mutual flame be quick catch:
 be quick too reveal:
 for neither bosom lodge a wish,
 that virtue keep conceal. 

viii.

what happy hour of homefelt bliss
 do love on both bestow! 
but bliss too mighty long to last,
 where fortune prove a foe. 

ix.

his sister, who, like envy form,
 like she in mischief joy,
 to work they harm, with wicked skill,
 each dark art employ. 

x. 

the father too, a sordid man,
 who love nor pity know,
 be all-unfeeling as the clod,
 from whence his riches grow. 

xi.

long have he see their secret flame,
 and see it long unmoved:
 then with a father frown at last
 have stern disapprove. 

xii.

in edwin gentle heart, a war
 of differ passion strive:
 he heart, that dare not disobey,
 yet can not cease to love. 

xiii.

deny her sight, he oft behind
 the spread hawthorn creep,
 to snatch a glance, to mark the spot
 where Emma walk and weep. 

xiv.

oft too on stanemore wintery waste,
 beneath the moonlight-shade,
 in sigh to pour his soften soul,
 the midnight-mourner stray. 

XV. 

his cheek, where health with beauty glow,
 a deadly pale overcast:
 so fade the fresh rose in its prime,
 before the northern blast. 

xvi.

the parent now, with late remorse,
 hang over his die bed;
 and weary heaven with fruitless vow,
 and fruitless sorrow shed. 

xvii.

it be past! he cry — but if your soul
 sweet mercy yet can move,
 let these dim eye once more behold,
 what they must ever love! 

xviii.

she come; his cold hand soft touch,
 and bathe with many a tear:
 fast-falling over the primrose pale,
 so morning dew appear. 

xix.

but oh! his sister be jealous care,
 a cruel sister she! 
forbid what Emma come to say;
 "my Edwin live for i."

xx.

now homeward as she hopeless weep
 the church-yard path along,
 the blast blow cold, the dark owl scream
 her lover funeral song. 

xxi.

amid the fall gloom of night,
 her startle fancy find
 in every bush his hover shade,
 his groan in every sound. 

xxii.

alone, appal, thus have she pass
 the visionary vale —
 when lo! the death-bell smite her ear,
 sad-sounding in the gale! 

xxiii.

just then she reach, with tremble step,
 her age mother door —
 he be go! she cry; and i shall see
 that angel-face no more! 

xxiv.

i feel, i feel this break heart
 beat high against my side —
 from her white arm down sink her head;
 she shiver sigh, and die.
