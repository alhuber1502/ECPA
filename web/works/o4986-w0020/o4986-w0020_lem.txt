Hengist and mey:

a ballad.

by the author of the concubine.

in ancient day, when Arthur reign,
 sir Elmer have no peer! 
and no young knight in all the land
 the lady love so dear. 

his sister mey, the fair maid
 of all the virgin train,
 win every heart at Arthur court,
 but all their love be vain. 

in vain they love, in vain they vow,
 her heart they can not move:
 yet at the evening hour of prayer
 her mind be lose in love. 

the abbess see, the abbess know,
 and urge she to explain;
 "o name the gentle youth to i,
" and his consent i will gain. " 

long urge, long vex, fair mey reply,
 "his name how can i say? 
" a angel from the field above
 "have rapt my heart away. 

 "but once, alas, and never more,
" he lovely form i spy,
 "one evening by the sound shore,
" all by the greenwood side:

 "his eye to i the love confess,
" that glow with mild grace:
 "he courtly mien and purple vest
" bespeak his princely race. 

 "but when he hear my brother horn
" fast to his ship he flee:
 "yet while i sleep his graceful form
" still hover round my bed. 

 "sometime all clad in armour bright,
" he shake a warlike lance;
 "and now in courtly garment dight,
" he lead the sprightly dance,

 "his hair be black as raven wing,
" his skin as christmas snow,
 "his cheek outvie the blush of morn,
" his lip like rose-bud glow. 

 "his limb, his arm, his stature, shape
" by nature fine hand;
 "he sparkle eye declare he bear
" to love and to command. " 

the live-long year fair mey bemoan
 her hopeless pine love:
 but when the balmy spring return,
 and summer clothe the grove;

all round by pleasant Humber side
 the saxon banner fly,
 and to sir elmer castle gate
 the spearman come in view. 

fair blush the morn when mey look over
 the castle-wall so sheen;
 and, lo, the warlike saxon youth
 be sport on the green. 

there Hengist, offa old son,
 lean on his burnish lance,
 and all the arm youth around
 obey his manly glance. 

his lock as black as raven wing
 down his shoulder flow,
 his cheek outvy the blush of morn,
 his lip like rose-bud glow,

and soon the lovely form of mey
 have catch his pierce eye:
 he give the sign, his band retire,
 while big with love he sigh,

 "oh thou, for who i dare the sea,
" and come with peace or war;
 "oh, by that cross that veil thy breast,
" relieve thy lover care! 

 "for thou i will quit my father throne,
" with thou the wild explore;
 "or with thou share the british crown,
" with thou the cross adore. " 

beneath the timorous virgin blush,
 with love soft warmth she glow:
 so blush through the dew of morn
 appear the open rose. 

it be now the hour of morning prayer,
 when man their sin bewail,
 that Elmer hear king Arthur horn
 shrill sound through the dale. 

the pearly tear from mey bright eye
 like April dew drop fall,
 when with a part dear embrace
 her brother bid farewell. 

the cross with sparkle diamond bright
 that veil her snowy breast,
 with prayer to heaven, her lily hand
 have fix on elmer vest. 

now with five-hundred bowman true
 he be march across the plain,
 till with his gallant yeomanry
 he join king Arthur train. 

full forty thousand saxon spear
 come glitter down the hill,
 and with their shout and clang of arm
 the distant valley fill. 

old offa, dress in odin garb,
 assume the hoary god;
 and Hengist, like the warlike Thor,
 before the horseman ride. 

with dreadful rage the combat burn,
 the captain shout amain;
 and elmer tall victorious spear
 far glance over the plain. 

to stop its course young Hengist fly
 like lightning over the field;
 and soon his eye the wellknown cross
 on elmer vest behold. 

the slight lover swell his breast,
 his eye shoot live fire,
 and all his martial heat before
 to this be mild desire. 

on his imagine rival steed
 with furious force he press,
 and glance to the sun, his sword
 resound on elmer crest. 

the foe give way, the princely youth
 with heedless rage pursue,
 till tremble in his cleave helm
 sir elmer javelin stand. 

he bow his head, slow drop his spear,
 the reins slip through his hand,
 and stain with blood, his stately corpse
 lay breathless on the strand. 

 "o bear i off," sir Elmer cry,
 "before my painful sight
" the combat swim — yet hengist vest
 "i claim as victor right." 

brave hengist fall the saxon see,
 and all in terror flee. 
the bowman to his castle gate
 the bold sir Elmer lead. 

 "oh wash my wound, my sister dear,
" o pull this saxon dart,
 "that whizz from young hengist arm
" have almost pierce my heart. 

 "yet in my hall his vest shall hang,
" and briton yet unborn
 "shall with the trophy of today
" their solemn feast adorn. 

all-trembling mey behold the vest;
 "oh, Merlin," loud she cry,
 "thy word be true — my slaughter love
" shall have a breathless bride! 

 "oh, Elmer, Elmer, boast no more
" that low my Hengist lie! 
 "o, Hengist, cruel be thy arm;
" my brother bleed and die! " 

she speak — the rose leave her cheek,
 and life warm spirit flee:
 so nip by winter linger blast,
 the snowdrop bow the head. 

yet part life one struggle give,
 she lift her languid eye;
 "return, my Hengist, oh return,
" my slaughter love! "she cry. 

 "oh — still he live — he smile again,
" with all his grace he move:
 "i come — i come, where bow nor spear
" shall more disturb our love.  "—

she speak — she die. the saxon dart
 be draw from elmer side;
 and thrice he call his sister mey,
 and thrice he groan, and die. 

where in the dale a moss-grown cross
 overshade a age thorn,
 sir elmer and young hengist corpse
 be by the spearman bear. 

and there all clad in robe of white,
 with many a sigh and tear,
 the village maid to hengist grave
 do mey fair body bear. 

and there at dawn and fall of day,
 all from the neighbour grove,
 the turtle wail in widow note,
 and sing their hapless love.
