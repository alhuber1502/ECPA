song.

 "toss amid life terrific storm,
" my soul on nature centre cling,
 "strive to taste each scatter bliss,
" and loud grateful anthem sing. 

 "when fly over the billowy deep,
" upborne the sound wave among,
 "while wind the boil ocean sweep,
" and lighten dart their fire along;

 "absorb, unmoved, resolve of mind,
" i dare the element assault,
 "amid roar ocean plough by wind,
" while thunder burst through heaven high vault. 

 "on virtue base, and buoy by hope,
" i see peace beam through every cloud;
 "benumb upon the shatter rope
" still grateful be my song, and loud. 

 "grateful, for be raise from nought
" to scene where nature blessing shine,
 "endue with fancy, love, and think,
" and dawn of a soul divine! "
