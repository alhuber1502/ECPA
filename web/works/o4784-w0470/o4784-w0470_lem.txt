ALCIDOR.

while monarch in stern battle strive
 for proud imperial sway;
 abandon to his mild love,
 within a silent peaceful grove,
 Alcidor careless lay. 

some term it cold, unmanly fear;
 some, nicety of sense,
 that drum and trumpet can not hear,
 the sully blast of powder bear,
 or with foul camp dispense. 

a patient martyr to their scorn,
 and each ill-fashioned jest;
 the youth, who but for love be bear,
 remain, and think it vast return,
 to reign in cloria breast. 

but oh! a ruffle soldier come
 in all the pomp of war:
 the gazette long have speak his fame;
 now hautboy his approach proclaim,
 and draw in croud from far. 

Cloria unhappy will gaze;
 and as he near draw,
 the man of feather and of lace
 stop short, and with profound amaze
 take all her charm to view. 

a bow, which from campaign he bring,
 and to his holster low,
 herself, and the spectator teach,
 that she the fair nymph he think,
 of all that form the row. 

next day, ere Phoebus can be see,
 or any gate unbar;
 at she, upon the adjoin green,
 from rank, with wave flag between,
 be soften trumpet hear. 

the noon do follow treat provide,
 in the pavilion shade;
 the neighbourhood, and all beside,
 that will attend the amorous pride,
 be welcome with the maid. 

poor Alcidor! thy hope be cross,
 go perish on the ground;
 thy sigh by strong note be toss,
 drive back, or in the passage lose;
 rich wine thy tear have drown. 

in woman heart, the soft thing
 which nature can devise,
 be yet some harsh, and jar string,
 that, when loud fame, or profit ring,
 will answer to the noise. 

poor Alcidor! go fight or dye;
 let thy fond notion cease:
 man be not make in shade to lie,
 or his full bliss, at ease, enjoy,
 to live, or love in peace.
