the cave of pope.

a prophecy.

by Râ€” d.

when dark oblivion in her sable cloak
shall wrap the name of hero and of king;
and their high deed submit to the stroke
of time shall fall among forget thing:

then (for the muse that distant day can see)
on thames bank the stranger shall arrive,
with curious wish thy sacred grott to see,
thy sacred grott shall with thy name survive.

grateful posterity, from age to age,
with pious hand the ruin shall repair:
some good old man, to each inquire sage
point the place, shall cry, "the bard live there,

"who song be music to the listen ear,
"yet teach audacious vice and folly, shame:
"easy his manner, but his life severe;
"his word alone give infamy or fame.

"sequester from the fool and coxcomb-wit,
"beneath this silent roof the muse he find;
"it be here he sleep inspire, or sit and write;
"here with his friend the social glass go round. "

with awful veneration shall they trace
the step which thou so long before have tread;
with reverend wonder view the solemn place,
from whence thy genius soar to nature god.

then, some small gem, or moss, or shine over,
depart, each shall pilfer, in fond hope
to please their friend on every distant shore,
boast a relic from the cave of pope.
