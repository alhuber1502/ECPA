a song.

i 

shall pope sing his flame
 with quality dame,
 and duchess toast when he dine;
 shall swift ballad compose
 on the girl at the rose,
 while unsung be my fair Charlotte Lynes? 

ii.

o! be Phoebus my friend,
 or will Bacchus but lend
 i the spirit that flow from his wine,
 the lass of the mill,
 Molly Mogg, and lepell,
 shall be dowdy to fair Charlotte Lynes. 

iii.

the astronomer cry
 look up to yond sky,
 and view the bright heavenly sign;
 for a sight bright far
 than sun, moon, or star,
 let he look at my fair Charlotte Lynes. 

iv.

the miser for gain
 think nothing of pain,
 and content dig in the mine:
 let he take all Peru,
 and rich Mexico too,
 what be these to my fair Charlotte Lynes? 

v. 

any porter may serve
 for a copy to carve
 a alcides with muscular chine;
 but a Venus to draw,
 bright as eye ever see,
 he must copy my fair Charlotte Lynes. 

vi.

the favourite child,
 who her fondness have spoil,
 for mamma often whimper and whine;
 and this hour let i die
 but i languish and sigh,
 when i be absent from fair Charlotte Lynes. 

vii.

for quadrille when the fair
 card and counter prepare,
 they cast out the ten, eight, and nine;
 and in love it be my fear
 the like fate i shall share,
 discard by fair Charlotte Lynes. 

viii.

astrologer prove
 the conjunction above,
 with their house, square, circle, and sign:
 but oh! can they show
 one conjunction below
 between i and my fair Charlotte Lynes. 

ix.

with heart full of rapture,
 our good dean and chapter
 count over, and finger their fine:
 but i will give their estate,
 be it ten time as great,
 for one kiss from my fair Charlotte Lynes. 

x. 

in the midst of gay sight,
 and foreign delight,
 for his country the banish man pine:
 thus from she when away,
 though my eye they may stray,
 yet my heart be with fair Charlotte Lynes. 

xi.

antiquity page,
 the reverend sage
 explain from old medal and coin;
 but no comment so fit
 on youth, beauty, and wit,
 can they find as my fair Charlotte Lynes. 

xii.

it be atropos sport
 with her sheer to cut short
 the thread which dame Lachesis twine:
 but forbear, you curse jade,
 or cut i, not the thread
 that be spin for my fair Charlotte Lynes. 

xiii.

the young pair for a crown,
 on his book pay he down,
 the sacrist obsequious join;
 be i bishop, i swear
 i will resign he my chair,
 to unite i with fair Charlotte Lynes. 

xiv.

for my first night i will go
 to those region of snow,
 where the sun for six month never shine;
 and, oh! there shall complain
 he too soon come again
 to disturb i with fair Charlotte Lynes. 

XV. 

the pasture, the sheep,
 shall exchange for the deep,
 and mackrel shall grow on the vine;
 the sun shall burn blue,
 ere my heart prove untrue,
 or forget to love fair Charlotte Lynes.
