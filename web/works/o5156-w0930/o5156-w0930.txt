VERSES said to be fixed on the Gate of the LOUVRE at PARIS.

1751.

ENGLISH.

By the Same.

OUR fathers' victims the two Henries see,
This to religion, that to liberty. 
Louis, in thee again the tyrants live;
Dread, lest our deep despair those scenes revive.
Paris nor yet a Ravilliac denies,
The church a Clement, nor the court a Guise. 

LATIN.
