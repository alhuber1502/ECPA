a song.

i

Chloe, it be not thy graceful air,
soft wish can impart,
thy face so exquisite fair,
can never subdue my heart;
it be virtue, sense, and truth combine,
with ease and prudence dress,
will captivate the waver mind,
and make a lover bless.

ii

i own soft beauty mighty charm,
yet never feel the smart,
confess your mien my bosom warm,
yet can wound my heart.
it be virtue only, gentle maid,
will constancy demand,
for beauty like a flower will fade,
by time all conquer hand.
