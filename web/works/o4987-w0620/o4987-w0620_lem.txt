rural simplicity.

a ode.

by the same.

o thou, who love and fancy lead
 to wander near this woodland hill,
 if ever music soothe thy quill,
 or pity wake thy gentle reed,
 repose beneath my humble tree,
 if thou love simplicity. 

stranger, if thy lot have lay
 in toilsome scene of busy life,
 full sore may thou see the strife
 of weary passion ill repay,
 in a garden live like i,
 if thou love simplicity. 

flower have spring for many a year
 over the village-maiden grave,
 that, one memorial-sprig to save,
 bear it from a sister bier;
 and homeward walk, weep over i
 the true tear of simplicity. 

and soon, her cottage-window near,
 with care my slender stem she place,
 and fond thus her grief embrace,
 and cherish sad remembrance dear;
 for love sincere and friendship free
 be child of simplicity. 

when past be many a painful day,
 slow-pacing over the village-green
 in white be all its maiden see,
 and bear my guardian friend away. 
ah, death! what sacrifice to thou
 the ruin of simplicity! 

one generous swain her heart approve,
 a youth, who fond and faithful breast. 
with many a artless sigh confess,
 in nature language that he love:
 but, stranger, it be no tale for thou,
 unless thou love simplicity. 

he die — and soon her lip be cold,
 and soon her rosy lip be pale,
 the village weep to hear the tale
 when for both the slow bell toll —
 beneath yond flowery turf they lie,
 the lover of simplicity. 

yet one boon have i to crave;
 stranger, if thy pity bleed,
 will thou do one tender deed,
 and strew my pale flower over their grave? 
so light lie the turf on thou,
 because thou love simplicity!
