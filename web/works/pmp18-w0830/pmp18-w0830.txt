On the Same.

Helen was just slipt into Bed:
 Her Eye-brows on the Toilet lay:
 Away the Kitten with them fled,
 As Fees belonging to her Prey. 

For this Misfortune careless Jane,
 Assure your self, was loudly rated:
 And Madam getting up again,
 With her own Hand the Mouse-Trap baited. 

On little Things, as Sages write,
 Depends our Human Joy, or Sorrow:
 If We don't catch a Mouse To-night,
 Alas! no Eye-brows for To-morrow.
