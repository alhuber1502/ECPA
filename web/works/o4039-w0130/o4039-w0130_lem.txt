to mr. holland.

what number, holland, can the muse find,
 to sing thy merit in each vary part;
 when action, eloquence, and ease combine,
 make nature but a copy of thy art. 

majestic as the eagle on the wing,
 or the young sky-helmed mountain-rooted tree;
 please as meadow blush with the spring,
 loud as the surge of the Severn sea. 

in terror strain, as clang army drear! 
in love, as Jove, too great for mortal praise,
 in pity gentle as the fall tear,
 in all superior to my feeble lay. 

black anger sudden rise, ecstatic pain,
 torment jealousy self-cank'ring sting;
 consume envy with her yell train,
 fraud close shroud with the turtle wing. 

whatever passion gall the human breast,
 play in thy feature, and await thy nod;
 in thou by art, the daemon stand confess,
 but nature on thy soul have stamp the god. 

so just thy action with thy part agree,
 each feature do the office of a tongue;
 such be thy native elegance and ease,
 by thou the harsh line smooth glide along. 

at thy feign woe, we be real distress,
 at thy feign tear we let the real fall;
 by every judge of nature it be confess,
 no single part be thy, thou be all in all.
