to JAMES Forbes, ESQ.

on his bring i flower from Vaucluse, and which he have preserve by mean of a ingenious process in their original beauty.

sweet spoil of consecrate bower,
 how dear to i these choose flower! 
i love the simple bud that blow,
 i love the mean weed that grow:
 symbol of nature — every form
 that speak of her this heart can warm;
 but you, delicious flower, assume
 in fancy eye a bright bloom;
 a dear pleasure you diffuse,
 cull by the fountain of Vaucluse! 
for you be nurture on the sod
 where Petrarch mourn, and Laura tread;
 you grow on that inspire ground
 where love have shed enchantment round;
 where still the tear of passion flow,
 fond tribute to a poet woe! 
yet, cherish flower, with love and fame
 this wreath entwine a mild name;
 friendship, who better know than they
 the spell that smooth our lengthen way, —
 friendship the bloom offer bring;
 when Forbes the classic fountain seek,
 for i he cull the fresh-blow flower,
 and fix their hue with potent power;
 their pliant form with skilful care
 he seize, and stamp duration there;
 his gift shall ever glad the eye, —
 nor, like my verse be bear to die.
