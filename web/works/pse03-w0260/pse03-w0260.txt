A SONG.

How pleasant is Love,
 When forbid or unknown;
 Was my Passion approv'd,
 It would quickly be gone. 

It adds to the Charms,
 When we steal the Delight;
 Why should Love be expos'd? 
Since himself has no Sight. 

In some Silvan Shade,
 Let me sigh for my Swain;
 Where none but an Eccho,
 Will speak on't again. 

Thus silent and soft,
 I'll pass the Time on;
 And when I grow weary,
 I'll make my Love known.
