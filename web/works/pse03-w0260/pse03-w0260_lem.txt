a song.

how pleasant be love,
 when forbid or unknown;
 be my passion approve,
 it will quick be go. 

it add to the charm,
 when we steal the delight;
 why shall love be expose? 
since himself have no sight. 

in some silvan shade,
 let i sigh for my Swain;
 where none but a echo,
 will speak on it again. 

thus silent and soft,
 i will pass the time on;
 and when i grow weary,
 i will make my love know.
