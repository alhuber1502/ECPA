to sensibility.

parent of ecstasy and woe,
 who sparkle eye impearl with tear,
 who vary cheek grow pale, and glow,
 with groundless hope, with groundless fear! 

cease, soft enchantress, over my breast
 thus to exert thy magic sway;
 no more this ache heart molest,
 too long thy weak, defenceless prey! 

each momentary boast joy,
 which to your votary you give,
 each transient sweet too short to cloy,
 but ill thy last pang relieve. 
then, free from bliss, from anguish free,
 leave i to dull tranquillity!
