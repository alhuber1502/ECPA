To the Honourable Mrs. Percival, with Hutcheson's Treatise on Beauty and Order.

By Mrs. Grierson.

Th' internal Senses painted here we see:
 They're born in others, but they live in thee. 
O were our Author with thy Converse blest,
 Could he behold the Virtues, of thy Breast;
 His needless Labours with Contempt he'd view;
 And bid the World not read â€” but copy you!
