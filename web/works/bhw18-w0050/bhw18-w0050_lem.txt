Duncan,

a ode.

i 

abash the rebel squadron yield —
 Macbeth, the victor of the field,
 exult, past the blast wild;
 and where his dark overhang tower
 frown on the heath, with pleasure mild
 now Duncan hastes to wing the hour —
 sweet be the rosy beam that chase
 the angry tempest from the sky;
 when wind have shake the mountain base,
 sweet be the zephyr balmy sigh;
 but sweet to the breast the social charm
 who grateful rapture sooth the toil of arm. 

ii.

it be not the season when the storm
 of winter wear its savage form;
 blacken all, the freeze north
 wild spread its awful wing,
 from yond bare summit rush forth,
 and on that barren desert, fling
 all the rapid torrent may,
 when with turbulence they sweep,
 mingle, with the wind of might,
 sound majestical deep —
 when nature form the hideous waste, she frown,
 and give to horror its desert bound. 

iii.

it be not the hour when magic spell
 rock the heath untrodden cell;
 when slow the wither form arise
 from cave, which night with last sway,
 ever shroud from mortal eye,
 nor divide one hour with day —
 sound unmeet for mortal ear
 chill with dread the human frame,
 then unreal shape appear
 by the blue unhallowed flame —
 discordance strange disturb the gentle air,
 and poisonous taint the thicken breeze bear. 

iv.

the western sun depart ray
 bright on the lofty turret lie,
 that throw the shadow lengthen line
 at solemn distance far below;
 and where the gather cloud recline
 on yond dark cliff terrific brow,
 there stand a venerable seer,
 who prophetic soul can trace
 distant age hasten near,
 and all that fill the unborn space —
 the prophet gaze, with sudden frenzy fire,
 see deed undo, and speak with lip inspire:

v. 

 "hail, scotia monarch! great brave,
 skill to conquer, charm to save! 
who pity hand invert the lance,
 and meek drop the slacken bow;
 who gracious eye with mercy glance
 have ever gaze on human woe! —
 Macbeth, the castle gate unbar,
 Macbeth, prepare the social board —
 haste, from rugged toil of war,
 haste, and hail thy sovereign lord! 
with music be the genial banquet crown,
 and bid thy vault roof with joy rebound. 

vi.

 "ha! — dread vision hang in air! —
 i see a bloody dagger glare! —
 deed that ask the gloom of night
 be image in yond trouble sky —
 now a gleam of fatal light
 flash on my ache eye! 
Duncan, shun that conscious tower —
 fiend the social banquet pile! —
 murder wait the midnight hour,
 murder lurk in beauty smile! 
vain my prophetic voice! — he hie away
 where, scowl over the couch, death call his prey. 

vii.

 "sacred victim! bathe in gore,
 haunt the hideous scene no more —
 rest, unquiet spirit, rest! 
great revenge the heaven prepare;
 view thy murder torture breast,
 and pity all that labour there! 
see the look, and hear the groan,
 mark a bleed soul in pain! 
reason tremble on her throne,
 fury seize the burn brain —
 unpitied, and accurse shall be his doom,
 while rise honour flourish round thy tomb. 

viii.

 "thy memory shall for ever last,
 and fame, untired, repeat the past —
 deep in the mystic cloud of time
 i see a poet call to birth —
 i hear a lyre, who source sublime
 with wonder thrill the listen earth! 
the mighty bard, with 'potent art,'
 shall nature perfect semblance give,
 unlock the spring that move the heart,
 and bid the human passion live —
 still in his heaven-taught page shall Duncan bleed,
 and future age tremble as they read!"
