Disappointed.

I.

FRom Clime to Clime with restless toyl we Roam,
But sadly still our old Griefs we Retain,
And with us bear (tho we out-rove the Main)
The same disquiet selves we brought from Home!
Can Nature's plenteous Board
Spread wide from Pole to Pole,
Sufficient Cates afford
To Satiate or Delude one Craving Soul? 
Produce what wealth the Sea contains,
Or sleeps deep lodg'd in Indian Veins,
Th' Insatiate Mind will gorge the store
And call for more.

II.

The Food of Angels of immortal kind,
Alone can be design'd
To Feast th'unbounded Appetite o'th' Mind. 
To those bright Seats let me aspire
Where solid joys remain,
So firm they can sustain,
And stand the full Career of Chast Desire. 
Th'Enjoyments we pursue
So hotly here below,
Are Charming Daphnes in the Chase
And (Daphne-like) Transforming, Fool us in th'Embrace!
