to Apollo make love.

from monsieur Fontenelle.

by THOMAS Tickell, ESQ.

i be, cry Apollo, when Daphne he woo,
 and pant for breath, the coy virgin pursue,
 when his wisdom, in manner most ample, express
 the long list of the grace his godship possess:
 i be the god of sweet song, and inspirer of lay;
 nor for lay, nor sweet song, the fair fugitive stay:
 i be the god of the harp — stop, my fair — in vain;
 nor the harp, nor the harper, can fetch she again. 
every plant, every flower, and their virtue i know,
 god of light i be above, and of physic below:
 at the dreadful word physic, the nymph flee more fast;
 at the fatal word physic, she double her haste. 
thou fond god of wisdom, then alter thy phrase,
 bid she view thy young bloom, and thy ravish ray,
 tell she less of thy knowledge, and more of thy charm,
 and, my life for it, the damsel shall fly to thy arm.
