[Martial] Lib. 1. Epigr. XIV.

De Arriâ & Paeto.

WHen from her Breast Chast Arria did unsheath
The reeking Sword, & led the way to Death '
The blushing Steel to her Lov'd Lord she gave,
And said — Tho Wretched, let us still be Brave!
Ah that I might prevent thy Fate with Mine:
At my own Breast I Bleed, but Smart in Thine.
