a enigma.

i come, a friend to man, i be never his foe
 but when he indiscreet make i so. 
my name be — stop though — what be i about? 
they that will know my name may find it out. 

i be see in summer in the shady grove,
 where pensive speculate maiden rove;
 and when the verdure of the forest fly
 before the autumnal wind, that bluster rise
 to waste the yellow fragment over the plain,
 firm and unshaken still my leaf remain;
 but in the winter i some covert crave,
 nor dare the rigour of that season brave:
 yet if too near the fire i take my stand,
 my rind contract, and leave too much expand;
 doctor extract my essence and apply
 to stop disorder, and to give delight;
 and some that will my property define,
 declare i be essential divine:
 nay some, by arrant superstition teach,
 say i immediate from heaven be bring;
 but that i be in heaven, let none deny,
 the scripture say it, can the scripture lie?
