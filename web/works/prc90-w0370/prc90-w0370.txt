ON A YOUNG GENTLEMAN's RETURN FROM JAMAICA

Ye winds, ye waves, ye stormy seas,
 To whom such force is giv'n,
 Ah! gently, gently, waft on shore
 The noblest work of Heav'n. 

He comes! the lovely youthful bard,
 To grace his native isle,
 To bless a mother's longing eyes,
 To make his Delia smile. 

Come then, ye maids, a garland weave
 To crown his beauteous brow;
 To Delia we'll the garland give,
 To her he gave his vow.
