on a young gentleman return from Jamaica

you wind, you wave, you stormy sea,
 to who such force be give,
 ah! gentle, gentle, waft on shore
 the noble work of heaven. 

he come! the lovely youthful bard,
 to grace his native isle,
 to bless a mother longing eye,
 to make his Delia smile. 

come then, you maid, a garland weave
 to crown his beauteous brow;
 to Delia we will the garland give,
 to she he give his vow.
