song.

write in the year 1732. 

by the same.

i 

when Delia on the plain appear,
I will by a thousand tender fear,
i will approach, but dare not move; —
tell i, my heart, if this be love.

ii.

whenever she speak, my ravish ear
no other voice but she can hear,
no other wit but she approve; —
tell i, my heart, if this be love.

iii.

if she some other youth commend,
though i be once his fond friend,
his instant enemy i prove; —
tell i, my heart, if this be love.

iv.

when she be absent, i no more
delight in all that please before,
the clear spring, or shady grove; —
tell i, my heart, if this be love.

v. 

when fond of power, of beauty vain,
her net she spread for every swain,
i strive to hate, but vain strive; —
tell i, my heart, if this be love.
