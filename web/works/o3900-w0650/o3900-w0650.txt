CHRIST the Friend of Sinners.

I.

WHERE shall my wond'ring Soul begin? 
How shall I All to Heaven aspire? 
A Slave redeem'd from Death and Sin,
 A Brand pluck'd from Eternal Fire,
 How shall I equal Triumphs raise,
 And sing my great Deliverer's Praise! 

II.

O how shall I the Goodness tell,
 Father, which Thou to me hast show'd,
 That I, a Child of Wrath, and Hell,
 I should be call'd a Child of GOD! 
Should know, should feel my Sins forgiven,
 Blest with this Antepast of Heaven! 

III.

And shall I slight my Father's Love,
 Or basely fear his Gifts to own? 
Unmindful of his Favours prove? 
Shall I the hallow'd Cross to shun
 Refuse his Righteousness t'impart
 By hiding it within my Heart? 

IV.

No — tho' the Antient Dragon rage
 And call forth all his Hosts to War,
 Tho' Earth's self-righteous Sons engage;
 Them, and their God alike I dare:
 JESUS the Sinner's Friend proclaim,
 JESUS, to Sinners still the same. 

V.

Outcasts of Men, to You I call,
 Harlots and Publicans, and Thieves! 
He spreads his Arms t'embrace you all;
 Sinners alone his Grace receives:
 No Need of Him the Righteous have,
 He came the Lost to seek and save! 

VI.

Come all ye Magdalens in Lust,
 Ye Ruffians fell in Murders old;
 Repent, and live: despair and trust! 
JESUS for you to Death was sold;
 Tho' Hell protest, and Earth repine,
 He died for Crimes like Yours — and Mine. 

VII.

Come O my guilty Brethren come,
 Groaning beneath your Load of Sin! 
His bleeding Heart shall make you room,
 His open Side shall take you in. 
He calls you Now, invites you home —
 Come, O my guilty Brethren, come! 

VIII.

For you the purple Current flow'd
 In Pardons from his wounded Side:
 Languish'd for you th' Eternal GOD,
 For you the Prince of Glory dy'd. 
Believe; and all your Guilt's forgiven,
 Only Believe — and yours is Heaven.
