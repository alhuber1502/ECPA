prologue, speak at court before the queen, on her majesty birthday, 1704. 

shine forth, you planet, with distinguish light,
 as when you hallow first this happy night:
 again transmit your friendly beam to earth,
 as when Britannia joy for anna birth:
 and thou, propitious star, who sacred power
 preside over the monarch natal hour,
 thy radiant voyage for ever run,
 yield to none but Cynthia, and the sun:
 with thy fair aspect still illustrate heaven:
 kind preserve what thou have great give:
 thy influence for thy Anna we implore:
 prolong one life; and Britain ask no more. 
for virtue can no ampler power express,
 than to be great in war, and good in peace:
 for think no high wish of bliss can frame,
 than to enjoy that virtue still the same. 
entire and sure the monarch rule must prove,
 who found her greatness on her subject love;
 who do our homage for our good require;
 and order that which we shall first desire:
 our vanquish will that please force obey:
 her goodness take our liberty away:
 and haughty Britain yield to arbitrary sway. 

let the young austrian then her terror bear,
 great as he be, her delegate in war:
 let he in thunder speak to both his spain have,
 that in these dreadful isle a woman reign. 
while the bright queen do on her subject shower
 the gentle blessing of her soft power;
 give sacred moral to a vicious age,
 to temple zeal, and manner to the stage;
 bid the chaste muse without a blush appear,
 and wit be that which heaven and she may hear. 

Minerva thus to Perseus lend her shield;
 secure of conquest, send he to the field:
 the hero act what the queen ordain:
 so be his fame complete, and andromede unchain. 

mean time amid her native temple sit
 the goddess, studious of her grecian fate;
 teach they in law and letter to excel,
 in act just, and in write well. 
thus while she do her various power dispose,
 the world be free from tyrant, war, and woe:
 virtue be teach in verse, and athen glory rise.
