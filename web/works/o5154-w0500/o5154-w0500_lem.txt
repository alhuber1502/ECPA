verse write in a book call, fable for the female sex. 

by the same.

while here the poet point the charm
which bless the perfect dame,
how unaffected beauty warm,
and wit preserve the flame;

how prudence, virtue, sense agree,
to form the happy wife:
in LUCY, and her book, i see,
the picture, and the life.
