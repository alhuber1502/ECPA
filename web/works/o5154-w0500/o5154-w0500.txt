VERSES written in a Book called, Fables for the Female Sex. 

By the Same.

WHILE here the poet points the charms
Which bless the perfect dame,
How unaffected beauty warms,
And wit preserves the flame;

How prudence, virtue, sense agree,
To form the happy wife:
In LUCY, and her book, I see,
The Picture, and the Life.
