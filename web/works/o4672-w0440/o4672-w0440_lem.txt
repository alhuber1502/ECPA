to my brother E. and T. W.  

false greatness.

i 

brother, forbear to call he bless
 that only have a large estate,
 shall all the treasure of the west
 meet and conspire to make he great. 
let a broad stream with golden sand
 through all his meadow roll,
 he be but a wretch with all his land
 that wear a narrow soul. 

ii.

he swell amid his wealthy store,
 and proud poize what he weigh,
 in his own scale he fond lay
 huge heap of shine oar,
 he spread the balance wide to hold
 his manor and his farm,
 and cheat the beam with load of gold
 he hug between his arm.
 so may the plough-boy climb a tree,
 when craesus mount his throne,
 and both stand up and smile to see
 how long their shadow groan;
 alas! how vain their fancy be,
 to think that shape their own. 

iii.

thus mingle still with wealth and state
 craesus himself can never know;
 his true dimension, and his weight
 be far inferior to their show;
 be i so tall to reach the pole,
 or grasp the ocean with my span,
 i must be measure by my soul. 
the mind be the standard of the man.
