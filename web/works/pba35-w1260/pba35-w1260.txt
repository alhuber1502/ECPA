Verses written by Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe, on her drawing the Lord Boyle's Picture.

In vain, with mimic Skill, my Pencil tries
 To paint the Life, that sparkles in those Eyes. 
What Art, what Rules of Symmetry can trace
 That Air of Wit, that Bloom, and modest Grace? 
What soft Degrees of Shade or Light express
 The inward Worth, those speaking Looks confess? 
'Tis more than Beauty here, that charms the Sight,
 And gives our Souls an elegant Delight:
 Were Virtue seen to mortal Eyes, she'd wear
 Those peaceful Smiles, and that engaging Air.
