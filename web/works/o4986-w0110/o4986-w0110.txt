TO A LADY, WITH AN ETUI.

BY THE SAME.

WHAT Friendship gives, sweet girl, approve,
 They well deserve, who well design;
 Then may this trifle speak his love,
 Whose constant heart has long been thine. 

Oft may each toy by you employ'd,
 Revive his image in your heart â€”
 Or if the tender pen you guide,
 Or shape the lawn with nicest art;

Or of its rough coat strip the pear,
 Or pick your teeth, or sip your tea;
 Whate'er you do, where'er you are,
 Think, dear Maria, think on me.
