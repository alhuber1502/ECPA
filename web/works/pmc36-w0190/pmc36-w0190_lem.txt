to mrs. ward.

sapphira line with wit and humour fraught,
 pure as her moral, sprightly as her thought;
 fill with compassion for the poor distress,
 and flow from a grateful generous breast,
 my muse will sing. â€” but swift approve her lay,
 apollo swift anticipate my praise. 
will Delia pardon, if i dare rehearse
 her strephon praise in my unpolished verse? 
where soul replete with learning, sense, and truth;
 himself alone unknowing of his worth:
 graceful amid sapphira work he stand
 pre-eminent, and every eye command;
 who sing with genius, elegance, and art,
 to warm the passion, and enlarge the heart. 
sublime in sentiment, in diction pure,
 his shall the critic keen pen endure;
 and stand the rage of conquer time secure. 
a fop let other choose, or wretch they hate;
 to every joy prefer a large estate;
 with toy and equipage, while truth and mind
 be delia taste, and show her soul refine. 
the wise must Delia and her choice approve,
 who will great merit recompense with love;
 good sense must honour, friendship, faith secure,
 while the rich fool grow fickle, false, impure. 
with such a friend what woman will not dare
 to stake some fortune, and the rest to share? 
to hear truth flow melodious from his tongue,
 and have her name immortalise in song. 
such force of merit must successful prove,
 bay crown his head, while beauty crown his love.
