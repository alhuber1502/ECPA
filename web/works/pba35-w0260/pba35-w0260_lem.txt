a letter write for my daughter to a lady, who have present she with a Cap. 

your late kind gift let i restore;
 for i must never wear it more. 
my mother cry, "what be here to do? 
"a crimson velvet cap for you! 
 "if to these height so soon you climb,
"you will wear a coachman cap in time:
 "perhaps on palfry pace along,
"with ruffle shirt, and tete-moutton;
 "banish the woman from your face,
"and let the rake supply the place;
 "delight see the people stare,
"and ask each other what you be? 

if she go on to this dull tune,
 poor i must be a Quaker soon. 
she will scarce let i wear a knot;
 but keep i like a Hottentot;
 say, dress plain, at small expense,
 show better taste, and better sense. 
i will take she judgement, i confess,
 soon in any thing, than dress;
 a science, which she little know,
 who only huddle on her clothes. 

this day, to please my brother Con.  
she let i put your present on;
 and when she see i very glad,
 cry out, she look like one that be mad! 
 "know, girl, (say she) that affectation
"suit only those in high station;
 "who plead prescription for their rule,
"whenever they please to play the fool:
 "but that it best become we cit,
"to dress like people in their wit. "
