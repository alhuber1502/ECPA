in memory of mr. Agostino isola, of Cambridge,

who die on the 5th of June, 1797. 

awake, o gratitude! nor let the tear
 of selfish sorrow smother up thy voice,
 when it shall speak of a depart friend. 
a tender friend, the first i ever lose! 
for destiny till now be merciful,
 and though i oft have feel a transient pang,
 for worth unknown, and weep awhile for those,
 who long acquaintance only make i love,
 no keen regret lay pine at my heart,
 nor memory in the solitary hour,
 will sting my soul with grief, as when she speak
 thy virtue knowledge, wisdom, gentleness,
 thy venerable age, and say that i
 have once the happiness to call thou friend. 

yes! i once bear that title, and my heart
 think noble of itself, that one so good,
 so honour, so revere, shall give it i. 
o isola! when that glad season come,
 which bring redemption to a ruin world,
 and, like thou, hide beneath the snow of age,
 a gay, benevolent, and feel heart,
 i hope again to hear thy tongue repeat,
 with youthful warmth and zealous energy,
 those passage, where poetry assume
 a air divine, and wake the attentive soul
 to holy rapture! then you promise i
 the luxury to weep over dante muse,
 and fair italia lofty poet hail. 

i have often hear
 that year will blunt the feeling of the soul,
 and apathy ice the once-glowing heart. 
injurious prejudice! dear, guileless friend! 
thou read mankind, but see not, or forget
 their fault and vice; for thy breast be still
 the residence of sweet simplicity,
 daughter of letter wisdom, and the friend
 of love and pity. happy soul, farewell! 
long shall we mourn thou! long will it be,
 "ere we shall look upon thy like again!"
