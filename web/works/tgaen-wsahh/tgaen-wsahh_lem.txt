satire on the head of house; or, never a barrel the better herring

o Cambridge, attend
to the satire i have pen
on the head of thy house,
thou seat of the muse!
know the master of Jesus
do huge displease we;
the master of maudlin
in the same dirt be dawdle;
the master of Sidney
be of the same kidney;
the master of trinity
to he bear affinity;
as the master of key
be as like as two pea,
so the master of queen
be as like as two bean;
the master of king
copy they in all thing;
the master of Catherine
take they all for his pattern;
the master of clare
hit they all to a hair;
the master of Christ
by the rest be entice;
but the master of Emmanuel
follow they like a spaniel;
the master of Benet
be of the like tenet;
the master of Pembroke
have from they his system take;
the master of Peter
have all the same feature;
the master of saint John
like the rest of the don.

p.s. â€” as to trinity hall
we say nothing at all.
