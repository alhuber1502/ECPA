A Dutch Proverb.

Fire, Water, Woman, are Man's Ruin;
 Says wise Professor Vander Brüin. 
By Flames a House I hir'd was lost
 Last Year: and I must pay the Cost. 
This Spring the Rains o'erflow'd my Ground:
 And my best Flanders Mare was drown'd. 
A Slave I am to Clara's Eyes:
 The Gipsey knows her Pow'r, and flies. 
Fire, Water, Woman, are My Ruin:
 And great Thy Wisdom, Vander Brüin.
