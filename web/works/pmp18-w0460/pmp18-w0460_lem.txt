a dutch proverb.

fire, water, woman, be man ruin;
 say wise professor Vander brüin. 
by flame a house i hire be lose
 last year: and i must pay the cost. 
this spring the rain overflow my ground:
 and my best Flanders mare be drown. 
a slave i be to clara eye:
 the Gipsey know her power, and fly. 
fire, water, woman, be my ruin:
 and great thy wisdom, Vander Brüin.
