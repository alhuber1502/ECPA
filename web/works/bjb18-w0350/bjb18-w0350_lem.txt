rhyme for chant.

butterfly, butterfly, speed through the air,
 the ring-bird follow thou fast,
 and the monkey look up with a greedy stare;
 speed on till the peril be pass! 

o, be thou but safe in my garden bower,
 and will thou not further stray,
 thou shall feed on the rose and the gillyflower,
 and be my playmate gay.
