To the Right Honourable the Lady Kilmorey, with a Letter, which was written by the late Lady Roydon, of the Kingdom of Ireland, just before her Death.

Start not, nor tremble at the Sight of this;
 It comes not written from the Realms of Bliss:
 'Tis true, you see, your once-lov'd Roydon's Hand;
 Thence may conclude from Heav'n some high Command;
 Conscious perhaps of your celestial Frame,
 You think you're call'd to Worlds from whence you came. 
Not so â€” but ere her Soul began its Flight,
 She thought of you, and staid a-while to write;
 Kindly for me her dying Suit address'd:
 Then view it, Madam, as her last Request.
