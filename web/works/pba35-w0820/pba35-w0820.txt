Occasion'd by seeing the Honourable â€” treat a Person of Merit with Insolence, who came to make a Request to her.

Contented in my humble State,
 I look with Pity on the Great;
 Who only Birth, or Wealth, respect,
 And treat true Merit with neglect. 

O Pow'r supreme! let me implore
 Some Little from thy boundless Store! 
Give me a constant, small Support,
 Without the Plague of paying Court! 
Let none but Fools, who pine to rise,
 Be curs'd to bow, where they despise.
