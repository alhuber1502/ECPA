occasion by see the honourable â€” treat a person of merit with insolence, who come to make a request to she.

content in my humble state,
 i look with pity on the great;
 who only birth, or wealth, respect,
 and treat true merit with neglect. 

o power supreme! let i implore
 some little from thy boundless store! 
give i a constant, small support,
 without the plague of pay court! 
let none but fool, who pine to rise,
 be curse to bow, where they despise.
