on the invention of letter.

tell i what genius do the art invent,
the lively image of the voice to paint;
who first the secret how to colour sound,
and to give shape to reason, wise find;
with body how to cloth idea, teach;
and how to draw the picture of a thought:
who teach the hand to speak, the eye to hear
a silent language rove far and near;
who soft noise outstrip loud thunder sound,
and spread her accent through the world vast round:
a voice hear by the deaf, speak by the dumb,
who echo reach long, long time to come;
which dead man speak as well as those alive â€”
tell i what genius do this art contrive.
