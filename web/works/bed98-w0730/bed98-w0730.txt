WISDOM.

INFINITE Wisdom! nature's source
Whate'er thy hand has wrought,
Each in its rank pursues its course,
By thee divinely taught.

Thy heavens in dazzling beauty shine,
And silent order move;
And still fulfilling thy design,
Their Maker's wisdom prove.

Nor needs the eye of man to soar
Beyond his own abode;
Whate'er its search can there explore,
Proclaims alike a God.

Earth fill'd with life, with beauty dress'd,
Thy wisdom's work and care;
Whilst Man, its lord, high o'er the rest,
Appears a wonder there.

His curious frame, more curious mind,
His heart, with feeling fraught;
By heavenly wisdom were design'd,
And wonderfully wrought.

God not to lower being gave,
Reason, man's suited guide;
But order'd instinct there to save,
Where reason was denied.

Upon thy wisdom, mighty lord,
Shall thy creation rest;
It safe protection can afford,
And still contrives the best.

Its means are sure, its end is right,
In each unerring plan;
Thro' all thy works it beams its light,
Upon the mind of man.

Oh may these thoughts possess my mind,
Inspire my hope and trust;
Since whatsoever God design'd,
Is wisest, best, most just.
