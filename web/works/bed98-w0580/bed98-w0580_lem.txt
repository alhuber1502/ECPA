song.

no constancy here dwell,
upon our earthly ground:
but like the merry bell,
all have their change round.

to the poor infant cry,
succeed gay youthful bloom;
then strength and wisdom rise,
till second childhood come.

and riches make they wing,
and take themselves away;
then friendship from you fling,
nor will a moment stay.

and health that gild our day,
may pallid sickness shade:
and while our frame decay,
our pleasure too must fade.

then shall the young sustain,
and lend their strength to age;
that they may comfort gain,
in life conclude stage.

though fickle fortune frown,
let friend be true and kind;
lest wealth from they be fly,
and they no friendship find.

for constancy here never dwell,
upon our earthly ground:
but like the merry bell,
all have their change round.
