the 53d53d chapter of Isaiah.

1

who have believe the tiding? who? 
or feel the joy our word impart? 
glad confess our record true,
 and find the saviour in his heart? 
plant in nature barren ground,
 and cherish by jehovah care,
 there shall the immortal seed be find,
 the root divine shall flourish there! 

2

see the desire of nation come;
 nor outward pomp bespeak he near,
 a veil of flesh the god assume,
 a servant form he stoop to wear;
 he lay his every glory by;
 ignoble low, obscure mean,
 of beauty void, in reason eye,
 the source of loveliness be see. 

3

reject and despise of man,
 a man of grief, inure to woe;
 his only intimate be pain,
 and grief be all his life below. 
we see, and from the irksome sight
 disdainful our face turn;
 hell follow he with fierce despite,
 and earth the humble object scorn. 

4

sure for we he humble be,
 and grieve with sorrow not his own:
 of all his woe be we the cause,
 we fill his soul with pang unknown. 
yet he the offender we esteem,
 strike by heaven vindictive rod,
 afflict for himself we deem,
 and punish by a angry god. 

5

but o! with our transgression stain,
 for our offence he wound be;
 we be the sin that bruise and pain
 and scourge, and nail he to the cross. 
the chastisement that buy our peace,
 to sinner due, on he be lay:
 conscience be still! thy terror cease! 
the debt discharge, the ransom pay. 

6

what though we all as wander sheep
 have leave our god, and love to stray,
 refuse his mild command to keep,
 and mad urge the downward way;
 father, on he thy bolt do fall,
 the mortal law thy son fulfil,
 thou lay on he the guilt of all,
 and by his stripe we all be heal. 

7

accuse his mouth he open not,
 he answer not by wrong oppress;
 pure though he be from sinful spot
 what guilt he silent confess! 
meek as a lamb to slaughter lead,
 a sheep before his shearer dumb
 to suffer in the sinner stead
 behold the spotless victim come! 

8

who can his heavenly birth declare
 when bind by man he silent stand,
 when worm arraign he at their bar,
 and doom to death the eternal god! 
patient the suffering to sustain
 the vengeance to transgressor due,
 guiltless he groan and die for man:
 sinner rejoice, he die for you! 

9

for your impute guilt he bleed,
 make sin a sinful world to save;
 meek he sink among the dead:
 the rich supply a honour grave? 
for o! devoid of sin, and free
 from actual or intail offence,
 no sinner in himself be he,
 but pure and perfect innocence. 

10

yet he the almighty father will,
 with bruise chastisement pursue,
 doom he the weight of sin to feel,
 and stern just require his blood. 
but lo! the mortal debt be pay,
 the costly sacrifice be over,
 his soul for sin a offer make
 revive, and he shall die no more. 

11

his numerous seed he now shall see,
 scatter through all the earth abroad,
 bless with his immortality,
 beget by he, and bear of god. 
head to his church over all below
 long shall he here his son sustain;
 their bound heart his power shall know,
 and bless the love messiah reign. 

12

betwixt god and they he still shall stand
 the child who his sire have give,
 their cause shall prosper in his hand
 while righteousness look down from heaven. 
while please he count the ransom race. 
and call and draw they from above;
 the travail of his soul survey,
 and rest in his redeem love. 

13

it be do! my justice ask no more,
 the satisfaction full make:
 their sin he in his body bear;
 their surety all the debt have pay. 
my righteous servant and my son
 shall each believe sinner clear,
 and all, who stoop t'abjure their own,
 shall in his righteousness appear. 

14

they shall he claim his just desert,
 they his inheritance receive,
 and many a contrite humble heart
 will i for his possession give. 
Satan he thence shall chase away,
 assert his right, his foe overcome;
 strong than hell, retrieve the prey,
 and bear the spoil triumphant home. 

15

for charge with all their guilt he stand,
 sinner from suffer to redeem,
 for they he pour out all his blood,
 their substitute, he die for they. 
he die; and rise his death to plead,
 to testify their sin forgive â€”
 and still i hear he intercede,
 and still he make their claim to heaven!
