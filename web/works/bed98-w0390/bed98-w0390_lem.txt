sonnet to Celia.

no theme the poet more have mourn,
or fade more his bay;
than flattery the world have scorn,
for flattery be not praise.

but Celia, while my song shall live,
thy merit too shall shine;
thy worth to praise can sanction give,
and to preserve by i.

when what thou be and they shall be,
the fair in future read,
they, proud of emulate thou,
shall thy example lead.

the beauty who thy pattern warm,
no vanity shall stain;
for though adorn with beauty charm,
Celia be never vain.

her graceful form, her heavenly smile,
her cheek of vermil dye;
kind nature lavish all her spoil,
my Celia to supply.

the damask rise and lily fair,
and coral, sea beneath;
the grace give her win air,
the spring her balmy breath.

mild as fair summer set sun,
be her benignant eye;
her voice accord heart have win,
and discord tune to joy.

but nature gift improve we find,
fair Celia can impart;
charm point by her culture mind,
and virtue of her heart.
