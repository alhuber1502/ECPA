SONG.

WHERE the green ivy twining,
 Binds round the ruins brow,
 I heard a voice complaining
 In numbers sad and low. 

 "Alas! she's gone for ever,
 Now low in earth she lies;
 And I, forlorn, shall never
 Behold those speaking eyes. 

 "The pangs of grief beguiling,
 She sooth'd our parting hour;
 Amidst her tears soft smiling,
 Like sunbeams thro' a shower. 

 "But, ah! she's gone for ever,
 Now low in earth she lies,
 And I, forlorn, must never
 Behold those speaking eyes."
