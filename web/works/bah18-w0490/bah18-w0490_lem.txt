song.

where the green ivy twine,
 bind round the ruin brow,
 i hear a voice complain
 in number sad and low. 

 "alas! she be go for ever,
 now low in earth she lie;
 and i, forlorn, shall never
 behold those speak eye. 

 "the pang of grief beguile,
 she soothe our part hour;
 amid her tear soft smile,
 like sunbeam through a shower. 

 "but, ah! she be go for ever,
 now low in earth she lie,
 and i, forlorn, must never
 behold those speak eye."
