ode, in imitation of pastor Fido.

(o primavera gioventu del Anno.) write abroad in 1729. 

by the same.

i 

parent of bloom flower and gay desire,
youth of the tender year, delightful spring,
at who approach, inspire with equal fire,
the amorous nightingale and poet sing.

ii.

again do thou return, but not with thou
return the smile hour i once possess;
blessing thou bring to other, but to i
the sad remembrance, that i once be bless.

iii.

thy fade charm, which winter snatch away,
renew in all their former lustre shine;
but ah! no more shall hapless i be gay,
or know the vernal joy that have be i.

iv.

though linnet sing, though flower adorn the green,
though on their wing soft zephyr fragrance bear;
harsh be the music, joyless be the scene,
the odour faint; for Delia be not there.

v. 

cheerless and cold i feel the genial sun,
from thou while absent i in exile rove;
thy lovely presence, fair light, alone
can warm my heart to gladness and to love.
