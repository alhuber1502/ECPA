GAL. iii. 22. The Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the Promise by Faith of JESUS CHRIST might be given to them that believe.

I.

JESU, the Sinner's Friend, to Thee
 Lost and undone for Aid I flee,
 Weary of Earth, Myself, and Sin —
 Open thine Arms, and take me in. 

II.

Pity and heal my sin-sick Soul,
 'Tis Thou alone canst make me whole,
 Fal'n, till in Me thine Image shine,
 And curst I am till Thou art mine. 

III.

Hear, JESU, hear my helpless Cry,
 O save a Wretch condemn'd to die! 
The Sentence in Myself I feel,
 And all my Nature teems with Hell. 

IV.

When shall Concupiscence and Pride
 No more my tortur'd Heart divide! 
When shall this Agony be o'er,
 And the Old Adam rage no more! 

V.

Awake, the Woman's Conqu'ring Seed,
 Awake, and bruise the Serpent's Head,
 Tread down thy Foes, with Power controul
 The Beast and Devil in my Soul. 

VI.

The Mansion for Thyself prepare,
 Dispose my Heart by Entring there! 
'Tis This alone can make me clean,
 'Tis This alone can cast out Sin. 

VII.

Long have I vainly hop'd and strove
 To force my Hardness into Love,
 To give Thee all thy Laws require;
 And labour'd in the Purging Fire. 

VIII.

A thousand specious Arts essay'd,
 Call'd the deep Mystic to my Aid:
 His boasted Skill the Brute refin'd,
 But left the subtler Fiend behind. 

IX.

Frail, dark, impure, I still remain,
 Nor hope to break my Nature's Chain:
 The fond self-emptying Scheme is past,
 And lo! constrain'd I yield at last. 

X.

At last I own it cannot be
 That I should fit Myself for Thee:
 Here then to Thee, I all resign,
 Thine is the Work, and only Thine. 

XI.

No more to lift my Eyes I dare
 Abandon'd to a just Despair;
 I Have my Punishment in View. 
I Feel a thousand Hells my Due. 

XII.

What shall I say thy Grace to move? 
LORD I am Sin — but Thou art Love:
 I give up every Plea beside
 "LORD I am Damn'd — but Thou hast died! 

XIII.

While groaning at thy Feet I fall
 Spurn me away, refuse my Call,
 If Love permit, contract thy Brow,
 And, if Thou canst, destroy me now!
