girl. iii. 22. the scripture have conclude all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be give to they that believe.

i 

Jesus, the sinner friend, to thou
 lose and undo for aid i flee,
 weary of earth, myself, and sin —
 open thy arm, and take i in. 

ii.

pity and heal my sin-sick soul,
 it be thou alone can make i whole,
 fall, till in i thy image shine,
 and curse i be till thou be i. 

iii.

hear, Jesus, hear my helpless cry,
 o save a wretch condemn to die! 
the sentence in myself i feel,
 and all my nature teem with hell. 

iv.

when shall concupiscence and pride
 no more my torture heart divide! 
when shall this agony be over,
 and the old Adam rage no more! 

v. 

awake, the woman conquer seed,
 awake, and bruise the serpent head,
 tread down thy foe, with power control
 the beast and devil in my soul. 

vi.

the mansion for thyself prepare,
 dispose my heart by entere there! 
it be this alone can make i clean,
 it be this alone can cast out sin. 

vii.

long have i vain hope and strive
 to force my hardness into love,
 to give thou all thy law require;
 and labour in the purge fire. 

viii.

a thousand specious art essay,
 call the deep mystic to my aid:
 his boast skill the brute refine,
 but leave the subtle fiend behind. 

ix.

frail, dark, impure, i still remain,
 nor hope to break my nature chain:
 the fond self-emptying scheme be past,
 and lo! constrain i yield at last. 

x. 

at last i own it can be
 that i shall fit myself for thou:
 here then to thou, i all resign,
 thy be the work, and only thy. 

xi.

no more to lift my eye i dare
 abandon to a just despair;
 i have my punishment in view. 
i feel a thousand hell my due. 

xii.

what shall i say thy grace to move? 
lord i be sin — but thou be love:
 i give up every plea beside
 "lord i be damn — but thou have die! 

xiii.

while groan at thy foot i fall
 spurn i away, refuse my call,
 if love permit, contract thy brow,
 and, if thou can, destroy i now!
