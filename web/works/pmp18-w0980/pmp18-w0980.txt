A FLOWER, Painted by SIMON VARELST.

When fam'd Varelst this little Wonder drew;
 Flora vouchsaf'd the growing Work to view:
 Finding the Painter's Science at a Stand,
 The Goddess snatch'd the Pencil from his Hand;
 And finishing the Piece, She smiling said;
 Behold One Work of Mine, that ne'er shall fade.
