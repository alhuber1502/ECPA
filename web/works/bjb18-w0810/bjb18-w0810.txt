HYMN FOR THE SCOTCH KIRK. 

O GOD! who madest earth, sea and air,
 And living creatures, free and fair,
 Thy hallowed praise is every where,
 Halleluja! 

All blended in the swelling song,
 Are wise and simple, weak and strong,
 Sweet woman's voice and Infant's tongue,
 Halleluja! 

Yea, woods, and winds, and waves convey
 To the rapt ear a hymn, and say
 "He who hath made us we obey,
 Halleluja!"
