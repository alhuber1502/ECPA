hymn for the scotch Kirk. 

o god! who make earth, sea and air,
 and live creature, free and fair,
 thy hallow praise be every where,
 Halleluja! 

all blend in the swell song,
 be wise and simple, weak and strong,
 sweet woman voice and infant tongue,
 Halleluja! 

yea, wood, and wind, and wave convey
 to the rapt ear a hymn, and say
 "he who have make we we obey,
 Halleluja!"
