wit and beauty.

a pastoral.

Celia. 

our shepherd be go over the hill,
 to sport on the neighbour plain;
 let we sit by this murmur rill,
 and sing till they come back again. 

Sylvia. 

we will sing of our favourite swain,
 by who our fond heart be possess;
 and Daphne shall judge of the strain,
 which sing of her shepherd the best. 

Daphne. 

come sing then, and Daphne will hear,
 nor linger the time to prolong;
 and this wreath of rose i wear,
 shall crown the fair victor in song. 

Celia. 

my thirsis be airy and gay,
 his pride be in please the fair;
 he sing and drive sorrow away,
 his humour will banish all care. 

Sylvia. 

to Daphnis the pride of my lay,
 the merit of beauty belong;
 his smile will chase sorrow away,
 as well as your shepherd sine song. 

Celia. 

when pipe my thirsis be see,
 the virgin assemble around;
 and all the blithe swain of the green,
 approve, while they envy the sound. 

Sylvia. 

when Daphnis approach the plain,
 the virgin all blush with surprise;
 with negligence treat their swain,
 and fix on my Daphnis their eye. 

Celia. 

if ever i be pensive and sad,
 or sigh to the evening gale;
 i be cheere by the voice of my lad,
 who tell i a humorous tale. 

Sylvia. 

when i be perplex with fear,
 and nothing can give i delight;
 as soon as my Daphnis appear,
 i languish away at the sight. 

Daphne. 

now cease to contend, my dear lass,
 my wreath i will acknowledge your due;
 nor yet can i tell which surpass,
 your merit you equal show. 

it be Strephon that give i the treasure,
 which now i to you shall impart;
 (that name! o, i speak it with pleasure! 
it ever enrapture my heart.) 

nor Sylvia, nor Celia, shall have it,
 i will just divide it in two;
 believe i, my Strephon, that give it,
 be beautiful, witty, and â€” true.
