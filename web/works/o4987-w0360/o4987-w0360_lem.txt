by the same.

now Delia breathe in wood the fragrant air,
 dull be the heart that still in town remain,
 Venus herself attend on Delia there,
 and Cupid sport amid the sylvan train. 

o with what joy my Delia to behold,
 i will press the spade, or wield the weighty prong,
 guide the slow plough-share through the stubborn mould,
 and patient goad the loiter ox along:

the scorch heat i will careless despise,
 nor heed the blister on my tender hand;
 the great Apollo wear the same disguise,
 like i subdue to love supreme command. 

no heal herb can soothe their master pain,
 the art of physic lose and useless lay,
 to peneus stream, and tempe shady plain,
 he drive his herd beneath the noontide ray:

oft with a bleat lamb in either arm,
 his blush sister see he pace along;
 oft will his voice the silent valley charm,
 till low ox break the tender song. 

where be his triumph? where his warlike toil? 
where by his dart the crest Python slay? 
where be his Delphi? his delightful isle? 
the god himself be grow a cottage swain. 

o Ceres, in your golden field no more
 with harvest cheerful pomp my fair detain, —
 think what for lose proserpina you bear,
 and in a mother anguish feel my pain. 

our wise father leave their field unsown,
 their food be acorn, love their sole employ,
 they meet, they like, they stay but till alone,
 and in each valley snatch the honest joy. 

no wakeful guard, no door to stop desire,
 thrice happy time! — but o i fond rave,
 lead i to Delia, all her eye inspire
 i will do, — i will plough or dig as delia slave.
