on bathe.

a sonnet.

by the same.

when late the tree be strip by winter pale,
fair health, a dryad-maid in vesture green,
rejoice to rove amid the bleak sylvan scene,
on airy upland catch the fragrant gale,
and ere fresh morn the low-couched lark do hail
watch the sound of early horn be see.
but since gay summer, throne in chariot sheen,
be come to scorch each primrose sprinkle dale,
she choose that delightful cave beneath
the crystal treasure of meek isis stream;
and now all glad the temperate air to breathe,
while cool drop distil from arch dim,
bind her dewy lock with sedgy wreath
she sit amid the choir of naiad trim.
