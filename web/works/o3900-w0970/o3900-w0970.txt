From the same.

I.

ALL Glory to th' Eternal Three,
 Of Light and Love th' unfathom'd Sea! 
Whose boundless Pow'r, whose saving Grace,
 Reliev'd me in my deep Distress. 

II.

Still, LORD, from thy exhaustless Store
 Pure Blessing and Salvation show'r;
 Till Earth I leave, and soar away
 To Regions of unclouded Day. 

III.

My Heart from all Pollution clean,
 O purge it, tho' with Grief and Pain:
 To Thee lo! I my All resign,
 Thine be my Will, my Soul be Thine. 

IV.

O guide me, lead me in thy Ways:
 'Tis Thine the sinking Hand to raise. 
O may I ever lean on Thee:
 'Tis Thine to prop the feeble Knee. 

V.

O Father, sanctify this Pain,
 Nor let one Tear be shed in vain! 
Soften, yet arm my Breast: no Fear,
 No Wrath, but Love alone be there. 

VI.

O leave not, cast me not away
 In fierce Temptation's dreadful Day:
 Speak but the Word; instant shall cease
 The Storm, and all my Soul be Peace!
