a song.

when first i see laurinda face,
 i bless the dear surprise,
 for there be sport every grace;
 love wanton in her eye. 

a thousand way she have to move,
 not look and smile alone,
 her shape and mien may conquer Jove;
 and make the god her own. 

but oh! the fair display her charm,
 for conquest, not delight;
 proud deny those lovely arm,
 to which her eye invite.
