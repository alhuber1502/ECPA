[Translation] 4. THE PARROT.

1.

IN painted plumes superbly drest,
 A native of the gorgeous east,
 By many a billow tost;
 Poll gains at length the British shore,
 Part of the captain's precious store,
 A present to his toast. 

2.

Belinda's maids are soon preferr'd
 To teach him now and then a word,
 As Poll can master it;
 But 'tis her own important charge
 To qualify him more at large,
 And make him quite a wit. 

3.

Sweet Poll! his doating mistress cries,
 Sweet Poll! the mimic bird replies,
 And calls aloud for sack,
 She next instructs him in the kiss,
 'Tis now a little one like Miss,
 And now a hearty smack. 

4.

At first he aims at what he hears
 And listening close with both his ears,
 Just catches at the sound;
 But soon articulates aloud,
 Much to th' amusement of the crowd
 And stuns the neighbours round. 

5.

A querulous old woman's voice
 His humorous talent next employs,
 He scolds and gives the lie;
 And now he sings, and now is sick,
 Here Sally, Susan, come, come quick,
 Poor Poll is like to die. 

6.

Belinda and her bird! 'tis rare
 To meet with such a well-match'd pair,
 The language and the tone,
 Each character in every part
 Sustain'd with so much grace and art,
 And both in unison. 

7.

When children first begin to spell
 And stammer out a syllable,
 We think them tedious creatures;
 But difficulties soon abate,
 When birds are to be taught to prate,
 And women are the teachers.
