[translation] 4.  the parrot.

1. 

in paint plume superble dress,
 a native of the gorgeous east,
 by many a billow toss;
 poll gain at length the british shore,
 part of the captain precious store,
 a present to his toast. 

2. 

Belinda maid be soon prefer
 to teach he now and then a word,
 as poll can master it;
 but it be her own important charge
 to qualify he more at large,
 and make he quite a wit. 

3. 

sweet poll! his dote mistress cry,
 sweet poll! the mimic bird reply,
 and call aloud for sack,
 she next instruct he in the kiss,
 it be now a little one like miss,
 and now a hearty smack. 

4. 

at first he aim at what he hear
 and listen close with both his ear,
 just catch at the sound;
 but soon articulate aloud,
 much to the amusement of the crowd
 and stun the neighbour round. 

5. 

a querulous old woman voice
 his humorous talent next employ,
 he scold and give the lie;
 and now he sing, and now be sick,
 here Sally, Susan, come, come quick,
 poor poll be like to die. 

6. 

Belinda and her bird! it be rare
 to meet with such a well-matched pair,
 the language and the tone,
 each character in every part
 sustain with so much grace and art,
 and both in unison. 

7. 

when child first begin to spell
 and stammer out a syllable,
 we think they tedious creature;
 but difficulty soon abate,
 when bird be to be teach to prate,
 and woman be the teacher.
