on the author of religion by reason, or the light of nature a guide to divine truth. 

hail, modest author, who obscure do lie,
 but to prevent our fond idolatry;
 thou have baffle all the writer of the age,
 who be active pen reach the ten thousand page:
 and do commit with so much industry,
 their name in folio to posterity. 
who be wire draw notion and expand sense,
 swell a great volume with as great expense;
 which when we have read the whole prolix design,
 contain not half that be in one page of thy. 
nay, choose the best in thy small tract we see,
 a thousand of they in epitome;
 our way of study be by contemplation,
 revolve thought in the mind by dull succession
 but you seem angel-like pure intuition. 
to what perfection orthography bring,
 how can you write in word so like your thought;
 truth so divine in so refine a stile,
 sure angel view with a consent smile:
 let the bold atheist read thy noble line,
 in every leaf he will see a power divine. 
not long dispute confound the intent,
 but subtle clear convincive argument;
 have hob but see it, that bold dare man,
 himself have burn his own leviathan. 
what sceptic scruple can in man be raise,
 but by your conquer truth may be appease? 
the persian sophi and the papal chair,
 usurp what heaven do sure on you confer. 
the careful student need not any more,
 waste purse and time to turn great volume over,
 your well fraught book in which all truth agree,
 will be itself sufficient library.
