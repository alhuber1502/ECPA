mercy.

it be on thy mercy, gracious lord,
it be on the promise of thy word,
that we thy creature dare depend,
and call thou father, heavenly friend!

o god our maker hear our prayer,
guard we from every sinful snare:
thou may we trust, in thou rejoice,
and nothing hate or fear but vice.

thy pity let our error move;
and oh! our penitence approve:
thou who make we, know how frail,
and thy compassion never fail.

thou on repentance will forgive,
and bid we return and live;
return and every sin abjure;
and let the heart and life be pure.

oh god of mercy! god of love!
if from thy path we ever rove,
let we not long in misery droop,
nor lose our sight of heavenly hope.

if from thy presence wander far,
let not the gate of mercy bar;
but oh repentant may we be,
though it be horror, agony!
