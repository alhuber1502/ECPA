a invitation to Edward Walpole, ESQ; upon hear he be land in Dublin.

when i hear you be land, i fly to the nine,
 entreat their aid to invite you to dine. 
they tell i, i come on that errand too late;
 for you be engage by the rich, and the great. 
already! say i; they be speedy indeed:
 however i will try, and i hope to succeed. 
those creature of power, who your levee attend,
 if your father be out, their conge will end:
 though your personal merit be great, it be allow;
 it be the son of the statesman, that weigh with the croud. 
i expect not a place, nor hope for a pension,
 the love of the muse be my only pretension. 
i hate to abuse — and i never can flatter:
 i write for no party, nor either bespatter. 

from the land of Parnassus the rent be ill-paid,
 and England have cruel cramp we in trade:
 so look not for china, or service of plate,
 or ought that be costly, to tempt you to eat. 
yet a way to engage you i think i have hit on:
 i mean, to remember our friend in Great-Britain. 
two bottle of wine, and two dish i will give:
 then fly from the croud that oppress you — and live. 

the first glass shall welcome you, sir, to our coast;
 and dear lady Conway shall be my next toast. 
with mirth, and good humour, i will make up the treat;
 i know you be too wise, to love dine in state.
