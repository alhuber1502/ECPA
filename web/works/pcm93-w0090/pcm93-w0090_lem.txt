semira.

 "tranquillity, celestial maid,
" why have thou flee my trouble breast? 
 "vain must i implore thy aid,
" and only hope in death for rest? 

 "i once be thy peculiar care,
" in infancy, and early youth:
 "the victim now of blank despair,
" i see thy smile be void of truth. 

 "only to sharpen sorrow dart,
" deceitful friend, you smile on i:
 "but, since you scorn my proffer heart,
" that heart no more shall plead to thou. 

 "but i will invoke thou, gentle death! 
" thou, certain cure for every pain,
 "shall tell i at my late breath,
" our sorrow as our joy be vain. 

 "come, then, kind sooth of my woe,
" prepare for i the welcome grave:
 "on its cold lap i will find repose,
" which live i can never have. " 

thus mourn semira, hapless fair,
 by disappointment sting oppress:
 the pity power receive her prayer,
 and life forsake her woe-worn breast.
