Martialis epigramma.

Lib. vi. ep. 24.  imitate.

by the same.

come, Chloe, and give i sweet kiss,
for sweet sure never girl give:
but why in the midst of my bliss
do you ask i how many i will have?
i be not to be stint in pleasure,
then prithee my charmer be kind,
for while i love thou above measure,
to number i will never be confine.
count the bee that on Hybla be play,
count the flower that enamel its field,
count the flock that on Tempe be stray,
or the grain that rich Sicily yield;
go number the star in the heaven,
count how many sand on the shore,
when so many kiss you have give
i still shall be crave for more.
to a heart full of love let i hold thou,
to a heart which, dear Chloe, be thy;
with my arm i will for ever enfold thou,
and twist round thy limb like a vine.
what joy can be great than this be?
my life on thy lip shall be spend;
but the wretch that can number his kiss
with few will be ever content.
