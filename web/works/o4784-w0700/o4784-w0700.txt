Moral SONG. 

WOuld we attain the happiest State,
 That is design'd us here;
 No Joy a Rapture must create,
 No Grief beget Despair. 
No Injury fierce Anger raise,
 No Honour tempt to Pride;
 No vain Desires of empty Praise
 Must in the Soul abide. 
No Charms of Youth, or Beauty move
 The constant, settl'd Breast:
 Who leaves a Passage free to Love,
 Shall let in, all the rest. 
In such a Heart soft Peace will live,
 Where none of these abound;
 The greatest Blessing, Heav'n do's give,
 Or can on Earth be found.
