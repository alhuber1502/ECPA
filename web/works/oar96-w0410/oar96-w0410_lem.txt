paraphrase on canticle, 7. 11. 

i

come thou most charm object of my love,
 what be all this dull society to we,
 let we to the peaceful shade and spring remove,
 i be here uneasy though i linger thus. 

ii.

what be the trifle that i leave behind,
 i have more then all the value world in thou,
 where all my joy and wish be confine,
 thou be day and life and heaven it self to i. 

iii.

come my belove then let we away,
 to those bless seat where we will our flame improve,
 with how much heat shall i caress thou there,
 and in sweet transport give up all my love.
