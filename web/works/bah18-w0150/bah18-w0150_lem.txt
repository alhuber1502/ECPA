to the memory of a lovely infant,

write seven year after his death.

still as the circle month successive climb,
 with linger footstep, up the steep of time,
 bleak February frown in his return,
 and crown with cypress a sepulchral urn. 
for i he still a mournful aspect wear,
 and still receive the tribute of my tear. 
be not the ill enough which time supply,
 to check the dawn comfort in their rise? 
must memory too the present evil aid,
 and tinge with dark hue life be deepen shade? 
must woe on woe accumulate roll,
 and cloud with care the sunshine of the soul? 
such be our wretched lot, ill-fated kind! 
our thread of life with misery entwine;
 capricious fortune sport, or passion slave;
 till peace take root, and blossom on the grave. 
can i forget the day of anxious pain,
 when that dear angel form i watch in vain? 
can i forget the agonize hour
 when those love eye be close, to wake no more? 
ah, no! revolve year in vain depart,
 the trace still remain upon my heart! 

when lose in grief, my eye refuse a tear,
 instinctive fondness seek his silent bier,
 hope whisper, 'sure he sleep,' i wild press
 the lovely image to my ache breast,
 and feel the fearful chill of nature awful rest. 
now i can weep, and oft in thought recall
 the close scene, the coffin, and the pall. 
the solemn knell of death, i hear it toll;
 how heavy it strike my wound soul! 

it be long since past; forgetfulness have spread
 her misty mantle over unnumbered dead;
 but fond affection linger in the gloom;
 near the dim lamp that glimmer over the tomb
 she grave with tremble hand the mournful rhyme,
 where memory recall depart time,
 bring back in one short hour the dream of year,
 and sprinkle on the grave a mother tear.
