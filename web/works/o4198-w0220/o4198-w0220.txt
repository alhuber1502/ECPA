A BURLESQUE CANTATA.

1770.

RECIT.

MOUNTED aloft in Bristols narrow Streets,
 Where Pride and Luxury with meanness meets,
 A sturdy Collier prest the empty sack,
 A troop of thousands swarming on his back;
 When sudden to his rapt extatic view
 Rose the brown beauties of his red-hair'd Sue. 
Music spontaneously echoed from his tongue,
 And thus the Lover rather bawl'd, than sung. 

AIR.

Zaunds! Prithee pretty Zue is it thee,
 Odzookers I mun have a kiss. 
A Sweetheart should always be free,
 I whope you wunt take it amiss. 

Thy peepers are blacker than a caul,
 Thy carcase is sound as a sack,
 Thy visage is whiter than ball,
 Odzookers I mun have smack. 

RECIT.

The swain descending, in his raptured arms
 Held fast the Goddess, and despoil'd her charms. 
Whilst lock'd in Cupid's amorous embrace,
 His jetty skinnis met her red bronz'd face;
 It seem'd the sun when labouring in eclipse. 
And on her nose he stampt his sable lips,
 Pleas'd â€”.
