[cantata. dell METASTAISO.]

translation. 

dark, mournful cloud hang over the sun,
 light gleam portentous in the air,
 and yet who know? this trouble heart
 still give not up to blank despair. 

not big with shipwreck every storm,
 that sweep the bosom of the main,
 nor do the threaten, turbid sky,
 always the thunderbolt contain.
