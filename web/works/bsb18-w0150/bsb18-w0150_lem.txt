write on a gloomy day, in sickness.

THACKWOOD, 4th June, 1786. 

the gloomy lower of the sky,
 the milky softness of the air,
 the hum of many a busy fly,
 be thing the cheerful well can spare;
 but, to the pensive, thoughtful mind,
 those kindred gloom be true dear,
 when in dark shade such wood-note wind
 as woo and win reflection ear; —
 the bird that warble over head,
 the bee that visit every flower,
 the stream that murmur over its bed,
 all aid the melancholy hour. 
add to this, the waste frame,
 through which life pulse slow beat,
 will fain persuade that nought the same
 as when health glow with genial heat. 
where be the spirit, light as air,
 that self-amused, will carol loud? 
will find out pleasure everywhere,
 and all her path with garland strow? 
nature the same: the spring return,
 the leaf again adorn the tree;
 how tasteless this to she who mourn —
 to she who droop and fade like i! 
no emblem for myself i find,
 save what some die plant bestow —
 save where its droop head i bind,
 and mark how strong the likeness grow. 
no more sweet eve with drop distil
 shall melt over thou in tender grief;
 nor bid aurora cup be fill
 with balmy dew from yonder leaf. 
what, though some season more have roll
 their golden sun to glad thy eye! 
yet as a flower of mortal mould
 it be still thy lot — to bloom and die.
