song.

ask not, whence spring my ceaseless sadness,
 but let i still the secret keep:
 ask not, why thus in restless madness
 pass the long hour once give to sleep:

and strive not thus my look to read: .... 
for it be by certain fate decree,
 the cause that bid i rove forlorn,
 if know, will only move thy scorn,
 and make with anger lightning shine
 those now soft-smiling eye of thy. 

but know, when i no more behold thou,
 and to distant scene remove;
 shall ever a mournful tale be tell thou,
 of a youth who die for love,

who, though unknown to rank and fame,
 dare to admire a highborn dame;
 but, still averse to wound her pride,
 sad silence keep, and pine, and die: .... 
my likeness in that victim see,
 and pity he thou will pity i.
