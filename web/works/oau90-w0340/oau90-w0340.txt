A Letter Written for a LADY in Answer to a Friend.

HAd you not known your Merit was so great.
That my Laurinda I could ne'er forget;
Dulness, you might have want of Friendship thought.
And my neglect in writing call a Fault:
But though I want your Genius to express,
Believe me, dearest Friend, my Love's not less;
I would accost your Muse with equal Skill,
For though I want the Wit, I have the Will,
Did not my Reason whisper like a friend,
That I should wrong my self, should I pretend;
But for my friendship I must boldly own
'Tis firm and Constant, and shall stoop to none;
Nor is my Heart (which you I thought had known)
So chang'd or frozen since I came to Town;
That it by any Object could be mov'd
To slight my dear Laurinda whom I lov'd:
Alas, sweet friend, you know not our distress,
You never dream upon our Grievances;
Though pestilential Blasts all round us blow,
And many a beauteous darling face undo:
Though Bells do toll, and all to fears encline;
Fears, that would spoil a better Muse than mine,
You careless in the Silver Grove are seen,
(I wish for your sake I could call it Green)
Courting the Places Genius to inspire,
And strength of Fancy warms instead of Fire;
But I benumb'd with all this Frost and Snow,
Begin now to believe my Muse is so.
I like a Linnet, wishing for the Spring,
(Linnet I say) because I learn to sing;
Hop up and down all day my lonely Cage,
And find that Cold's as bad as fumbling Age,
Nothing can stir up my Poetick Rage;
My Verses dare not yet their worth expose,
For well their Feet may halt when they are froze;
But when the Summer cloaths the naked Trees,
And Balmy Winds refresh with gentle breeze:
When Flowers their gay Wedding Robes put on,
To please and welcome in the vigorous Sun;
Then Silvia sitting by Laurinda's side,
Shall prove this Truth, and shall not be deny'd,
That none on Earth can e'er more faithful be,
Or her dear Friend can value more than she.
