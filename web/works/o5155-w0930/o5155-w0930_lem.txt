 i 

in a vale fringe with woodland, where grotto abound,
and rivulet murmur, and echo resound,
i vow to the muse my time and my care;
since neither can win i the smile of my fair.

as freedom inspire i, i range and i sing;
and daphne dear name never fall from my tongue
and if once a smooth accent delight my ear,
i shall wish, unaware, that my Daphne may hear

with fair idea my bosom i store;
allusion to none but the nymph i adore;
and the more i with study my fancy refine,
the deep impression she make on my mind.

ah! while i the beauty of nature pursue,
i still must my daphne fair image renew:
the grace have choose with Daphne to rove,
and the muse be all in alliance with love.
