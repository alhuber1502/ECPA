to Flavia,

a ode.

i 

if Flavia in thy faultless form
 all that be heavenly-fair we find,
 if every grace conspire to charm,
 and speak the beauty of thy mind. 

ii.

why shall thou wonder, lovely maid,
 at the soft passion you inspire? 
why those to hopeless love betray,
 or these feel friendship sacred fire? 

iii.

heedless thy charm eye enslave,
 nor know the smile death they dart;
 nought can the wretched gazer save,
 or rescue his devote heart. 

iv.

but ah to win the soul be more,
 and friendship noble fire impart,
 the work of some divine power,
 and reason wing the unerring dart. 

v. 

let thy adorer just praise
 the wondrous beauty of thy face,
 extol thy charm a thousand way,
 and with thy name their number grace. 

vi.

friendship a noble theme shall find,
 and to the admire world display,
 the grace that adorn thy mind,
 a subject that will never decay. 

vii.

when thy bright eye shall cease to wound,
 and age thy fade charm embrace;
 when in thy look no trace be find,
 of what the lovely Flavia be. 

viii.

the last beauty of thy mind,
 the muse in gentle strain shall sing,
 in thy fair soul new charm shall find,
 to raise her voice, and prune her wing.
