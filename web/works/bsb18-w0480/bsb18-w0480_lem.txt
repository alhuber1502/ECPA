what ail this heart of mine!

what ail this heart of i? 
what ail this watery thou? 
what gar i all turn cauld as death
 when i take leave of thou? 
when thou be far away
 thou will dear grow to i;
 but change of place and change of folk
 may gar thy fancy jee. 

when i gae out at een,
 or walk at morning air,
 ilk rustle bush will seem to say
 i use to meet thou there. 
then i will sit down and cry,
 and live aneath the tree,
 and when a leaf fa's in my lap
 i will cae a word from thou. 

i will hie i to the bower
 that thou with rose tie,
 and where with money a blush bud
 i strive myself to hide. 
i will dote on ilk spot
 where i have be with thou;
 and call to mind some kindly word
 by ilk burn and tree! 

with such thought in my mind,
 time through the world may gae,
 and find my heart in twenty year
 the same as it be today. 
it be thought that bind the soul,
 and keep friend in the thou;
 and gin i think i see thou aye,
 what can part thou and i!
