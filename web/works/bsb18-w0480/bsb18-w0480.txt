WHAT AILS THIS HEART O' MINE!

WHAT ails this heart o' mine? 
What ails this watery ee? 
What gars me a' turn cauld as death
 When I take leave o' thee? 
When thou art far awa
 Thou'lt dearer grow to me;
 But change o' place and change o' folk
 May gar thy fancy jee. 

When I gae out at een,
 Or walk at morning air,
 Ilk rustling bush will seem to say
 I us'd to meet thee there. 
Then I'll sit down and cry,
 And live aneath the tree,
 And when a leaf fa's i' my lap
 I'll ca't a word frae thee. 

I'll hie me to the bower
 That thou wi' roses tied,
 And where wi' mony a blushing bud
 I strove mysell to hide. 
I'll doat on ilka spot
 Where I hae been wi' thee;
 And ca' to mind some kindly word
 By ilka burn and tree! 

Wi' sic thoughts i' my mind,
 Time through the world may gae,
 And find my heart in twenty years
 The same as 'tis to-day. 
'Tis thoughts that bind the soul,
 And keep friends i' the ee;
 And gin I think I see thee aye,
 What can part thee and me!
