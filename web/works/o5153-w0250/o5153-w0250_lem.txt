to the same. 

your shape, your lip, your eye be still the same,
still the bright object of my constant flame;
but where be now the tender glance, that steal
with gentle sweetness my enchant soul?
kind fear, impatient wish, soft desire,
each melt charm that love alone inspire,
these, these be lose; and i behold no more
the maid, my heart delight to adore.
yet still unchanged, still dote to excess,
i ought but dare not try to love you less;
weak i grieve, unpitied i complain;
but not unpunished shall your change remain;
for you, cold maid, who no complaint can move,
be far more bless, when you like i can love.
