It appears from</span> WHITLOCK, <span class="hi">that he was a man of great consideration in the army, and with the public. </span>Oliver Cromwell <span class="hi">served under him — the</span> KING <span class="hi">feared him — the</span> PARLIAMENT <span class="hi">depended on him. </span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e48600">[Page 98]</span><p><span class="hi">The purity of his intentions, and the uprightnes<span class="gap" title="illegible">•</span>of his principles — the transcript before you wil<span class="gap" title="illegible">•</span>sufficiently establish; — it is a</span> mental mirror, <span class="hi">in which you behold the features of the writer's mind, as distinctly as a looking glass reflects, to a young beauty, her cheek of roses, and her eye of fire. That he was popular as to courage and resolution, is plain from a formal petition sent to Parliament by the inhabitants of Portsmouth, praying that</span> Sir William Waller <span class="hi">might be made their Governor. </span></p><p><span class="hi">That he had a mind capable of the tenderest impressions, and alive to all the charms of love, appears, from this, that he never lived unmarried. Three times he exulted in the flowery hymeneal chain; and speaks of each Lady with exalted fondness and affection. But those, alas! were days in which the</span> connubial passion <span class="hi">was the only one tolerated! </span></p><p><span class="hi">Of</span> WALLER, Hume <span class="hi">begins to speak in the following words: —</span><span class="q"> "<span class="hi">In the year</span> 1643, Sir William Waller <span class="hi">began to distinguish himself among the Generals of the army. Active, and indesatigable; in his operations rapid and enterprising; he was fitted by his genius to the nature of war.</span>"</span>Vol. VI. p. 516.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e49324">[Page 99]</span><p><span class="hi">It has been lately so much the taste to read the ana of celebrated men, that the Editor of</span> these <span class="hi">is persuaded, their being combined with the effusions of her own idle hours, will not render them unwelcome. To the public, perhaps, there is no occasion for apology, but towards the writer himself, she has some consciousness of delinquency. The brave General, who wore himself out in campaigns, cased in armour, and peeping half his life through an iron vizor, thought of nothing</span> less, <span class="hi">probably, than of turning author; — yet it happens, that after he has been at rest with his tumultuous ancestors (I hope they will forgive my guessing at their characters) almost a century, and his military and moral character long ago decided on, he is now made to hold up his hand at the literary bar, to be tried by his Critics, and his Country. </span></p><p><span class="hi">To his critics and countrymen, it may be observed, that if they have an appetite for anecdote, the following pages will not tend much to satisfy it. They are filled with the recollections of a man, who, at the close of a busy life, thought it</span> time <span class="hi">to recollect himself, and who recollects</span> only <span class="hi">about himself. In the retrospect, his imminent dangers, and hairbreadth 'scapes, light up his gratitude to Heaven, and make his little book rather a compendium of piety, than a register of events. A piety not much</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e50178">[Page 100]</span> <span class="hi">differing from that which has provoked our sneers at the posthumous works of the great</span> Johnson; <span class="hi">— but then,</span> he <span class="hi">was a scholar, and a philosopher, and his piety, in course, very much unlike other people's. What you are now offer'd, is the piety of a General — we have many Generals, and they can answer for the similitude. </span></p><p><span class="hi">In a word — this peculiar little volume is presented not to the world as an amusement, but to the</span> curious <span class="hi">as a</span> medal. <span class="hi">A medal struck at an era when the events of this country were</span> MIGHTY, <span class="hi">and when the characters of men were</span> GRAND: <span class="hi">when every action was on an enlarged scale, and in high relief; — when the kingdom, like Sir Joshua's infant Hercules, was struggling between the two deadly serpents which assailed its vitality — the</span> TYRANNY OF THE COMMONWEALTH, <span class="hi">and the</span> PREROGATIVE OF THE CROWN.</p><p><span class="hi">The</span> internal evidence <span class="hi">the book carries with it is so strong, that it is judged not necessary to say one word on its authenticity. But it is necessary to say, that besides the pages suppressed (mentioned in the conclusion), there has been an elision of one entire section, under the head</span> OF PERILS BY WATER; <span class="hi">a part likewise of that under the head</span> BY GREAT SICKNESSES, <span class="hi">has been cut out, because the circumstances</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e50970">[Page 101]</span> <span class="hi">mentioned, and the terms used, are not exactly correspondent to the ideas of delicacy, which happily, is in this age one of its characteristics. </span></p><p><span class="hi">In the opening of the manuscript, there appears to be two leaves wanting; whether what is lost contained events or reflections, it is impossible to judge — the leaves are not torn, but cut out carefully with a knife, close to the margin. The beginning of the third leaf, is the end of a reflection, of which</span> itt, <span class="hi">is the first word. For further information the reader shall be now left to Sir William himself, and it is hoped he will not rank the half hour spent in his society, amongst the most unprofitable half hours of his life. </span></p></section></div><li><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-33" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-33">RECOLLECTIONS, BY GENERAL SIR WILLIAM WALLER.</a></li><div class="collapse" id="collapse-33"><section class="memorial" id="index.xml-body.1_div.10"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e51410">[Page]</span><header><h1><span class="head">RECOLLECTIONS, <span class="show"></span><span class="show"></span>BY GENERAL SIR WILLIAM WALLER.</span></h1></header><p>itt, but a stormy sea?

I have been</p><p>IN PRISONS FREQUENT,</p><p>Seissed upon by the army, as I was going to discharge my duty in the House of Commons, and, contrary to priviledg of Parliament, made a prisoner in the Queen's court; from thence carried ignominiously to a place under the Exchequer called Hell, and the next day to the King's Head in the Strand; after, singled out (as a sheep to the slaughter) and removed to St. James's: thence sent to Windsor Castle, and remanded to St. James's againe; lastly tossed, like a ball into a strange country, to Denbigh Castle in North Wales, remote from, my relations and interests. — After above three yeares imprisonment, and thus being changed as itt were from vessel to vessel, itt pleased the Lord to turne my captivity, and to restore me to the comforts of my poore family againe; and here let me call to mind how much reason I had to be thankfull to him, who chasteneth those whom he loveth, for the great consolation experienced in the dear partner of my captivity.

Much difficulty had she in comming, and was frequent on the brink of being discovered; but att length over mountains and unknown roads, sometimes with a guide, and sometimes with none, she arrived att my prison: and she seemed when she discovered herself to me, to be like the Angell who appeared unto Peter in like circumstances: she did not indeed bid my prison gates fly open, but by her sweet converse and behaviour, she made those things seem light, which were before heavy, and scarce to be borne. — I must ever acknowledg itt also a very great mercy, that being so long subject to so great a <span class="hi">malice,</span> armed with so great a <span class="hi">power,</span> I was not given as a prey to their teeth; and that after all the indeavours that were used to finde out matter of charge against me, I came off with an entire innocency, not only uncondemned, but unaccused.</p><p>The 5th of August, 1659, I was seized a prisoner by a party of horse in Kent, and the 22d following I was committed to the Tower, only upon jealousy; and, because I refused to inform the councell further than in what singly concerned my self, and because I denyed to give any ingagement.

My deare wife (the Lady Ann) had a deliverance of the very same kinde there likewise; having been to look att an ould staircase which was repairing, she was no sooner gon, but the place where she stood fell, and<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e54265">[Page 107]</span> in humane reason, she could not but have perished in the ruines. —</p><p>Att Cropredy in Oxfordshire, I escaped a great danger of the like nature, when being with my officers att a councell of warr, the floore of the roome (where I was) sunke under me, and I lay overwhelmed with a great deal of lumber that fell upon me, and yet, blessed be God, I had no hurt att all. And att this place I did likewise escape a snare. After the battell, a message was sent to me by the King; when I had given my answer <span class="hi">that I could not treat with his Majesty but by command of Parliament,</span> I turned shortly round; when the trumpet said he had a <span class="hi">private</span> mesage for me, and praied me to hear him: I replyed there need be no privacy, not caring to give an handle to mine Enemies: but some that were neare me did persuade me to heare the man, and went out. He then presently pulled forth a letter, which to my great shame and surprise came from the Lady ******; in itt she besought me to betray my cause; and this she did so wittily and kinde, that I had much ado to be angry. Before this lady's marriage I had been her suitor, and did dearly love her, and she remembered me of this, and of some soft passages. Whether or not she was putt on this by some greater than herself, I never knew; but I returned for answer, that as I had<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e55171">[Page 108]</span> never been traitor to my love, so would I not to my cause, which I should be, if I did as she would advise, and after this I heard no more. —</p><p>2. BY GREAT SICKNESSES. —</p><p>I had a great deliverance from the plague att my house in Aldersgate-street, a chambermaid of my wifes being struck with itt (who died within a day or two after att the pesthouse, whither she was removed) my wife being then great with child (of my son Thomas) had her by the hand in her sickness, and was neare her, when she was in sweats, yet neither she nor any of my family, were infected.</p><p>Att Calais I escaped the plague, when Sir Philip Stapleton died of itt, and I was with him and had him by the hand, not above five or six howers before he departed.</p><p>3.

Nevertheless itt pleased God in his infinit mercy to direct the rest of my troopes to me, and under the conduct of his providence, I made a safe and an honorable retreat to Gloucester, in despight of the enemy who charged me in the reare, but with more loss to him, than to me.</p><p>Att Landsdown, when I made the retreat, I escaped a shower of shott.</p><p>At the Devises, when I beat the Lord Marquess Harford, Prince Maurice, and the Lord Hopton, with their remaining forces into the town, the second night after I sat down before itt, having been out to visit the gardes, and returning to a farmhouse (at the foot of Roundway Down) where I had given order to my cooke, that my supper should be ready against I came in, and finding my meat but newly laid to the fire; in a suddain impatience I resolved<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e57437">[Page 111]</span> not to supp att all, and so tooke horse again, and rode upp to the topp, where the body of my horse lay. I was not gon above a muskett shott, but some of the ennemy (knowing the pasages thereabout, which I did not; and rationally supposing I might quarter in that place; in regard of the convenient situation of itt, between my horse and my foot) came into the house and enquired, and made a search for me, and if I had staied there (as at first I intended) in all probability they might have suddainly dispatched me, and retired in the darkness of night, with safety enough.</p><p>Some dayes after, whilst I lay before the town, I rode with a small party about the quarters, particularly to see how the dragoones were laid, on the further side of the town; and being to returne back, itt pleased God to putt itt suddainly into my minde, to go by another way than that I came, which some of the party, and some of mine own servants (who staid a little behind) not observing, but taking the former way, they were almost all taken by the ennemy. I came back safely.</p><p>Att Farnham God appeared wonderfully for me, when the Lord Hopton, drew upp his whole army within culverin shott of me, being (with the forces of Sir Jacob Ashly, who was then joined to him)<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e58282">[Page 112]</span> att the least eight thousand horse and foot; and (thorough the mistake or neglect of my adiutant-generall, and the slackness of my men, in drawing to the rendevous) I was not able to face him with two thousand men. In that extremity the Lord tooke opportunity to shew himself for me, and sent so thick a mist all the morning, that by reason of the darkness the ennemy durst not give on, and when the mist brake upp, I had such an advantage of the ground, that my weakness remained undiscovered, and he drew off from me, I was that day delivred from an imminent destruction.</p><p>Att Cheriton Field, I was in danger to have been taken or killed, the ennemy having by a charge given upon some troopes of mine, shutt me off from mine own men, I having then but three with me; but itt pleased God they were repulsed againe, and thereby a way opened for my retreat.</p><p>I may reckon itt a mercy, that upon a suddain occasion that day, charging without my headpeece, and being known by the ennemy (as I afterwards understood) I came off safe and unhurt.</p><p>When the King came suddainly upon me with his whole army att Andover, and I had then nothing<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e59023">[Page 113]</span> but a body of horse and dragoones with me, I made a fair retreat to Basingstoke.</p><p>Att the second Newbery fight, when I fell on with my troopes by the way off Speenfield, and wee were mingled with the ennemy, I had a great deliverence, for one of the adverse party coming behinde me, and being ready to fire his pistoll in my reines; in that instant one of my life guard killed him, or otherwise in all probability he had killed me.</p><p><span class="q"> "<span class="hi">O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation: thou hast covered my head in the day off battell.</span>"</span>Ps. cxl. 7.</p><p><span class="q"> "<span class="hi">The Angell of the Lord, encampeth round about them that feare him, and delivereth them.</span>"</span>Ps. xxxiv. 7.</p><p>IN JOURNYINGS OFT.</p><p>In my travell between Venice and Florence, I escaped the danger of the Inquisition att Bolonia, where through the information of a priest (that came along in company with me from Venice) I was searched, my trunke, wherein I had nothing but clothes, was rifled to the bottome, but itt pleased God to so order itt, that they lett alone a box, wherein I had some papers, which might have exposed<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e59725">[Page 114]</span> me to question; when they had itt in their hands ready to open itt.</p><p>In my journey into Yorkeshire, to my Sisters house at Hickleton, (being accompanied with my wife the Lady Ann, and my dear mother) I reckon itt a great deliverance, that when my coach mares, upon the descent of an hill, had broken their raines, and overthrown the coachman from the box, and begun to run away, the raines falling down upon the ground, one of the mares, treading upon them, they checked her bitt, and made her stopp, which made the rest stand like-wise.</p><p>IN PERILLS IN THE CITTY.</p><p>When the army first marcht up to the citty of London, and made that breach upon the Parliament, I was voted to command a body of horse and dragoones, in the nature of a flying army, for the defence of the King, Kingdome, Parliament, and Citty; and whilst I was acting (with others) according to my duty, at the Committee of Militia, to advance that levy; wee were all unexpectedly deserted and betraied by the citty and left out of all capitulation; so that upon the entring of the army, we were<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e60428">[Page 115]</span> inforced to lye hidd, and within a few dayes after to make use of the passes which the House of Commons had given us, and to quit the kingdome.

But itt pleased the wisdome of God to befoole their malice, that they made no search in mine own house, where all that I had of vallue was, but only in that place, where there was nothing but so inconsiderable a parcell of plate, that they were ashamed<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e61221">[Page 116]</span> to keep itt, when they had itt; and so they sent itt back again.

To which I returned no more, but that I should have no more to do in that business, and so I left them. This was all that passed, and yet those false impudent creatures made their report att the army, that I abetted that disorder and assault upon the House, and cooperated with the apprentices in itt, which served to exasperate the army so much the more against me.

But itt pleased God to prevent the effect of his treachery, both by giving me the confidence to stand upon mine own innocency, and by discovering to me, that that perfidious man (in the middest of all his protestations of friendshipp to me), had privately offered himself to give evidence against me att the barr of the House of Commons; so that it was a meere train, laid to bring a guiltiness upon me, and to take away my life.</p><p>The like offer was made to my wife in reference to the procurement of my escape out of Windsor Castle, by one Captain Kempe of Collonell Prides<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e63608">[Page 119]</span> regiment, with the addition of an intended cheat; but I was delivered as a bird, out of the snare of these fowlers, so that I was not catcht with their chaff. —</p><p>About the same time, shortly after my coming to Windsor Castle, having opportunity to send to my deare wife (whom I had left in a disconsolat condition att London, great with child, and within a few weeks of her delivery) as I had sealed my letter and was ready to dispatch itt away, I had notice given me by my keeper, that the Governour must see whatever letters I wrote or received; whereupon I bad him carry itt unto him, that he might open it if he thought fitt: But the Governour returned itt back unto me untouched, with this compliment, that I was very much mistaken in him if I thought he would be so unworthy, as to open letters between a man and his wife; and with some further expressions of respect to me, in regard, he had formerly served as a Lieutenant Colonell under me. This I tooke as a civility from him, but I found it after to be no other than a meere insiduous practise; for after an uninterrupted pasage of letters between my wife and me, for about a fortnight or three weekes, by which time he supposed, wee might be grown to a confidence to write freely, he suddainly seised upon all my letters. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e64454">[Page 120]</span>But there was nothing to be found in them that could prejudice me, and so that snare likewise broke, and I escaped the danger of it. <span class="hi">Blessed be God. </span></p><p>March 1654.

Walking out northward of the citty, soon after her laying in, she stopped att the cottage of a poore woman whom she heard making doleful cries. She sent one of her train to know what itt might be which occasioned itt; the page returned and said the woman was sorrowing grievously, because her daughter had been two days in the strawe, and was almost dead for want of nourishment, she having nothing to give her but water, and not being able for the hardness of the times to gett any thing. On this the Queen tooke a small chain of gould from her neck att which hung an agnus; she tooke off the agnus and putt itt in her bosom, and making the woman be called to her, gave her the chain and bad her to go into the citty to a gouldsmith and sell itt, and keepe the money to provide for the good woman in the strawe. And for this her confessor did afterward rebuke her, because they were hereticks: when this thing was told to the King, he asked, jestingly, if her Confessor had made the Queen do a penance for itt; as she haddon once before, for some innocent act, when she was made to walke to Tyburn, some say barefoot.</p><p>10.

My dismal defeat att Roundway Down was owing to those heart burnings and jealoucies; for the General suffered the enemies horse to pass quietly, and without molestation, to the succour of their infantry which lay att the Devizes in miserable plight. <span class="hi">The proud have laid snares for me,</span> saith the Psalmist, <span class="hi">and sett traps in my way. </span>So sure was I of victory that I wrote to Parliament to bid them be att rest, for that I would shortly send them an account of<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d50896e66980">[Page 124]</span> the numbers taken and the numbers slaine, but it pleas'd the Lord to turn my victory into mourning, and my glory into shame: with a small number of cavalry I retired to Bristol, and there heard continually of the successes of the royal party; who took heart on this mischance of mine, that had never happened had others don their duty.</p><p>15.

A notable instance was his discovering in one short conversation with one Captain Giles (a great favorite with the Lord Generall, and whome he most confided in), that although his words were full of zeal, and his actions seemingly brave, that his heart was not with the cause: and in fine, this man did shortly after join the enemy at Oxford, with three and twenty stout fellowes.
