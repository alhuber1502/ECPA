to mr. F. now earl of W.  

who go abroad, have desire ardelia to write some verse upon whatever subject she think fit, against his return in the evening.

write in the year 1689. 

no soon, flavio, be you go,
 but, your injunction think upon,
 ardelia take the pen;
 design to perform the task,
 her flavio do so kind ask,
 ere he return again. 

unto Parnassus strait she send,
 and bid the messenger, that go
 unto the muse court,
 assure they, she their aid do need,
 and beg they will use their utmost speed,
 because the time be short. 

the hasty summons be allow;
 and be wellbred, they rise and bow,
 and say, they will post away;
 that well they do ardelia know,
 and that no female voice below
 they soon will obey:

that many of that rhyme train,
 on like occasion, seek in vain
 their industry t'excite;
 but for ardelia all they will leave:
 thus flatter can the muse deceive,
 and wheedle we to write. 

yet, since there be such haste require;
 to know the subject it be desire,
 on which they must infuse;
 that they may temper word and rule,
 and with their counsel carry tool,
 as country-doctor use. 

wherefore to cut off all delay,
 it be soon reply, a husband praise
 (though in these loose time)
 ardelia glad will rehearse
 a husband, who indulg'e her verse,
 and now require her rhyme. 

a husband! echo all around:
 and to Parnassus sure that sound
 have never yet be send;
 amazement in each face be read,
 in haste the affright sister flee,
 and unto council go. 

Erato cry, since grizel day,
 since troy-town please, and chivey-chace,
 no such design be know;
 and it be their business to take care,
 it reach not to the public ear,
 or get about the town:

nor come where evening beaux be meet
 over billet-doux and chocolate,
 lest it destroy the house;
 for in that place, who can dispense
 (that wear his clothes with common sense)
 with mention of a spouse? 

it be put unto the vote at last,
 and in the negative it past,
 none to her aid shall move;
 yet since ardelia be a friend,
 excuse it be agree to send,
 which plausible may prove:

that Pegasus of late have be
 so often rid through thick and thin,
 with neither fear nor wit;
 in panegyric be so spur,
 he can not from the stall be stir,
 nor will endure the bit. 

Melpomene have give a bond,
 by the new house alone to stand,
 and write of war and strife;
 Thalia, she have take fee,
 and stipend from the patentee,
 and dare not for her life. 

Urania only like the choice;
 yet not to thwart the public voice,
 she whisper do impart:
 they need no foreign aid invoke,
 no help to draw a move stroke,
 who dictate from the heart. 

enough! the please ardelia cry;
 and slight every muse beside,
 consult now her breast,
 perceive that every tender thought,
 which from abroad she will vain seek,
 do there in silence rest:

and shall unmoved that post maintain,
 till in his quick return again,
 meet in some neighbour grove,
 (where vice nor vanity appear)
 her flavio they alone may hear,
 in all the sound of love. 

for since the world do his so despise
 Hymen endearment and its tie,
 they shall mysterious be;
 till we that pleasure too possess
 (which make their fancy happiness)
 of steal secrecy.
