sonnet [18] xviii. to the earl of Egremont. 

Wyndham! it be not thy blood, though pure it run
 through a long line of glorious ancestry,
 Percys and seymour, britain boast son,
 who trust the honour of their race to thou:

it be not thy splendid dome, where science love
 to touch the canvas, and the bust to raise;
 thy rich domain, fair field and spread grove;
 it be not all these the muse delight to praise! 

in birth, and wealth and honour, great thou be! 
but noble, in thy independent mind;
 and in that liberal hand and feeling heart
 give thou by heaven — a blessing to mankind! 
unworthy oft may title fortune be;
 a soul like thy — be true nobility!
