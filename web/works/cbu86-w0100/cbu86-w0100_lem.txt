the vision.

duan first. 

the sun have close the winter-day,
 the curler quat their roar play,
 and hunger maulkin take her way
 to kail-yard green,
 while faithless snaw ilk step betray
 whare she have be. 

the thresher weary flingin-tree,
 the lee-long day have tire i;
 and when the day have close his e'e,
 far in the west,
 ben in the spence, right pensive,
 i go to rest. 

there, lonely, by the ingle-cheek,
 i sit and eye the spew reek,
 that fill, with host-provoking smeek,
 the old, clay biggin;
 and hear the restless ratton squeak
 about the riggin. 

all in this motty, misty clime,
 i backward muse on waste time,
 how i have spend my youthful prime,
 and do nothing,
 but string blether up in rhyme
 for fool to sing. 

have i to guide advice but harket,
 i may, by this, have lead a market,
 or strut in a bank and clarket
 my cash-account;
 while here, half-mad, half-fed, half-sarket,
 be all the amount. 

i start, mutter blockhead! coof! 
and heave on high my wauket loof,
 to swear by all yond starry roof,
 or some rash aith,
 that i, henceforth, will be rhyme-proof
 till my last breath —

when click! the string the snick do draw;
 and jee! the door go to the wall;
 and by my ingle-lowe i see,
 now bleezan bright,
 a tight, outlandish Hizzie, braw,
 come full in fight. 

you need not doubt, i hold my whisht;
 the infant aith, half-formed, be crush;
 i glower as eerie i will be dusht,
 in some wild glen;
 when sweet, like modest worth, she blush,
 and step be. 

green, slender, leaf-clad holly-bough
 be twist, graceful, round her brow,
 i take she for some scottish Muse,
 by that same token;
 and come to stop those reckless vow,
 will soon be break. 

a "hare-brained, sentimental trace"
 be strong mark in her face;
 a wildly-witty, rustic grace
 shine full upon she;
 her eye, even turn on empty space,
 beam keen with honour. 

down flow her robe, a tartan sheen,
 till half a leg be scrimp see;
 and such a leg! my Bess, i ween,
 can only peer it;
 sae straught, so taper, tight and clean,
 none else come near it. 

her mantle large, of greenish hue,
 my gaze wonder chief draw;
 deep light and shade, bold-mingling, throw
 a lustre grand;
 and seem, to my astonish view,
 a wellknown land. 

here, river in the sea be lose;
 there, mountain to the sky be toss:
 here, tumble billow mark the coast,
 with surge foam;
 there, distant shine, art lofty boast,
 the lordly dome. 

here, Doon pour down his far-fetched flood;
 there, well-fed Irwine stately thud:
 old, hermit aire staw through his wood,
 on to the shore;
 and many a less torrent scud,
 with seem roar. 

low, in a sandy valley spread,
 a ancient borough rear her head;
 still, as in scottish story read,
 she boast a race,
 to every noble virtue breed,
 and polish grace. 

duan second.

with musing-deep, astonish stare,
 i view the heavenly-seeming fair;
 a whisper throb do witness bear
 of kindred sweet,
 when with a elder sister air
 she do i greet. 

 'all hail! my own inspire bard! 
' in i thy native muse regard! 
 'nor long mourn thy fate be hard,
' thus poor low! 
 'i come to give thou such reward,
' as we bestow. 

 'know, the great genius of this land,
' have many a light, aerial band,
 'who, all beneath his high command,
' harmonious,
 'as art or arm they understand,
' their labor ply. 

 'they scotia race among they share;
' some fire the sodger on to dare;
 'some rouse the patriot up to bare
' corruption heart:
 'some teach the bard, a darling care,
' the tuneful art. 

 'among swell flood of reek gore,
' they ardent, kindle spirit pour;
 'or, amid the venal senate roar,
' they, sightless, stand,
 'to mend the honest patriot-lore,
 'and grace the hand. 

 'hence, fullarton, the brave and young;
' hence, dempster truth-prevailing tongue;
 'hence, sweet harmonious Beattie sing
' he "minstrel lay;"
'or tear, with noble ardour sting,
' the sceptic's bay. 

'to lower order be assign,
 'the humble rank of humankind,
' the rustic bard, the labour hind,
 'the artisan;
' all choose, as, various they be incline,
 'the various man. 

 'when yellow wave the heavy grain,
' the threaten storm, some, strong, rein;
 'some teach to meliorate the plain,
' with tillage-skill;
 'and some instruct the shepherd-train,
' Blythe over the hill. 

 'some hint the lover harmless wile;
' some grace the maiden artless smile;
 'some soothe the labourer weary toil,
' for humble gain,
 'and make his cottage-scene beguile
' he care and pain. 

 'some, bound to a district-space,
' explore at large man infant race,
 'to mark the embryotic trace,
 'of rustic bard;
' and careful note each open grace,
 'a guide and guard. 

 'of these be i — COILA my name;
' and this district as i i claim,
 'where once the Campbell, chief of fame,
' hold rule power:
 'i mark thy embryo-tuneful flame,
' thy natal hour. 

 'with future hope, i oft will gaze,
' fond, on thy little, early way,
 'thy rudely-carolled, chime phrase,
' in uncouth rhyme,
 'fire at the simple, artless lay
' of other time. 

 'i see thou seek the sound shore,
' delight with the dash roar;
 'or when the north his fleecy store
' drive through the sky,
 'i see grim nature visage hoar,
' strike thy young eye. 

 'or when the deep-green-mantled earth,
' warm-cherished every floweret birth,
 'and joy and music pour forth,
' in every grove,
 'i see thou eye the general mirth
' with boundless love. 

 'when ripen field, and azure sky,
' call forth the reaper rustle noise,
 'i see thou leave their evening joy,
' and lonely stalk,
 'to vent thy bosom swell rise,
 'in pensive walk. 

 'when youthful love, warm-blushing, strong,
' keen-shivering shot thy nerve along,
 'those accent, grateful to thy tongue,
' the adore name,
 'i teach thou how to pour in song,
 'to soothe thy flame. 

 'i see thy pulse's madden play,
' wild-send thou pleasure devious way,
 'mislead by fancy meteor-ray,
' by passion drive;
 'but yet the light that lead astray,
' be light from heaven. 

 'i teach thy manners-painting strain,
' the love, the way of simple swain,
 'till now, over all my wide domain,
 'thy fame extend;
' and some, the pride of coila plain,
 'become thy friend. 

 'thou can not learn, nor i can show,
'to paint with Thomson landscape-glow;
' or wake the bosom-melting throe,
 'with shenstone art;
' or pour, with grey, the move flow,
 'warm on the heart. 

 'yet all beneath unrivalled rose,
' the lowly Daisy sweet blow;
 'though large the forest monarch throw
' his army shade,
 'yet green the juicy hawthorn grow,
' down the glade. 

 'then never murmur nor repine
' strive in thy humble sphere to shine;
 'and trust i, not potosi mine,
' nor king regard,
 'can give a bliss o'ermatch thy,
 'a rustic bard

'to give my counsel all in one,
 'thy tuneful flame still careful fan;
' preserve the dignity of man,
 'with soul erect;
' and trust, the universal plan
 'will all protect. 

 'and wear thou this' — she solemn say,
 and bind the holly round my head:
 the polish leaf, and berry red,
 do rustle play;
 and, like a pass thought, she flee,
 in light away.
