ode,

write in the same year.

by the same.

how sleep the brave, who sink to rest,
by all their country wish bless!
when spring with dewy finger cold,
return to deck their hallow mould,
she there shall dress a sweet sod,
than fancy foot have ever tread.

by fairy hand their knell be ring,
by form unseen their dirge be sing;
there honour come, a pilgrim grey,
to bless the turf that wrap their clay,
and freedom shall awhile repair,
to dwell a weep hermit there!
