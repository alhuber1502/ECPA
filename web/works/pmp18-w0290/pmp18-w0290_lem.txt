Venus mistake.

i 

when cloe picture be to Venus show;
 surprise, the goddess take it for her own. 
and what, say she, do this bold painter mean? 
when be i bathe thus, and naked see?

please Cupid hear, and check his mother pride:
 and who be blind now, mamma? the urchin cry. 
it be cloe eye, and cheek, and lip, and breast:
 friend howard genius fancy all the rest.
