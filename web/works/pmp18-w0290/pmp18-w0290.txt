VENUS Mistaken.

I.

When Cloe's Picture was to Venus shown;
 Surpriz'd, the Goddess took it for Her own. 
And what, said She, does this bold Painter mean? 
When was I Bathing thus, and Naked seen? 

II.

Pleas'd Cupid heard, and check'd His Mother's Pride:
 And who's blind now, Mamma? the Urchin cry'd. 
'Tis Cloe's Eye, and Cheek, and Lip, and Breast:
 Friend Howard's Genius fancy'd all the rest.
