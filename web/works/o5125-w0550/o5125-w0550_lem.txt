the death of Abel.

when from the shade of eden blissful bower,
 its fruit ambrosial and immortal flower,
 our general mother (who too soon rebel,)
 be, with the partner of her crime, expel
 to field less fruitful — where the rugged soil
 with thorn and thistle often pay their toil;
 where the pale flower soon lose their cheerful hue,
 and rush tempest over the mountain fly:
 two son the matron in her exile bear,
 unlike in feature but their nature more;
 the old youth for husbandry renowned,
 tear up the surface of the sterile ground;
 his nervous arm for rugged task be form;
 his cheek but seldom with a smile adorn;
 drop raise by labour down his temple run,
 his temple tarnish by the midday sun,
 robust of body, and of soul severe,
 unknown to pity, and the like to fear. 

not so his brother, cast in fair mould
 be he — and soft than his fleecy fold;
 fair be his cheek that blush with rosy dye,
 peace dwell for ever in his cheerful eye,
 nor guilt, nor rage his gentle spirit know;
 sweet be his slumber, for his care be few;
 those be to feed and watch the tender lamb,
 and seek fresh pasture for its bleat dam,
 from burn sun his thirsty flock to hide,
 and seek the vale where limpid river glide. 

it be ere rude hand have reap the wave grain,
 when plenty triumph on the fertile plain,
 that to the centre of a pleasant down,
 where half be pasture, half a plenteous brown:
 these youth repair both emulous of fame,
 and raise a altar to jehovah name,
 with heart elate and self-presuming eye,
 first to the pile unhappy Cain draw nigh. 
choice be his offer, yet no sign appear,
 no flame be see, nor voice celestial hear:
 astonish stand the late presumptuous man,
 then come his brother with a tremble lamb;
 his god accept the sacrifice sincere;
 the flame propitious round the slay appear;
 the curl smoke ascend to the sky:
 this Cain behold, and roll his glow eye. 
sting to the soul, he with his frantic hand
 a stone uproot from the yield sand,
 nor speak — for rage have stop his fail tongue;
 the heavy death impetuous whirl along:
 this Abel meet — his heart receive the wound;
 amaze he fall, and grasp the bloody ground. 
the gentle spirit spring to endless day,
 and leave behind her case of beauteous clay;
 pale stand the brother — to a statue chill,
 a conscious horror through his bosom thril:
 his fright eye abhor the beam of light,
 and long to find a never-ceasing night. 

shock at the sight of murder first begin,
 down the steep heaven roll the radiant sun,
 old night assume her appoint sway,
 stretch her black mantle over the face of day:
 now for their leader mourn the bleat lamb,
 that rove neglect by their pensive dam;
 the careful parent search the field around;
 they call — the wood roll back a empty sound. 

within a forest solitary gloom,
 sleep gentle Abel in a secret tomb,
 and there (beneath a cypress shade recline)
 Cain breathe his sorrow to the rush wind:
 that in the branch make a doleful sound;
 it be silence else, and horrid darkness round,
 when lo! a sudden and a pierce ray
 overspread the forest with a blaze of day,
 and then descend on the hallow ground,
 a seraph with empyreal glory crown:
 afflict Cain (that know not where to fly)
 gaze on the vision with distract eye:
 when thus the angel — why these mournful cry,
 these loud complaint that pierce the nightly sky. 
lye not to heaven, but direct say,
 where rove thy brother, where do Abel stray. 
he say — and thus the guilty wretch return;
 o sacred guardian, i for Abel mourn:
 i never behold he since the day begin, —
 but why this visit to a simple man? 
thus the celestial — wretch, can thou presume,
 thy brother blood may slumber in its tomb:
 or thou may ward off vengeance with a lye,
 and dare attempt deceive god most high;
 but now thy doom, o wretched mortal hear;
 the fleet hour nor the roll year,
 to thou nor joy, nor cheerful ease shall bring:
 alike to thou the winter and the spring,
 still vex with woe, thy heavy day shall fly
 beneath a radiant or a gloomy sky:
 curse shall thou be amid thy vagrant band,
 and curse the labour of thy guilty hand:
 he cease — but Cain all prostrate on the ground,
 still in his ear retain the dreadful sound:
 at length he rise, and tremble thus begin;
 this be too much — too much for mortal man:
 the mighty debt, o let i quick pay,
 and sweep i instant from the beam of day:
 the yet unborn, that i be curse, shall know,
 and all shall hate i to augment the blow:
 even my own son, if such be give to be
 the death of Abel, shall revenge on i:
 thus he to change the dreadful sentence try,
 thus the seraphic messenger reply;
 this mark, o Cain, i fix upon thy brow:
 and thus by heaven mighty monarch vow,
 who shed thy blood, that criminal shall be
 curse — seven time curse, and wretched more than thou. 
thus be that mortal who shall tear the rod
 of scorch vengeance from the hand of god;
 that man may learn to fear the king of king:
 he say — and wave his immortal wing,
 that instant mingle with the starry train,
 and darkness wrap the silent shade again.
