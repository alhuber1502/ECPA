TO ORESTES.

TO vex thy Soul with these unjust alarms,
 Fye dear mistrustful, can'st thou doubt thy charms;
 Or think a breast so young and soft as mine,
 Could e're resist such charming eyes as thine? 
Not love thee! witness all ye powers above,
 (That know my heart) to what excess I love,
 How many tender sighs for thee I've spent,
 I who ne're knew what serious passion meant. 
Till to revenge his slighted Votaries,
 The God of love, coucht in thy beauteous eyes,
 At once inspir'd and fixt my roving heart,
 Which till that moment sconr'd his proudest dart,
 And now I languish out my life for thee,
 As others unregarded do for me;
 Silent as night, and pensive as a dove,
 Through shades more gloomy than my thoughts I rove,
 With downcast eyes as languishing an Air,
 The Emblem I of Love, and of Dispair.
