NOW SANDY MAUN AWA.

THE drum has beat the General,
 Now Sandy maun awa,
 But first he gaes the lasses roun
 To bid God bless them a'! 

Down smirking Sally's dimpl'd cheek
 The tear begins to fa:
 "O! Sandy, I am wae to think
 That ye maun leave us a'." 

Poor Maggy sighs, and sings the sang
 He lik'd the best of a',
 And hopes by that to ease her heart
 When Sandy's far awa. 

Alak! poor silly maiden,
 Your skill in love's but sma;
 We shouldna think o' auld langsyne
 When sweethearts are awa. 

In blithsome Nancy's open heart
 His looks hae made a flaw;
 An' yet she vows the men a' loons,
 And Sandy warst of a'. 

Now Jenny she affects to scorn,
 And sneers at their ill-fa;
 She reckons a' the warld thinks
 She likes him best of a'. 

At gentle Kitty's weel-kenn'd door
 He ca'd the last of a';
 Because his heart bade him say mair
 To her than to them a':

My gentle Kate, gin ye'll prove true,
 I'll slight the lasses a'
 On thee alane I'll swear to think
 When I am far awa. 

Now Sandy's ta'en his bonnet off,
 An' waves fareweel to a';
 And cries, "Await till I come back,
 An' I will kiss ye a'."
