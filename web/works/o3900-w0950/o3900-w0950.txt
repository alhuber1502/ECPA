In AFFLICTION.

I.

ETERNAL Beam of Light Divine,
 Fountain of unexhausted Love,
 In whom the FATHER's Glories shine,
 Thro' Earth beneath, and Heav'n above! 

II.

JESU! the weary Wand'rer's Rest;
 Give me thy easy Yoke to bear,
 With stedfast Patience arm my Breast,
 With spotless Love and lowly Fear. 

III.

Thankful I take the Cup from Thee,
 Prepar'd and mingled by thy Skill:
 Tho' bitter to the Taste it be,
 Pow'rful the wounded Soul to heal. 

IV.

Be Thou, O Rock of Ages, nigh:
 So shall each murm'ring Thought be gone,
 And Grief, and Fear, and Care shall fly,
 As Clouds before the Mid-day Sun. 

V.

Speak to my warring Passions, "Peace;"
 Say to my trembling Heart, "Be still:
 Thy Pow'r my Strength and Fortress is,
 For all Things serve Thy Sov'reign Will. 

VI.

O Death, where is thy Sting? Where now
 Thy boasted Victory, O Grave? 
Who shall contend with GOD: Or Who
 Can hurt whom GOD delights to save?
