song.

dear shade of bliss, enchant hope,
 thy fairy dream be almost over;
 bewilder, weary, faint, i stop,
 my heart, alas! believe not more. 

yet from the beat track i stray,
 and truant fancy wander far,
 to catch one faint and tremble ray
 from thy obscure and distant star. 

come, dear delusion, smile once more,
 if in thy smile i may be bless! 
spread thy green mantle on the shore. 
and give thy anchor to my breast.
