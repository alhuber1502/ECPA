SONG.

DEAR shade of bliss, enchanting hope,
 Thy fairy dreams are almost o'er;
 Bewilder'd, weary, faint, I stop,
 My heart, alas! believes no more. 

Yet from the beaten track I stray,
 And truant fancy wanders far,
 To catch one faint and trembling ray
 From thy obscure and distant star. 

Come, dear delusion, smile once more,
 If in thy smiles I may be bless'd! 
Spread thy green mantle on the shore. 
And give thy anchor to my breast.
