to the same. 

to he who in a hour must die,
not swift seem that hour to fly,
than slow the minute seem to i,
which keep i from the sight of thou.

not more that tremble wretch will give
another day or year to live;
than i to shorten what remain
of that long hour which thou detain.

oh! come to my impatient arm,
oh! come with all thy heavenly charm,
at once to justify and pay
the pain i feel from this delay.
