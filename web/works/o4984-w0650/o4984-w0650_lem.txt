the fairy answer to mrs. Greville.

by the countess of C—.

without preamble, to my friend,
 these hasty line i be bid to send,
 or give, if i be able;
 i dare not hesitate to say,
 though i have tremble all the day —
 it look so like a fable. 

last night adventure be my theme,
 and shall it strike you as a dream,
 yet soon its high import
 must make you own the matter such,
 so delicate, it be too much,
 to be compose in sport. 

the moon do shine serene bright,
 and every star do deck the night,
 while zephyr fan the tree,
 no more assail my mind repose,
 save, that yond stream, which murmur flow,
 do echo to the breeze. 

enwrap in solemn thought, i sit,
 revolve over the turn of fate,
 yet void of hope, or fear;
 when lo! behold a aery throng,
 with light step, and jocund song,
 surprise my eye and ear. 

a form, superior to the rest,
 his little voice to i address,
 and gentle thus begin,
 "I have hear strange thing from one of you,
" pray tell i if you think it be true,
 "explain it if you can. 

 "such incense have perfume my throne! 
" such eloquence my heart have win! 
 "i think i guess the hand;
" i know her wit and beauty too,
 "but why she send a prayer so new,
" i can understand. 

 "to light some flame, and some revive,
" to keep some other just alive,
 "full oft i be implore;
" but, with peculiar power to please,
 "to supplicate for nought but ease —
" it be odd, upon my word! 

 "tell she, with fruitless care i have seek,
" and though my realm, with wonder fraught,
 "in remedy abound,
" no grain of cold indifference
 "be ever yet ally to sense,
" in all my fairy round. 

 "the region of the sky i will trace,
" i will ransack every earthly place,
 "each leaf, each herb, each flower,
" to mitigate the pang of fear,
 "dispel the cloud of black despair,
" or lull the restless hour. 

 "i will be generous, as i be just,
" but i obey, as other must,
 "those law which fate have make. 
" my tiny kingdom how defend,
 "and what may be the horrid end
" shall man my state invade? 

 "it will put your mind into a rage,
" and such unequal war to wage
 "suit not my regal duty! 
" i dare not change a first decree,
 "she be doom to please, nor can be free,
" such be the lot of beauty! " 

this say, he dart over the plain,
 and after follow all his train;
 no glimpse of he i find;
 but sure i be, the little spright
 these word, before he take his flight,
 imprint on my mind.
