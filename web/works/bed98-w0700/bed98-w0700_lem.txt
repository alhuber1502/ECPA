on the omnipresence of god.

if i to god my way approve,
how can my spirit yield to fear;
shall earthly comfort all remove,
my heavenly friend be ever near.

he be with i through the busy day,
and through the silence of the night;
attend i in my public way,
and when retire i meet his sight.

if tempter try my soul to win,
he see my struggle, and the snare;
and if i, yield, dare to sin,
the god who i offend be there.

if grief shall in my heart prevail,
and every aid shall i forsake;
sleep to my weary eye shall fail,
and food in bitterness i take:

though i in overwhelm fear,
to earthly friend in vain apply;
check be my sigh, restrain my tear,
the god who can protect be nigh.

if earth to i a world of joy,
and he who bless i be forget;
the power be by who can destroy,
the giver, who i have not seek.

when first i draw my vital breath,
i be my maker present care;
and when my heart expire in death,
god, my supporter, will be there.
