EXTEMPORE ON ARRIVING IN THE COUNTRY.

Can silent pleasures give my love the smile
 Of sweet content, of happiness serene? 
Can Anna's care, her tenderness beguile
 The languor of a solitary scene? 

Yes, for with anxious love I'll watch his eye,
 His will, his wishes in his features trace;
 With fond impatience to prevent them fly,
 My sweet reward, a smile from his dear face.
