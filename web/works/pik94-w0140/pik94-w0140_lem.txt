extempore on arrive in the country.

can silent pleasure give my love the smile
 of sweet content, of happiness serene? 
can anna care, her tenderness beguile
 the languor of a solitary scene? 

yes, for with anxious love i will watch his eye,
 his will, his wish in his feature trace;
 with fond impatience to prevent they fly,
 my sweet reward, a smile from his dear face.
