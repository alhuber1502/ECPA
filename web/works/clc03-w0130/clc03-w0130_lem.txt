the happy Man.  

he be the happy man who constant mind
be to the enjoyment of himself confine:
who have within lay up a plenteous store,
and be so rich that he desire no more:
who soul be always easy, firm, and brave,
and much too great to be ambition slave:
who Fortune frown without concern can bear,
and think it less to suffer, than to fear:
who, still the same, keep up his native state,
unmoved at all the menace of fate:
who all his passion absolute sway,
and to his reason cheerful homage pay,
who be with a halcyon calmness ever bless,
with inward joy, untroubled peace, and rest:
who while the most with toil, with guilt, and heat,
lose their dear quiet to be rich and great,
both business, and disturb croud do shun,
please that his work be with less trouble do:
to who a grove, a garden, or a field,
much great, much sublime pleasure yield,
than they can find in all the charm of power,
those splendid ill which so much time devour:
who more than life, his friend and book can prize,
and for those joy the noisy world despise:
who when death call, no weakness do betray,
nor to a unbecoming fear give way;
but to himself, and to his maxim true,
lie smile down, and bid mankind adieu.
