Rinaldo and Armida.

to a lady sing.

by the same.

the goldfinch swell his little throat,
 and loud pour his rural note;
 high poise above his nest in air,
 the shrill lark chant his matin clear;
 at evening brown, in woodland dale
 soft gurgle trill her amorous tale
 the solitary nightingale;
 but what avail, you feather throng
 of warbler wild, your feeble song? 
our vary passion can you move
 with warm hope, or fond love? 
or run your note the enchant round
 through all the labyrinth of sound? 
as breathe some soft angelic strain,
 when midnight spread her solemn reign,
 entrance the lonely hermit lie,
 and taste ideal paradise,
 when at armida foot he lie,
 so sigh rinaldo soul away;
 his tongue in mute attention bind,
 his ear in rapture drink the sound,
 while magic number lull the sense,
 and hold swift thought in sweet suspense. 

the mimic voice repeat the gale
 that sigh along the flowery vale;
 the flowery vale, the fall flood,
 the rise rock, and wave wood
 to the sigh gale reply,
 redouble all the harmony. 

the zephyr, ever mild and fair,
 who light fan the vernal air,
 learn from armida voice the strain,
 and whisper tell it to the main. 
whenever, the foam billow flow,
 the wintery storm be fierce blow,
 when sable cloud invade the pole,
 and lightning dart, and thunder roll,
 the enchantress can the rage appease,
 and clear the sky, and smooth the sea. 

when hurry to the infernal coast,
 his beauteous bride the thracian lose,
 sure, hapless youth! so sweet a spell
 once more have charm the power of hell;
 or if such have be the song
 which warble erst the siren throng,
 for council sage the chief renown
 his warrior limb have vain bind;
 his eye by love entranced, no more
 have see with joy their native shore;
 the cord have loose; the magic tale
 have stay his oar, and furl his sail.
