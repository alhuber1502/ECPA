the physician and the monkey.

a epigram.

a lady send late to one doctor drug,
 to come in a instant, and clyster poor pug —
 as the fair one command he come at the word,
 and do the grand office in tie-wig and sword. 

the affair be end, so sweet and so nice! 
he hold out his hand with — "you know, madam, my price." 
 "your price," say the lady — "why, sir, he be your brother,
" and doctor must never take fee of each other. "
