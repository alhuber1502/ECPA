The PHYSICIAN and the MONKEY.

An EPIGRAM.

A LADY sent lately to one Doctor Drug,
 To come in an instant, and clyster poor Pug —
 As the fair one commanded he came at the word,
 And did the grand office in tie-wig and sword. 

The affair being ended, so sweet and so nice! 
He held out his hand with — "You know, ma'am, my price." 
 "Your price," says the lady — "Why, Sir, he's your brother,
" And doctors must never take fees of each other. "
