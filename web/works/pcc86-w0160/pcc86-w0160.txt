To a Brother of the Author's.

WE wish you joy — like us to meet
 The spring in all its gay attire;
 The fields to range in rural sport;
 The manly thought, and bold design. 

To us belong the woods and groves,
 Each gentle art, and kind reply;
 In truth and innocence unite,
 Our minds improve — but guess for whom.
