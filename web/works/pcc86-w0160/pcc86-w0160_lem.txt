to a brother of the author.

we wish you joy — like we to meet
 the spring in all its gay attire;
 the field to range in rural sport;
 the manly thought, and bold design. 

to we belong the wood and grove,
 each gentle art, and kind reply;
 in truth and innocence unite,
 our mind improve — but guess for who.
