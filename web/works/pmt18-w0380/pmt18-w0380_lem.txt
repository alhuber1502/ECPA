Hagar in the desert.

injure, hopeless, faint, and weary,
 sad, indignant, and forlorn,
 through the desert wild and dreary,
 Hagar lead the child of scorn. 

who can speak a mother anguish,
 paint in that tearless eye,
 which behold her darling languish,
 languish unrelieved, and die. 

lo! the empty pitcher fail she,
 perish with thirst he lie,
 death with deep despair assail she,
 piteous as for aid he cry. 

from the dreadful image fly,
 wild she rush from the sight;
 in the agony of die
 can she see her soul delight? 

now bereave of every hope,
 cast upon the burn ground,
 poor, abandon soul! look up,
 mercy have thy sorrow find. 

lo! the angel of the lord
 come thy great distress to cheer;
 listen to the gracious word,
 see divine relief be near. 

 "care of heaven! though man forsake thou,
 wherefore vain do thou mourn? 
from thy dream of woe awake thou,
 to thy rescue child return. 

 "lift thy eye, behold yond fountain,
 sparkle amid those fruitful tree;
 lo! beneath yond shelter mountain
 smile for thou green bower of ease. 

 "in the hour of sore affliction
 god have see and pity thou;
 cheer thou in the sweet conviction,
 thou henceforth his care shall be. 

 "be no more by doubt distress,
 mother of a mighty race! 
by contempt no more oppress,
 thou have find a rest place. " â€”

thus from peace and comfort drive,
 thou, poor soul, all desolate,
 hopeless lay, till pity heaven
 find thou, in thy abject state. 

over thy empty pitcher mourn
 amid the desert of the world;
 thus, with shame and anguish burn,
 from thy cherish pleasure hurl:

see thy great deliverer nigh,
 call thou from thy sorrow vain,
 bid thou on his love rely,
 bless the salutary pain. 

from thy eye the mist dispell,
 lo! the well of life he show,
 in his presence ever dwell,
 bid thou find thy true repose. 

future prospect rich in blessing
 open to thy hope secure;
 sure of endless joy possess,
 of a heavenly kingdom sure.
