The Politicians.

HOw grosly do the Learn'd and Wise
Mistake in Loves State-policies!
If I and Caelia chance to jar,
They take our Feuds for open War;
So little they perceive the pow'r
Of Quarrels to Improve Amour. 
Do we not see how perfect are
The Loves of ev'ry Turtle Pair,
Yet they like us disguise their Bliss,
Cooing and murmuring while they Kiss!
Love's Fire like Lightning shines as fair
In Storms as in Serener Air.
Let none my Caelia judge the mode
Of our Amour, and call it odd;
But such as Love to our Degree
(If any more such Lovers be!)
Whose wedded Love persists the same,
As when we burnt in Virgin Flame.
Sometimes like parting Streams we stray,
And seem to Rove a sundry way,
But meet ere long, and so United move
Till we are lost in a full Sea of Love.
