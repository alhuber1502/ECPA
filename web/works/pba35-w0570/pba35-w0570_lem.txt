Stella and Flavia.

Stella and Flavia, every hour,
 unnumbered heart surprise:
 in stella soul lie all her power,
 and flavia, in her eye. 

more boundless flavia conquest be,
 and stella more confine:
 all can discern a face that be fair,
 but few a lovely mind. 

Stella, like britain monarch, reign
 over cultivate land;
 like eastern tyrant, Flavia deign
 to rule over barren sand. 

then boast, fair Flavia, boast your face,
 your beauty only store:
 your charm will every day decrease,
 each day give Stella more.
