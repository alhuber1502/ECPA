the evergreen.

when tepid breeze fan the air,
and violet perfume the glade,
pensive and grave my charm fair
beneath yond shady lime be lay.

flourish, say i, those favour bough,
and ever sooth the pure flame!
witness to none but faithful vow!
wound by none but faithful name!

yield every tree that crown the grove
to this which please my wander dear!
range where you will, you band of love,
you still shall seem to revel here.

Lavinia smile — and while her arm
her fair recline head sustain,
betray she feel some fresh alarm;
and thus the meaning smile explain.

when summer sun shine forth no more,
will then this lime its shelter yield?
protect we when the tempest roar,
and winter drive we from the field?

yet faithful then the fir shall last —
i smile, she cry, but ah! i tremble,
to think when my fair season past,
which Damon then will most resemble.
