to the right honourable JOHN lord Cutts. 

[at the siege of namure.]

the HARDY soldier.

i 

 "o why be man so thoughtless grow? 
" why guilty soul in have to die? 
 "venture the leap to world unknown,
" and heedless to the battle fly? 

ii.

 "be live but worth a soldier pay? 
" why will you join such wide extreme? 
 "and stake immortal soul in play
" at desperate chance and bloody game? 

iii.

 "valour a noble turn of thought,
" who pardon guilt forbid her fear:
 "calm she meet the deadly shot
" secure of life above the star. 

iv.

 "but frenzy dare eternal fate,
" and spur with honour airy dream
 "fly to attack the infernal gate,
" and force a passage to the flame. 

v. 

thus hover over namvria plain
 sing heavenly love in Gabriel form:
 young thraso feel the move strain,
 and vow to pray before the storm. 

vi.

anon the thunder trumpet call,
 "my vow be damn, the hero cry,
 then swear by heaven, and scale the wall,
 drop in the ditch, despair, and die.
