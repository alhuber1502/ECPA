1 TIM. v. 6. She that liveth in Pleasure, is Dead while She liveth.

HOW hapless is th' applauded Virgin's Lot,
 Her GOD forgetting, by her GOD forgot! 
Stranger to Truth, unknowing to obey,
 In Error nurst, and disciplin'd to stray;
 Swoln with Self-will, and principled with Pride,
 Sense all her Good, and Passion all her Guide:
 Pleasure its Tide, and Flatt'ry lends its Breath,
 And smoothly waft her to Eternal Death! 

A Goddess Here, she sees her Vot'ries meet,
 Crowd to her Shrine, and tremble at her Feet;
 She hears their Vows, Believes their Life and Death
 Hangs on the Wrath and Mercy of her Breath;
 Supreme in fancy'd State she reigns her Hour,
 And glories in her Plenitude of Pow'r:
 Herself the Only Object worth her Care,
 Since all the kneeling World was made for Her. 

For Her, Creation all its Stores displays,
 The Silkworms labour, and the Diamonds blaze:
 Air, Earth, and Sea conspire to tempt her Taste,
 And ransack'd Nature furnishes the Feast. 
Life's gaudiest Pride attracts her willing Eyes,
 And Balls, and Theaters, and Courts arise:
 Italian Songsters pant her Ear to please,
 Bid the first Cries of infant Reason cease,
 Save her from Thought, and lull her Soul to Peace. 

Deep sunk in Sense th' imprison'd Soul remains,
 Nor knows its Fall from GOD, nor feels its Chains:
 Unconscious still, sleeps on in Error's Night,
 Nor strives to rise, nor struggles into Light:
 Heav'n-born in vain, degen'rate cleaves to Earth,
 (No Pangs experienc'd of the Second Birth)
 She only Faln, yet Unawaken'd found,
 While All th' enthrall'd Creation groans around.
