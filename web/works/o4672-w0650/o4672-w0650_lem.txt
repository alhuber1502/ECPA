to Thomas gunston ESQ

happy solitude.

i 

the noisy world complain of i
 that i shall shun their sight, and flee
 visit, and crowd and company. 
gunston, the lark dwell in her nest
 until she mount the sky;
 and in my closet i can rest
 till to the heaven i rise. 

ii.

yet they will urge, "this private life
" can never make you bless,
 "and twenty door be still at strife
" the engage you for a guest? 
friend, shall you see the louvre, or Whitehall
 open their royal gate, and call,
 and wait for Watts to come,
 he have no business there at all
 who find so much at home. 

iii.

when i within my self retreat,
 i shut my door against the great;
 my busy eyeball inward roll,
 and there with large survey i see
 all the wide theatre of i,
 and view the various scene of my retire soul;
 there i walk over the maze i have tread,
 while hope and fear be in a doubtful strife
 whether this opera of life
 be act well to gain the plaudit of my god. 

iv.

there be a day hasten, (it be a awful day)
 when the great sovereign shall at large review
 all that we speak and all we do,
 the several part we act on this wide stage of clay:
 these he approve, and those he blame,
 and crown perhaps a porter, and a prince he damn
 o if the judge from his tremendous seat
 shall not condemn what i have do,
 i shall be happy though unknown,
 nor need the gaze rabble, nor the shout street. 

v. 

i hate the glory, friend, that spring
 from vulgar breath and empty sound;
 fame mount she upward with a flatter gale
 upon her airy wing
 till envy shoot, and fame receive the wound;
 then her flag pinion fail,
 down glory fall and strike the ground
 and break her batter limb. 
rather let i be quite conceal from fame;
 how happy i shall lie
 in sweet obscurity,
 nor the loud world pronounce my little name! 
here i can live and die alone;
 or if society be due
 to keep our taste of pleasure new,
 gvnston, i'de live and die with you,
 for both our soul be one. 

vi.

here we can sit and pass the please hour,
 and pity kingdom and their king,
 and smile at all their shine thing,
 their toy of state, and image of power;
 vertue shall dwell within our seat,
 vertue alone can make it sweet,
 nor be her self secure but in a close retreat. 
while she withdraw from public praise
 envy perhaps will cease to rail,
 envy it self may innocent gaze
 at beauty in a Vail. 
but if she once advance to light,
 her charm be lose in envy sight,
 and vertue be the mark of universal spite.
