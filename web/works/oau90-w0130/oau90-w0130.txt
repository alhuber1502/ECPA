The HEALTH.

A Second Movement.

ADIEU to Virginity,
That silly strange nothing, that Maids are so fond of,
Room, Room, for the Bridegroom, he,
All Beauty's dear Trophies has now the command of:
Banish all thoughts of resty Diana,
Crown the full Bowl, a Health to Lucina. 
Who ere the Year be run,
Gives the fair Bride a Son,
Able, able, to pledge his own.
