the health.

a second movement.

adieu to virginity,
that silly strange nothing, that maid be so fond of,
room, room, for the bridegroom, he,
all beauty dear trophy have now the command of:
banish all thought of resty Diana,
crown the full bowl, a health to Lucina. 
who ere the year be run,
give the fair bride a son,
able, able, to pledge his own.
