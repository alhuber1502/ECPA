upon a visit to the same in winter, 1748. 

by the same.

i 

on fair asteria blissful plain,
where ever-blooming fancy reign,
how please we pass the winter day;
and charm the dull-eyed spleen away!

ii.

no linnet, from the leafless bough,
pour forth her note melodious now;
but all admire asteria tongue,
nor wish the linnet vernal song.

iii.

no flower emit their transient ray:
yet sure asteria wit display
more various tint, more glow line,
and with perennial beauty shine.

iv.

though rifle grove and fetter stream
but ill befriend a poet dream:
asteria presence wake the lyre;
and well supply poetic fire.

v. 

the field have lose their lovely dye;
no cheerful azure deck the sky;
yet still we bless the lour day:
Asteria smile — and all be gay.

vi.

hence let the muse no more presume
to blame the winter dreary gloom;
accuse his loiter hour no more;
but ah! their envious haste deplore!

vii.

for soon, from wit and friendship reign,
the social hearth, the sprightly vein,
i go — to meet the come year,
on savage plain, and desert drear!

viii.

i go — to feed on pleasure fly,
nor find the spring my loss atone!
but amid the flowery sweet of may
with pride recall this winter day.
