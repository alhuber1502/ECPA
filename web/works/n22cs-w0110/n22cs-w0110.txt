SONNET  XI. To Sleep. 

COME balmy Sleep! tir'd Nature's soft resort! 
On these sad temples all thy poppies shed;
 And bid gay dreams from Morpheus' airy court,
 Float in light vision round my aching head! 
Secure of all thy blessings, partial Power! 
On his hard bed the peasant throws him down;
 And the poor sea boy, in the rudest hour,
 Enjoys thee more than he who wears a crown. 
Clasp'd in her faithful shepherd's guardian arms,
 Well may the village girl sweet slumbers prove;
 And they, O gentle Sleep! still taste thy charms,
 Who wake to labour, liberty and love. 
But still thy opiate aid dost thou deny
 To calm the anxious breast; to close the streaming eye.
