psalm cxxxvii.

by the same.

where the fair stream of fame Euphrates stray,
 and make the vale of Babylonia gay,
 on the green border of the silver flood,
 judea exile mournful child stand:
 a pensive band, oppress with grief severe,
 for zion fate they shed the frequent tear;
 their silent harp, so tuneful late, unstring,
 high on the branch of the willow hang;
 when lo! their enemy demand the strain
 that erst resound sweet on judah plain. â€”
 how shall these song, Jehovah, sovereign king! 
in this strange clime thy captive people sing? 
let my right hand forget the note to play,
 let my mute tongue forget to tune the lay,
 if ever my thought neglectful, faithless rove,
 from thou, o Salem! and thy sacred grove:
 but, mighty lord! remember thou their seed,
 who bid thy city mourn, thy people bleed! 
shall not ever long proud babel turret fall,
 and in her fair street noisome reptile crawl;
 her haughty warrior pale and breathless lie,
 dash on the stone her helpless infant die,
 the woe we suffer be to she repay,
 and all her glory sink in everlasting shade?
