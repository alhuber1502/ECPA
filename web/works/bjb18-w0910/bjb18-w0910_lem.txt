a hymn.

o lord supreme, who work so fair,
 sublime and vary, every where
 the gaze eye delight! 
thy wisdom, power, and love, the day
 do in its splendid course display,
 as do the glorious night,

we look upon the ocean wide,
 where ship upon the billow ride,
 and sea-bird wing the air,
 and feel, as over the blue expanse
 soft shadow pass and sunbeam glance,
 thy power and love be there. 

and also on the chequer land,
 where mountain peak, and forest grand,
 with people plain between,
 and rise slow from man abode
 the grey smoke on its heavenward road,
 in fair array be see. 

thus day and night, and land, and sea,
 each in its turn, o lord! of thou
 speak to the mental ear:
 and still the thought that they impart
 be, to the christian pilgrim heart,
 most cherish and most dear.
