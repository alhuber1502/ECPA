to mr. Norris, on his idea of happiness.

i 

if pythagorick notion will agree,
 with sublimate christianity;
 what mighty soul, shall i allow,
 inform thy body now;
 for when do such appear,
 sure the belove disciple soul be here. 
not use since then, but keep above,
 and teach a more ecstatic love;
 the understanding more enlarge and free,
 each generous faculty
 refine, improve, make more complete,
 in the seraphic seat. 
the bright warm of the exalt choir,
 flame with ray of beatific fire;
 such seem thy elevate soul to be,
 and not the usual sort give to mortality. 

ii.

the great, the eternal god of love,
 take pity on we from above;
 he can no long see,
 our soul wrap in obscurity:
 but send thou like, a bright celestial ray,
 to clear our sight, and to direct the way;
 to the etherial court of bliss,
 the only great, and last happiness. 
the active native principle of love,
 we find do move
 by a internal influence,
 but it be towards some object of the sense:
 effect and cause be not understand,
 we only know we wish for good,
 and will with joy each glimpse pursue,
 resolve to fasten there, and think it be true. 
in vain we think our love be fix,
 for all those joy be intermix
 with disappointment and deceit,
 our struggle soul themselves do cheat:
 still they desire and love, but be not bless,
 nor find they rest,
 till thy bright pen mark out the happy prize,
 teach we at once to love and to be wise. 

iii.

thou do disect our weak distemper soul,
 discover'st the disease and make we whole;
 prescribe such method, which if we obey,
 we shall no long dote on clay,
 which long our vitiate soul have feed,
 but shall have appetite to celestial bread. 
we shall no long fond play,
 with trifle on the way,
 but climb the hill with a delightful have,
 and feast our soul at thy divine repast. 
but lest, like doubtful or unthankful guest,
 we shall neglect the royal feast;
 thou, to encourage our appearance there,
 have kind give we a bill of fare. 

iv.

by powerful energy of thought divine,
 thou do thy soul raise and refine,
 with strong impulse it do upward move,
 mount on eager wing of love;
 through all the inferior court it make its way,
 to the bright spring of everlasting day;
 do all the amaze glory see,
 and what it shall hereafter be,
 salute by the soft seraphic choir,
 who be anthem all its faculty inspire,
 but flash to mighty ray of sacred fire. 
for the refulgent glory be too great,
 it can not bear such rapture yet,
 till immortality have make it more complete:
 it can no long stay, no long view,
 then down again it fly,
 do with angelic radiance shine,
 inspire with sapience divine. 
it do its bright etherial voyage tell,
 and in what bliss depart soul do dwell:
 all this in pure and pregnant elegance we hear,
 plain as corporeal organ can declare,
 that when we read thy line we almost think we be there.
