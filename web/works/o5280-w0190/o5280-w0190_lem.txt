address to the shade of SHAKSPEARE.

on mrs. B—'S visit his tomb in company with the writer of these line, august 13, 1787. 

to the reverend H— Todd, a.m. 

swift from the radiant realm of light,
 to avon stream direct thy flight,
 and see, unawed by midnight gloom,
 Eliza seek thy laureled tomb:
 now see the flame that gild thy urn,
 at her approach more splendid burn:
 see banish now the gloom profound,
 for beauty shed its light around. 
while genius wave his torch on high,
 triumphant point to the sky,
 then smile hail the bloom dame,
 the rival of no vulgar fame,
 around she Shakspeare hallow tomb
 let nature scatter all her bloom;
 there, plant by the tuneful nine,
 there shall the verdant laurel shine;
 the primrose pale, the violet blue,
 there, there shall drink the morning dew;
 while fancy fair shall deck his bier
 with every flower to genius dear.
