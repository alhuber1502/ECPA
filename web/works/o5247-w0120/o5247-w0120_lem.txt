a song.

i 

what torment must the virgin prove
 that feel the pang of hopeless love? 
what endless care must rack the breast
 that be by sure despair possess. 

ii.

when love in tender bosom reign,
 with all its soft, its please pain,
 why shall it be a crime to own
 the fatal flame we can shun. 

iii.

the soul by nature form sincere,
 a slavish force disguise must wear;
 leave the unthinking world reprove
 the heart that glow with generous love. 

iv.

but oh in vain the sigh repress,
 that gentle heave the pensive breast;
 the glow blush, the fall tear,
 the conscious wish, and silent fear. 

v. 

you soft betrayer aid my flame,
 and give my new desire a name:
 some power my gentle grief redress,
 reveal, or make my passion less.
