to miss moor, on her fire-screen.

when gloomy winter clad in snow,
 without one cheerful shade of green;
 when one blank view be all the shew,
 and not a leaf or flower see;

when now the shiver feather throng
 to distant warm region fly,
 or want food, or chill with frost,
 or by the fatal powder die:

you, my young fair one, of your own
 a new creation can provide:
 your flower gay bloom as in may,
 your tree the sharp frost abide. 

the flower never fade, nor drop the fruit,
 nor fade the verdure of the field;
 all the gay season in one scene,
 the ever-pleasing prospect yield. 

it be true, the music of the bird,
 escape your art, nor strike your ear. 
but see they perch on the tree,
 as if delight to be here. 

your tender mind be a fertile soil;
 may all the grace flourish there! 
may modesty protect the whole,
 and, as your face, your name be fair!
