remembrance.

how dear to i the twilight hour! 
it breathe, it speak of pleasure past;
 when Laura seek this humble bower,
 and over it courtly splendour cast. 

fond fancy friend, dim twilight, hail! 
thou can the absent nymph restore;
 and as around thy shadow sail,
 they bring the form i still adore. 

again her pensive smile i view,
 her modest eye soft chasten fire;
 and mark her cheek of tender hue
 from thou a soft tint acquire. 

no eye but i in that dim hour
 the soft blush maid can see;
 and then her voice of magic power
 charm with its sweetness none but i. 

but now, alas! to distant plain,
 to crowd scene, perhaps, she fly;
 she speak, to charm unnumbered swain;
 she smile, to bless unnumbered eye. 

yet if, while crowd before thou bow,
 thy lip to favour smile incline,
 think not, sweet maid, their bosom glow
 with love as pure, as true as i. 

reflect, .... i kneel before thy foot,
 afraid to speak, or look, or move,
 nor even thy pity dare entreat
 for hour of hopeless pine love. 

they can with bold unfaltering tongue
 their loudly-boasted flame reveal;
 but, Laura, spurn the heartless throng,
 they talk of pang i only feel. 

from glow cheek, and sparkle eye,
 o turn, my Laura! turn to he
 from who sink cheek the colour fly,
 who eye with hopeless love be dim. 

o turn to i, who blight youth
 the wreck of former day appear! .... 
but well the change have prove my truth,
 and thou will own that change endear. 

yet, no; ah, no! forget, forget
 my ardent love, my faith, and i;
 remember not we ever meet;
 i will not cause one pang to thou. 

and when i hear that thou be bless,
 my own distress i will learn to scorn;
 i will bid imperious anguish rest,
 while smile my pallid lip adorn. 

deep in my heart the load of grief,
 conceal from every glance, shall lie;
 till sorrow prove its own relief,
 and i shall suffer, smile, and die.
