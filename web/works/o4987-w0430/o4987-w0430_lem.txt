sonnet.

to Delia.

by the same.

thrice have the year its vary circuit run,
 and cheerful, Delia, have the moment fly,
 since with my love for thou, my care begin
 to form thy tender mind to virtue prone:

the flattery of my sex i bid thou shun,
 i bid thou shun the folly of thy own;
 fictitious manner by example win,
 alike to truth and innocence unknown:

say, bloom maiden, in who gentle breast
 reign simple nature undisguised by art,
 now ample try by time unerring test,
 how just the dictate of this faithful heart,
 that with the joy thy favour smile impart,
 deem all its care repair, itself supreme bless.
