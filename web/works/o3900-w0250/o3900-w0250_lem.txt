i 

enslave to sense, to pleasure prone,
 fond of create good;
 father, our helplesness we own,
 and tremble taste our food. 

ii.

tremble we taste: for ah! no more
 to thou the creature lead;
 change they exert a fatal power,
 and poison while they feed. 

iii.

curse for the sake of wretched man,
 they now engross he whole,
 with please force on earth detain,
 and sensualize his soul. 

iv.

grovel on earth we still must lie
 till Christ the curse repeal;
 till Christ descend from on high
 infect nature heal. 

v. 

come then, our heavenly Adam, come! 
thy heal influence give;
 Hallow our food, reverse our doom,
 and bid we eat and live. 

vi.

the bondage of corruption break! 
for this our spirit groan;
 thy only will we fain will seek;
 o save we from our own. 

vii.

turn the full stream of nature tide:
 let all our action tend
 to thou their source; thy love the guide,
 thy glory be the end. 

viii.

earth then a scale to heaven shall be,
 sense shall point out the road;
 the creature then shall lead to thou,
 and all we taste be god!
