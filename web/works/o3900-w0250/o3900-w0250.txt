Another.

I.

ENslav'd to Sense, to Pleasure prone,
 Fond of Created Good;
 Father, our Helplesness we own,
 And trembling taste our Food. 

II.

Trembling we taste: for ah! no more
 To Thee the Creatures lead;
 Chang'd they exert a Fatal Pow'r,
 And poison while they feed. 

III.

Curst for the Sake of wretched Man,
 They now engross him whole,
 With pleasing Force on Earth detain,
 And sensualize his Soul. 

IV.

Grov'ling on Earth we still must lie
 Till CHRIST the Curse repeal;
 Till CHRIST descending from on high
 Infected Nature heal. 

V.

Come then, our Heav'nly Adam, come! 
Thy healing Influence give;
 Hallow our Food, reverse our Doom,
 And bid us eat and live. 

VI.

The Bondage of Corruption break! 
For this our Spirits groan;
 Thy only Will we fain would seek;
 O save us from our own. 

VII.

Turn the full Stream of Nature's Tide:
 Let all our Actions tend
 To Thee their Source; thy Love the Guide,
 Thy Glory be the End. 

VIII.

Earth then a Scale to Heav'n shall be,
 Sense shall point out the Road;
 The Creatures then shall lead to Thee,
 And all we taste be GOD!
