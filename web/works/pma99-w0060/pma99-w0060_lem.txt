a hymn.

my god, who all-pervading eye
 scan earth beneath and heaven above,
 witness if here or there thou see
 a object of my equal love. 

not the gay scene, where mortal man
 pursue their bliss, and find their woe,
 detain my rise heart, which spring
 the noble joy of heaven to know. 

not all the fair son of light,
 that lead the army round thy throne,
 can bound it be course, it press on. 
and seek it be rest in god alone. 

fix near the immortal source of bliss,
 firm and undaunted it survey
 each shape of horror and distress,
 that earth combine with hell can raise. 

this feeble flesh shall faint and die,
 this heart renew it be pulse no more;
 even now it view the moment nigh,
 when life last movement shall be over. 

thou vanquish king of terror, come! 
with thy own hand thy power destroy;
 approach, and bear my soul to god,
 my portion and eternal joy.
