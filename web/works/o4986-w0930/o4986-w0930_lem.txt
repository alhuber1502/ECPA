on may.

by the same.

the virgin, when soften by may,
 attend to the villager vow;
 the bird sweet bill on the spray,
 and poplar embrace with their bough. 
on Ida bright Venus may reign,
 adore for her beauty above;
 we shepherd, that live on the plain,
 hail may as the mother of love. 

from the west, as it wanton blow,
 fond zephyr caress the pine;
 the bee steal a kiss from the rose,
 and willow and woodbine entwine;
 the pink by the rivulet side,
 that border the vernal alcove,
 bend downwards to kiss the soft tide,
 for may be the mother of love. 

may tinge the butterfly wing;
 he flutter in bridal array:
 if the lark and the linnet now sing,
 their music be teach they by may. 
the stock-dove, recluse with her mate,
 conceal her fond bliss in the grove;
 and murmur seem to repeat,
 that may be the mother of love. 

the goddess will visit you soon;
 you virgin, be sportive and gay;
 get your pipe, oh you shepherd, in tune,
 for music must welcome the may. 
will Damon have Phillis prove kind,
 and all his keen anguish remove,
 let he tell a soft tale, and he will find,
 that may be the mother of love.
