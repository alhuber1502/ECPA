moonlight.

 "how sweet the moon now sleep upon yond bank,"
 cry nature firstborn, and delight see
 her fairy elf play many a wily prank,
 as she sail on majestical slow. 
her pale beam tremble over the sleep flower,
 the tall tree lengthen in the somber gloom;
 her bright gleam now light the leafy tower,
 now show the gothic arch of the dome. 
a wander cloud will sometime cross her way,
 her head oft bow let the stranger pass,
 while golden star the canopy enlay,
 and shadowy form fly over the wave grass. 
in solemn grove, where silver lamp late hang,
 the fear-struck traveller see huge spectre rise;
 see grisly ghost and stalk phantom come,
 as darkness draw the curtain of the sky. 
in yonder tower the meditative mind
 may suit the subject to the scene around,
 find some memento murmur in the wind,
 or print the small leaf that strew the ground.
