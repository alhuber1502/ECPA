ode to simplicity.

by the same.

o thou by nature teach,
 to breathe her genuine thought,
 in number warm pure, and sweet strong:
 who first on mountain wild,
 in fancy, lovely child,
 thy babe, or pleasure, nurse the power of song! 

thou, who with hermit heart
 disdain the wealth of art,
 and gaud, and pageant weed, and trail pall:
 but come a decent maid,
 in attic robe array,
 o chaste, unboastful nymph, to thou i call! 

by all the honeyed store
 on hybla thymy shore,
 by all her bloom and mingle murmur dear;
 by she, who love-lorn woe,
 in evening muse slow,
 soothe sweet sad electra poet ear:

by old cephisus deep,
 who spread his wavy sweep
 in warble wander round the green retreat,
 on who enamel side,
 when holy freedom die,
 no equal haunt allure thy future foot,

o sister meek of truth,
 to my admire youth,
 thy sober aid and native charm infuse! 
the flower that sweet breathe,
 though beauty cull the wreath,
 still ask thy hand to range their order hue. 

while Rome can none esteem,
 but virtue patriot theme,
 you love her hill, and lead the laureate band:
 but stay to sing alone
 to one distinguish throne,
 and turn thy face, and flee her alter land. 

no more, in hall or bower,
 the passion own thy power,
 love, only love, her forceless number mean:
 for thou have leave her shrine,
 nor olive more, nor vine,
 shall gain thy foot to bless the servile scene. 

though taste, though genius bless
 to some divine excess,
 faint the cold work till thou inspire the whole;
 what each, what all supply,
 may court, may charm your eye,
 thou, only thou, can raise the meeting soul! 

of these let other ask,
 to aid some mighty task,
 i only seek to find thy temperate vale:
 where oft my reed may sound
 to maid and shepherd round,
 and all thy son, o nature, learn my tale.
