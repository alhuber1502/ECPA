The ABSENT LOVER.

ALEXIS, walking in the Park,
 Met CHLOE, just before 'twas dark:
 He ask'd a Kiss, nor she deny'd;
 I don't know what they did beside:
 But, as a Child, in Thought, chews o'er
 The Sweetmeats, which he eat before;
 So in his Mind ALEXIS keeps
 The dear Impression of her Lips:
 He felt it all the foll'wing Day,
 At Night indulg'd it at the Play;
 One ling'ring Act he musing stay'd,
 But knew not what the Actors said;
 He thought the Park in Drury-lane,
 Believ'd the Nymph appear'd again;
 He seems to view her snowy Neck,
 Her ruby Lip, and rosy Cheek,
 Her graceful Smiles, and sparkling Eyes,
 Her panting Bosom fall and rise:
 And now he clasp'd her in his Arms,
 ('Twas all imaginary Charms)
 When, rising to the Height of Bliss,
 His Lips essay'd to take a Kiss;
 An Orange-wench trod on his Foot;
 And screaming, "Will you have some Fruit?" 
Surpriz'd, he dropt the pleasing Theme,
 And found his Joys a waking Dream;
 He swore, and wept, and kick'd the Wench,
 Forgot his Hat, and left the Bench.
