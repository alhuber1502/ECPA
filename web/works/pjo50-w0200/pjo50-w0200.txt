To the same.

On her parting with the first copy of Heaven, and sending for another.

Say, Stella, didst thou never look
 Into that great, that holy book,
 Which on the parson's desk is spread,
 And once a week, at least, is read;
 There, Stella, didst thou never see,
 How Angels lost their Heav'n, like Thee? 
And for a punishment beside,
 We're doom'd for ever to reside
 In hell, the fittest place for pride. 

Reflect on this â€” Yet lest thy heart
 Should with a thought so horrid start,
 Lest thy soft nature should relent,
 And Stella for her crime repent;
 Know, that the guilt for which they fell,
 Justly deserv'd the hottest hell. 

Thou thro' good nature may'st have err'd,
 And therefore shall thy pray'r be heard;
 Thy ev'ry wish shall be obtain'd,
 And Paradise with ease regain'd.
