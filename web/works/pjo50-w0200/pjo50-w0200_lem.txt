to the same.

on her part with the first copy of heaven, and send for another.

say, Stella, do thou never look
 into that great, that holy book,
 which on the parson desk be spread,
 and once a week, at least, be read;
 there, Stella, do thou never see,
 how angel lose their heaven, like thou? 
and for a punishment beside,
 we be doom for ever to reside
 in hell, the fit place for pride. 

reflect on this â€” yet lest thy heart
 shall with a thought so horrid start,
 lest thy soft nature shall relent,
 and Stella for her crime repent;
 know, that the guilt for which they fall,
 just deserve the hot hell. 

thou through good nature may have err,
 and therefore shall thy prayer be hear;
 thy every wish shall be obtain,
 and paradise with ease regain.
