write in the begin of a recovery from sickness.

i 

peace, flutter soul! the storm be over,
 end at last the doubtless strife:
 respire now, the cause explore
 that bind thou to a wretched life. 

ii.

when on the margin of the grave,
 why do i doubt my saviour art? 
ah! why mistrust his will to save? 
what mean that falter of my heart? 

iii.

it be not the search pain within
 that fill my coward flesh with fear;
 nor conscience of uncancel sin;
 nor sense of dissolution near. 

iv.

of hope i feel no joyful ground,
 the fruit of righteoufness alone;
 naked of Christ my soul i find,
 and start from a god unknown. 

v. 

corrupt my will, nor half subdue,
 can i his pure presence bear? 
unchanged, unhallowed, unrenewed
 can i before his face appear? 

vi.

father of mercy, hear my call! 
ere yet return the fatal hour,
 repair my loss, retrieve my fall,
 and raise i by thy quicken power. 

vii.

my nature re-exchange for thy;
 be thou my life, my hope, my gain;
 arm i in panoply divine,
 and death shall shake his dart in vain. 

viii.

when i thy promise Christ have see,
 and clasp he in my soul embrace,
 possess of my salvation, then â€”
 then, let i, lord, depart in peace!
