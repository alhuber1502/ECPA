the silent fair.

ballad v. 

i 

from all her fair loquacious kind,
 so different be my Rosalind,
 that not one accent can i gain
 to crown my hope, or sooth my pain. 

ii.

you lover, who can construe sigh,
 and be the interpreter of eye,
 to language all her look translate,
 and in her gesture read my fate. 

iii.

and if in they you chance to find
 ought that be gentle, ought that be kind,
 adieu mean hope of be great,
 and all the littleness of state. 

iv.

all thought of grandeur i will despise,
 which from dependence take their rise;
 to serve she shall be my employ,
 and love sweet agony my joy.
