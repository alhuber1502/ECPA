on the marriage of miss Johanna gale with the reverend p. Graham, rector of ARTHURET.

18th February, 1792. 

once a grove of sweet myrtle soft Venus will rear,
 and wreath it with rose around;
 it be a green shade for hope in each change of the year,
 in which she like best to be find. 
HYMEN mark out the spot, and will plant some sweet flower,
 so he set down his gay torch the while,
 which Cupid snatch up to set fire to the bower,
 for he joy in a mischievous wile. 

the taper burn clear, yet no leaf will consume,
 nor wither, nor drop from the spray;
 it just warm the bud, and increase their perfume,
 like the incense that be offer to may. 
hope run from her covert, to HYMEN she fly,
 he smile, and to comfort she say;
 "your grove in no danger, it be sacred to you
 and a meek blue-eyed beautiful maid. 

my torch for the purpose i have dip in a flame
 so lambent, it seem but to burn;
 it be light for a pair who one wish be the same,
 which from heart back to heart will return. 
while this sweet wish to please circle through every day,
 thy myrtle-bower's verdure shall last;
 and the heart look back shall perceive no decay,
 though the blossom of spring be all past. "
