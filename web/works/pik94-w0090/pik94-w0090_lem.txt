write in very deep affliction.

low on affliction gloomy bed,
 where sorrow hold her reign;
 where pleasure never deign a glance,
 i pray for peace in vain:

far, far remote from joy, from hope,
 no soothe voice i hear;
 nor do fair friendship lend one gleam,
 my faint heart to cheer. 

ah fortune! ever vary shade! 
false, disappoint shrine! 
to lure the young, believe heart,
 how bright thy prospect shine! 

contentment once illume my breast,
 no anxious care have i;
 serene slumber, sweet rest,
 with dream of peaceful joy. 

return morn new pleasure give,
 i wake to soft delight;
 but now my every blessing flee,
 day sink in horror night. 

be still, some spirit whisper, cease,
 thy suffering soon shall close;
 i come to guide thy wander foot
 to undisturbed repose. 

why start at death approach, â€” drear shade,
 it lead to pure air,
 immortal joy that never fade,
 no ill approach there! 

come, fear i not; though cold and pale,
 i now assert my claim:
 no guilt thy sink soul alarm;
 why tremble then thy frame? 

but hark! some angel whisper, stay,
 hope humble that reward
 promise to purity on earth,
 from heaven bright regard. 

then raise thy poor deject heart;
 remember there be a power
 that give thou being to be bless,
 but wise hide the hour:

in faith, hope, virtue, persevere,
 nor yield to black despair;
 for thy great parent arm will guide
 each daughter of his care. 

then let thy soul secure rest
 on that almighty word
 that gracious dispense good,
 and comfort will afford.
