the lyric Muse to mr. Mason.

on the recovery of the right honourable the earl of Holdernesse from a dangerous illness.

by the same.

Mason, snatch the votive lyre,
D'Arcy live, and i inspire.
it be the muse that deign to ask,
can thy hand forget its task?
or can the lyre its strain refuse
to the patron of the muse?

hark, what note of artless love
the feather poet of the grove,
grateful for the bower they fill,
warble wild on Sion hill;
in tuneful tribute due pay
to the master of the shade!

and shall the bard sit fancy-proof
beneath the hospitable roof,
where every menial face afford
rapture thought that want but word?
and the patron dear part,
the gentle sharer of his heart,
wear her wonted charm again.
time, that feel affliction chain,
learn on light wing to move;
and the tender pledge of love,
sweet Amelia, now be press
with double transport to her breast.
sweet Amelia, thoughtless why,
imitate the general joy;
innocent of care or guile
see the lovely mimic smile,
and, as the heart-felt rapture rise,
catch they from her mother eye.

do the noisy town deny
soothe air, and ecstasy?
sion shade afford retreat,
thither bend thy pilgrim foot.
there bid the imaginary train,
coinage of the poet brain,
not only in effect appear,
but form, and limb, and feature wear.
let festive mirth, with floweret crown,
light tread the measure round;
and peace, that seldom know to share
the statesman friendly bowl, be there;
while rosy health, superior guest,
loose to the zephyr bare her breast;
and, to add a sweet grace,
give she soft Amelia face.

Mason, why this dull delay?
haste, to Sion haste away.
there the muse again shall ask,
nor thy hand forget its task;
nor the lyre its strain refuse
to the patron of the muse.
