verse on the marriage of a certain amiable couple.

may William and his Charlotte live
 free from corrod care,
 may all delight the star can give
 attend the happy pair;
 may every tender passion reign,
 unrivaled in each breast,
 and free from anguish, free from pain,
 still blessing, and still bless. 
may balmy peace their mansion shield,
 and angel be their guard,
 may heaven repeat blessing yield,
 their virtue to reward.
