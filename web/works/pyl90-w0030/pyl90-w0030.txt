Verses on the Marriage of a Certain Amiable Couple.

MAY William and his Charlotte live
 Free from corroding care,
 May all delights the stars can give
 Attend the happy pair;
 May every tender passion reign,
 Unrivall'd in each breast,
 And free from anguish, free from pain,
 Still blessing, and still blest. 
May balmy peace their mansion shield,
 And angels be their guard,
 May Heaven repeated blessings yield,
 Their virtues to reward.
