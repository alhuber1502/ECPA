sonnet [34] xxxiv. to a friend. 

charm by thy suffrage, shall i yet aspire,
 (all inauspicious as my fate appear,
 by trouble darken, that increase with year,)
 to guide the crayon, or to touch the lyre? 
ah i! â€” the sister muse still require
 a spirit free from all intrusive fear,
 nor will they deign to wipe away the tear
 of vain regret, that dim their sacred fire. 
but when thy envy sanction crown my lay,
 a ray of pleasure light my languid mind,
 for well i know the value of thy praise;
 and to how few, the flatter meed confine,
 that thou, their high favour brow to bind,
 will weave green myrtle and unfading bay!
