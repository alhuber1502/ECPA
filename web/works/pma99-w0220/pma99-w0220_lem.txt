write in Ireland.

how bless will be iërne isle,
 be bigotry and all it be guile
 chace as a cloud away;
 then will religion rear her head,
 and sweet contentment round she spread,
 like a new dawn of day. 

come then, oh come, thou truth divine! 
with double radiance deign to shine,
 thy heavenly light expand;
 it be thy to chase these cloud of night,
 which darken and confound the sight
 in this divide land. 

attendant on thy prosperous train
 i see sweet peace with honest gain
 spread wide her liberal hand,
 while discord, mask deep disguise,
 abash from forth her presence fly,
 strike by her magic wand. 

around, where now in ruin lie
 thy sacred altar, i espy
 fair order rear each pile,
 while over thy wild forlorn and waste,
 lo, industry with nimble haste
 make hill and valley smile. 

no more thy son in fell despite,
 a murderous band array in white,
 shall deal destruction round;
 each man beneath his vine shall rest,
 no more by bigotry oppress,
 but truth by peace be crown. 

then shall iërne tune her lyre,
 and with unite voice conspire
 to hail her happy state;
 all hail, iërne, nature pride,
 no more shall war thy land divide,
 be thou as good as great.
