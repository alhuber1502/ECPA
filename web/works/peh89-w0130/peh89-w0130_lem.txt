perplexity.

a poem.

you tender young virgin attend to my lay,
 my heart be divide in twain;
 my Collin be beautiful, witty, and gay,
 and damon a kind-hearted swain. 

whenever my lovely young Collin i meet,
 what pleasure arise in my breast;
 the dear gentle swain look so charm and sweet,
 i fancy i love he the best. 

but when my dear Damon do to i complain,
 so tender, so love and kind,
 my bosom be soften to hear the fond swain,
 and Collin slip out of my mind. 

whenever my Damon repeat his soft tale,
 my heart overflow with delight;
 but when my dear Collin appear in the vale,
 i languish away at the sight. 

it be Collin alone shall possess my fond heart,
 now Damon for ever adieu;
 but can i? â€” i can from Damon thus part! 
he be love i so long, and so true. 

my heart to my Damon i will instant bind,
 and on he will fix all my care;
 but, o shall i be to my Collin unkind,
 he sure will die with despair. 

how happy, how happy with Damon i will be,
 if Collin i never have know;
 as happy with Collin, if i will never see
 my Damon, so tender and true.
