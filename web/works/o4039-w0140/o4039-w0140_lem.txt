on mr. Alcock, of Bristol,

a excellent miniature painter.

you nine, awake the chord shell,
 while i the praise of Alcock tell
 in truth-dictated lay:
 on wing of genius take thy flight,
 o muse! above the Olympic height,
 make echo sing his praise. 

nature in all her glory dress,
 her flowery crown, her verdant vest,
 her zone etherial blue,
 receive new charm from alcock hand;
 the eye survey, at his command,
 whole kingdom at a view. 

his beauty seem to roll the eye,
 and bid the real arrow fly,
 to wound the gazer mind;
 so take be his man display,
 that oft the unguarded wound maid,
 have wish the painter blind. 

his picture like to nature show,
 the silver fountain seem to flow;
 the hoary wood to nod:
 the curl hair, the flow dress,
 the speak attitude, confess
 the fancy form god. 

you classic roman-loving fool,
 say, can the painter of the school,
 with alcock pencil vie? 
he paint the passion of mankind,
 and in the face display the mind,
 charm the heart and eye. 

thrice happy artist, rouse thy power,
 and send, in wonder-giving shower,
 thy beauteous work to view:
 envy shall sicken at thy name,
 italian leave the chair of fame,
 and own the seat thy due.
