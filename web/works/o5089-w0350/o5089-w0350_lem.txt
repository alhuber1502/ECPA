winifreda.

away; let nought to love displease,
 my winifreda, move your care;
 let nought delay the heavenly blessing,
 nor squeamish pride, nor gloomy fear. 

what though no grant of royal donor
 with pompous title grace our blood? 
we will shine in more substantial honour,
 and to be noble we will be good. 

our name, while virtue thus we tender,
 will sweet sound wherever it be speak:
 and all the great one, they shall wonder
 how they respect such little folk. 

what though from fortune lavish bounty
 no mighty treasure we possess,
 we will find within our pittance plenty,
 and be content without excess. 

still shall each return season
 sufficient for our wish give;
 for we will live a life of reason,
 and that be the only life to live. 

through youth and age in love excel,
 we will hand in hand together tread;
 sweet smile peace shall crown our dwelling,
 and babe, sweet-smiling babe, our bed. 

how shall i love the pretty creature,
 while round my knee they fond cling;
 to see they look their mother feature,
 to hear they lisp their mother tongue. 

and when with envy time transport,
 shall think to rob we of our joy,
 you will in your girl again be court,
 and i will go a woo in my boy.
