[I thank thee God, that I have lived]

I thank thee God, that I have lived
 In this great world and known its many joys:
 The songs of birds, the strong sweet scent of hay,
 And cooling breezes in the secret dusk;
 The flaming sunsets at the close of day,
 Hills and the lovely, heather-covered moors;
 Music at night, and moonlight on the sea,
 The beat of waves upon the rocky shore
 And wild white spray, flung high in ecstasy;
 The faithful eyes of dogs, and treasured books,
 The love of Kin and fellowship of friends
 And all that makes life dear and beautiful. 

I thank Thee too, that there has come to me
 A little sorrow and sometimes defeat,
 A little heartache and the loneliness
 That comes with parting and the words 'Good-bye';
 Dawn breaking after weary hours of pain,
 When I discovered that night's gloom must yield
 And morning light break through to me again. 
Because of these and other blessings poured
 Unasked upon my wondering head,
 Because I know that there is yet to come
 An even richer and more glorious life,
 And most of all, because Thine only Son
 Once sacrificed life's loveliness for me,
 I thank Thee, God, that I have lived.
