[i thank thou god, that i have live]

i thank thou god, that i have live
 in this great world and know its many joy:
 the song of bird, the strong sweet scent of hay,
 and cool breeze in the secret dusk;
 the flame sunset at the close of day,
 hill and the lovely, heather-covered moor;
 music at night, and moonlight on the sea,
 the beat of wave upon the rocky shore
 and wild white spray, fling high in ecstasy;
 the faithful eye of dog, and treasure book,
 the love of kin and fellowship of friend
 and all that make life dear and beautiful. 

i thank thou too, that there have come to i
 a little sorrow and sometime defeat,
 a little heartache and the loneliness
 that come with part and the word 'good-bye';
 dawn break after weary hour of pain,
 when i discover that night gloom must yield
 and morning light break through to i again. 
because of these and other blessing pour
 unasked upon my wonder head,
 because i know that there be yet to come
 a even rich and more glorious life,
 and most of all, because thy only son
 once sacrifice life loveliness for i,
 i thank thou, god, that i have live.
