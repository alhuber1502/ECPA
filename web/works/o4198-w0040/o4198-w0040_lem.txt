acrostic on miss [Eleanor Hoyland].

1768. 

enchant be the mighty power of love;
 life strip of amorous joy will irksome prove;
 even heaven great thunderer wore 'easy chain,
 and over all the world, love keep his reign;
 no human heart can bear the pierce blade,
 or i than other, be more tender make. 
right through my heart a burn arrow drive,

hoyland bright eye, be make the bow of love. 
oh! torture, inexpressible severe! 
you be the please author of my care;
 look down, fair angel, on a Swain distress,
 a gracious smile from you will make i bless. 
nothing but that bless favour still my grief,
 death, that deny, will quick give relief.
