ACROSTIC ON MISS [ELEANOR HOYLAND].

1768.

ENCHANTING is the mighty power of Love;
 Life stript of amorous joys would irksome prove;
 Ev'n Heaven's great Thund'rer woreth 'easy chain,
 And over all the world, Love keeps his reign;
 No human heart can bear the piercing blade,
 Or I than others, am more tender made. 
Right thro' my heart a burning arrow drove,

Hoyland's bright eyes, were made the bows of Love. 
Oh! torture, inexpressibly severe! 
You are the pleasing Author of my care;
 Look down, fair Angel, on a Swain distrest,
 A gracious smile from you would make me blest. 
Nothing but that blest favour stills my grief,
 Death, that denied, will quickly give relief.
