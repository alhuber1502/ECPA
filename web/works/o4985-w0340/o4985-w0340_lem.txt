ode to the Muse.

by the same.

i 1. 

yet once more, sweet queen of song,
 thy humble suppliant lead along,
 through fancy flowery plain:
 oh bear i to the ideal grove,
 where hand in hand the grace rove,
 and sooth i with seraphic strain! 
it be thy, harmonious maid, to cull
 delicious balm to heal our care;
 it be thy to take the prison soul,
 and lap it in elysian air;
 while quick as think at thy divine command
 the realm of grace and harmony expand. 

i 2. 

and lo! before my ravish eye
 the visionary scene arise! 
i hear the tender lute complain,
 while Sappho breathe her amorous pain;
 (o guard i from such fierce desire,
 thou god of rapture, god of fire!) 
i hear anacreon honeyed tongue
 to love and wine repeat the song;
 his flight sublime the theban swan prepare,
 and loud music wake the wonder sphere. 

i 3. 

but hark! how sweet the number swell,
 while Homer wave his soul-enchanting wand! 
entranced the listen passion stand,
 charm with the magic of his shell. 
whether to arm his trump resound,
 the heart with martial ardor bound;
 or sprightly theme his hand employ,
 instant we catch the spread joy;
 or when in note majestic, deep, and slow,
 he bid the solemn stream of sorrow flow,
 amaze we hear the sadly-pleasing strain,
 while tender anguish steal through every vein. 

ii. 1. 

father of verse, who eagle flight
 fatigue the gazer ache sight,
 and strain the aspire mind:
 teach i thy wondrous height to view,
 with tremble wing thy step pursue,
 and leave the lessen world behind. 
fond, foolish wish! — can human eye
 the rapid arrow track descry? 
can gross mortality arise,
 and spring beyond the vault sky? 
lose be the momentary path, and bind
 by cumbrous chain we creep along the ground! 

ii. 2. 

yet some there be with power endow
 to soar above the grovel crowd;
 by thou, fair fancy, rapturous maid,
 by thou, o sweet enthusiast, lead,
 sublime beyond the milky way
 with strong seraphic plume they stray;
 or pierce within the sacred shade,
 where nature plastic form be lay;
 then strike with dare hand the magic string,
 and warm to life a new creation spring. 

ii. 3. 

hail choose few, who happy birth
 the muse behold, and bad your due foot climb
 fame slippery hill, and path sublime,
 untrod by vulgar son of earth! 
when virtue droop, all sick and pale,
 in bleak misfortune desert vale,
 it be you to steal away her care,
 and soft sooth the pensive fair:
 it be you to cull from fancy fairy store,
 the bright gem, and sweetest-breathing flower. 
then bind with daedal art such wreath divine,
 as bloom secure on truth be immortal shrine. 

iii. 1. 

haste then! — for soft etesian gale
 supply the pilot welcome sail,
 and waft he over the main:
 and gentle shower, the daughter fair
 of pregnant cloud, and balmy air,
 rejoice the faint, and thirsty plain:
 o haste, your sweet number shed,
 fraught with the genial dew of praise,
 on glory favourite son, who tread
 unwearied danger thorny maze;
 who tear fresh laurel from war ghastly brow,
 or steer the steadfast bark, though tide of faction flow. 

iii. 2. 

but, o you delegate of Jove,
 send from the starry realm above
 to guard the clime, with dragon eye,
 when all the muse treasure rise,
 shall gothic ignorance invade
 with lawless foot the virgin shade,
 and too incontinent presume
 rash to pluck the golden bloom;
 wide wave the flame sword, and send, o send
 your bright shaft to quell the Stygian fiend! 

iii. 3. 

with holy dread, you guardian of her store,
 fulfil your charge, not too profuse of praise
 embalm, with her immortal lay,
 the carrion corps of pride, or power! 
let dullness her vain favour shed
 on smile folly kindred head;
 or vice, in tinsel trappings dress,
 promote the wretch who flatter best;
 disdain the crew! — and in some distant grove,
 to worth afflict, friendless, raise your voice;
 so shall the muse your honest song approve,
 and deathless fame reward your uncorrupted choice!
