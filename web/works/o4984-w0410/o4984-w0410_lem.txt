on the death of his wife.

by the same.

take, holy earth, all that my soul hold dear;
 take that best gift which heaven so late give:
 to bristol fount i bear with tremble care
 her fade form; she bow to taste the wave,

and die. do youth, do beauty read the line? 
do sympathetic fear their breast alarm? 
speak, dead Maria, breathe a strain divine,
 even from the grave thou shall have power to charm. 

bid they be chaste, be innocent like thou;
 bid they in duty sphere as meek move;
 and if so fair, from vanity so free,
 so firm in friendship, and so fond in love;

tell they, though it be a awful thing to die,
 (it be even to thou) yet the dread path once tread,
 heaven lift its everlasting portal high,
 and bid the pure in heart behold their god.
