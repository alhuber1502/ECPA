the cruel parent.

a dream.

it be when the sun have his swift progress make,
 and leave his empire to the queen of shade;
 bright Cynthia too, with her refulgent train,
 shoot their pale lustre over the dewy plain:
 sit lonely Mira with her head recline,
 and mourn the sorrow of her helpless kind:
 then to her fancy celia woe appear,
 the nymph, who tale deserve a pity tear;
 who early beauty meet a swift decay;
 a rose that fade at the rise day,
 while grief and shame oppress her tender age,
 pursue by famine and a father rage;
 till too much think the ache heart oppress. 
and mira eye-lid close in silent rest:
 then active fancy, with her airy train,
 compose the substance of the ensue dream. 

in a black shade my wander self i find,
 a wood encircle by a thorny bind;
 where oak upraise their kingly head on high,
 and the please linnet through the branch fly:
 there lofty elm the wonder sky invade,
 and the dark cypress cast a brown shade:
 grave laurel there the humble shrub overlook;
 there the pale ash, and there the poplar shake;
 here pliant elder who her fruit adorn,
 and the brown hasel weave with shagged thorn:
 rude brier there their clasp tendrel twine,
 who rugged arm with useless rose shine. 

beyond the confine of the dusky brake,
 a plain be bound with a putrid lake,
 where plank of timber stretch on moulder beam,
 form a weak passage over the stand stream,
 who slimy water to its arch cling,
 where wrap in weed the clod vermin hang,

on this brown plain surround by the wood,
 and the green lake — a age castle stand;
 who iron gate be strict shut to all,
 and frown roof hang over the crumble wall:
 here perch revenge and ever-wasting care,
 and melancholy with dishivele hair. 
before the portal wait a grisly band,
 fraud with a pencil in she shake hand:
 long scroll of parchment at her foot be lay,
 behind her shoulder stand her ghastly maid:
 oppression name — and stretch her filthy claw,
 and next pale avarice with insatiate maw;
 two cumbrous bag his twine arm enfold,
 of canker silver and of useless gold:
 grim he stand, and by his side appear
 fierce cruelty, all drench in orphan tear;
 within (attend by relentless hate)
 suspicion squint through the barbarous grate:
 to these rude door approach with bashful mien,
 soft Celia once the bright of the plain,
 but now the rose from her cheek be fly,
 nor can the fair one by her charm be know;
 those charm be now in sable weed array,
 her arm support by a mournful maid:
 from her wan eye the tear incessant flow,
 and all her form be penitence and woe. 

but see lysegus, her relentless sire,
 who eye-ball sparkle with disdainful ire;
 his potent hand the sound lock obey,
 with grate noise the horrid gate give way:
 then prostrate at his foot the damsel lie. 
three time to speak the lovely mourner try;
 thrice on her lip the faint murmur die;
 sigh follow sigh, and tear succeed to tear:
 at length she cry — ah! may lysegus hear;
 if nature or if penitence may sue,
 ah! let my sorrow find relief from you;
 the nightly star my constant wail know,
 the rise sun be witness to my woe:
 but who shall paint what wretched Celia feel,
 while shame and famine hunt her fly heel:
 the fool deride i, and the virtuous shun,
 then to the field and lonely shade i run;
 yet find no comfort from the lonely shade,
 at my approach the blossom seem to fade:
 i fly to wild unknown to human kind,
 but can leave my hate self behind;
 and be — oh be i — by my parent curse;
 of all my woe the deep and the worst:
 she say — lysegus answer in a rage,
 hence vile disturber of my luckless age:
 think not by tear this stubborn heart to win,
 nor jar my sense with thy hateful din:
 go learn of vagrant (fit companion) go,
 their art of steal and their whine of woe. 
yet when before the gate of pride you stand,
 and crave your morsel at the porter hand;
 may some stern slave prevent the come prize,
 throw to the dog before thy long eye:
 he cease — but Celia view no more the sun,
 for now her sorrow with her life be do:
 her eye no more afford their lucid stream,
 nor the pulse struggle in her quiet vein. 

the tyrant view she with a ghastly look,
 his heart beat heavy, and his sinew shake;
 when lo a spectre horrible to view,
 rise quick as vapour of a morning dew;
 who presence cast unpleasing darkness round,
 a cypress wreathe his fade temple crown:
 strange form be paint on his sable robe,
 one hand extend bear a crystal globe;
 where the pale sinner may his picture find,
 yet not his feature, but his dark mind:
 in vain to shun the faithful glass he try,
 it play unasked before his ache eye:
 his quick left hand with this perform its part,
 his right be dreadful with a poison dart:
 then with a loud and horrid voice he cry,
 lysegus, mourn thy cruelty and pride:
 from the fair court of equity i come,
 call by thy sin, and conscience be my name:
 this venom dart shall now thy entrails tear,
 and teach thy eye to know the melt tear:
 prepare thy spirit for their weight of woe,
 with celia name i arm the dreadful blow:
 he say and strike — the visionary dart
 seek the dark bottom of lysegus heart:
 he fall — and fall raise a fearful cry;
 then Mira awake, and find the morning sky.
