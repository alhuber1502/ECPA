to a sick friend.

though from the feeling heart be kindred tear,
and early friend, by chance or change, it mourn;
while it inhabit in this middle sphere,
where good and ill for ever mix appear.
not for itself, alone, it can survive;
support and support it will live;
feel its best joy in soothe other woe,
and will its own in some kind breast repose;
native affection still around it play,
and fond bind it to its fellow-clay.
best bliss of life, if joy they can diffuse,
and that seem dear which we fear to lose.

ah! be not part tie more mourn by i,
nor i, Eliza, doom to grieve for thou.
may health return, and still thy friendship bless;
and none who love i, leave i in my race.
deny by distance to my anxious sight,
i can cheer thy day, and watch thy night.
deny the tender care, by friendship teach,
i can give the salutary draught:
and anxious hope, and fear, and prayer be i,
till cheerful day, and health again be thy.
