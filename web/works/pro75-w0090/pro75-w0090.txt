A CHARACTER.

If a perfect form can please,
Join'd with innocence and ease,
Wit and eloquence refin'd,
Harmony and judgment join'd,
Meek and gentle to excess,
Neat and elegant in dress,
Charitable, free and gay,
Blooming as the month of May,
Foe to art and vanity,
From deceit and folly free,
Learned as a female ought,
Not by idle custom taught;
Grace in all her steps doth move,
Beauteous as the queen of love.
If such charms can please the sight,
Where all elegance unite,
Virtue, and fair truth divine,
The laurel, Juliet be thine.
