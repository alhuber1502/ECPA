song ii. the landskip.

how please within my native bower
erewhile i pass the day!
be ever scene so deck with flower?
be ever flower so gay?

how sweet smile the hill, the vale,
and all the landskip round!
the river glide down the dale!
the hill with beech crown!

but now, when urge by tender woe
i speed to meet my dear,
that hill and stream my zeal oppose,
and check my fond career.

no more, since Daphne be my theme,
their wonted charm i see:
that verdant hill, and silver stream,
divide my love and i.
