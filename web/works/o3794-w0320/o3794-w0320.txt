[Translation] 2. THE JACK DAW.

1.

THERE is a bird who by his coat,
 And by the hoarseness of his note,
 Might be suppós'd a crow;
 A great frequenter of the church,
 Where bishop-like he finds a perch,
 And dormitory too. 

2.

Above the steeple shines a plate,
 That turns and turns, to indicate
 From what point blows the weather;
 Look up — your brains begin to swim,
 'Tis in the clouds — that pleases him,
 He chooses it the rather. 

3.

Fond of the speculative height,
 Thither he wings his airy flight,
 And thence securely sees
 The bustle and the raree-show
 That occupy mankind below,
 Secure and at his ease. 

4.

You think no doubt he sits and muses
 On future broken bones and bruises,
 If he should chance to fall;
 No not a single thought like that
 Employs his philosophic pate,
 Or troubles it at all. 

5.

He sees that this great roundabout
 The world, with all its motley rout,
 Church, army, physic, law,
 Its customs and its businesses
 Are no concern at all of his,
 And says, what says he? Caw. 

6.

Thrice happy bird! I too have seen
 Much of the vanities of men,
 And sick of having seen e'm,
 Would chearfully these limbs resign
 For such a pair of wings as thine,
 And such a head between 'em.
