a acrostic upon a young woman, write by her lover. 

hail sweet charmer of the rural plain,
 accept the tribute of a humble swain;
 nor frown, though he presumptuous will essay;
 no muse your matchless beauty can display. 
all that be feign of the fair cyprian queen. 
here in this lovely damsel may be see. 
in her fair form be every grace combine;
 virtue and modesty adorn her mind. 
if Milton eloquence do grace my lay,
 sure it will fail, and speak but half her praise. 
o Cupid fix a arrow in her breast! 
no more i will wish, be i of she possess.
