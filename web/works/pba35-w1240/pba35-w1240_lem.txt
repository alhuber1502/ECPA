on the earl of Oxford and mortimer give his daughter in marriage in oxford-chapel.

see, in the temple raise by harley hand,
 his beauteous offspring at the altar stand:
 there Mortimer resign his darling care;
 to happy Portland give the bloom fair. 

where have the parent prayer like favour find? 
where soar so high, as from that sacred ground? 
what bosom, but devotion ardor feel,
 when, at the shrine he hallow, Harley kneel? 
at such a sight superior being please,
 to high note their hallelujah raise.
