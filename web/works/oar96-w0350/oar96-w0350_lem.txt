to Strephon.

to i his sigh, to i be all his vow,
 but there be my hell the depth of all my woe,
 we burn alike, but oh the distant bliss,
 a view of that my great torment be;
 accurse ambition, grovel interest,
 such heat crime as yet do never rest
 within my soul, must now unjust keep
 i from my heaven will they may sink as deep,
 as that black chaos whence they spring, and leave
 those mortal wretched which they now deceive.
