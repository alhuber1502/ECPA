to the same.

not every gem a diamond prove,
nor every bud a rose;
nor know we as life onward move,
what future day disclose.

fair Celia when a infant mild,
bright hope her dawn bespeak;
but oft the promise of the child,
maturer age have break.

in Celia numerous virtue shine,
each be at generous strife;
which most adorn we shall own,
in celia vary life.

and magnanimity be there,
and resignation mild;
that firm can she evil bear,
or through her tear they smile.

and see the generous virtue soar,
in celia happy day;
soft sympathy to help the poor,
and the deject raise.

hope which her infant spring have move,
meridian day disclose;
and every gem a diamond prove,
and every bud a rose.
