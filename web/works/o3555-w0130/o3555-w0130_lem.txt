[song] i 

come here fond youth, whoever thou be,
 that boast to love as well as i;
 and if thy breast have feel so wide a wound,
 come hither and thy flame approve;
 i will teach thou what it be to love,
 and by what mark true passion may be find. 

it be to be all bathe in tear;
 to live upon a smile for year;
 to lie whole age at a beauty foot:
 to kneel, to languish and implore;
 and still though she disdain, adore:
 it be to do all this, and think thy suffering sweet. 

it be to gaze upon her eye
 with eager joy and fond surprise;
 yet tempere with such chaste and awful fear
 as wretch feel who wait their doom;
 nor must one rude thought presume
 though but in whisper breathe, to meet her ear. 

it be to hope, though hope be lose;
 though heaven and earth thy passion cross;
 though she be bright as saint queen above,
 and thou the least and mean swain
 that fold his flock upon the plain,
 yet if thou dare not hope, thou do not love. 

it be to quench thy joy in tear;
 to nurse strange doubt and groundless fear:
 if pang of jealousy thou have not prove,
 though she be fond and more true
 than any nymph old poet draw,
 oh never dream again that thou have love. 

if when the darling maid be go,
 thou do not seek to be alone,
 wrap in a please trance of tender woe;
 and muse, and fold thy languid arm,
 feed thy fancy on her charm,
 thou do not love, for love be nourish so. 

if any hope thy bosom share
 but those which love have plant there,
 or any care but his thy breast enthrall,
 thou never yet his power have know;
 love sit on a despotic throne,
 and reign a tyrant, if he reign at all. 

now if thou be so lose a thing,
 here all thy tender sorrow bring,
 and prove who patience long can endure:
 we will strive who fancy shall be lose
 in dream of fond passion most;
 for if thou thus have love, oh! never hope a cure.
