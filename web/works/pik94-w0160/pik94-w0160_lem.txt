line for the blank leaf of my prayer book: write on a SUNDAY.

while wanderer, destine here on earth to stray,
 this sacred page will point the better way;
 it will soothe each care, it will cheerful faith impart,
 amend each error, and direct the heart;
 teach, with fair prospect not to be elate,
 nor faint sink beneath the frown of fate;
 nor ever murmur at what heaven deny,
 but think each cross a blessing in disguise. 
when pleasure maze display allure charm,
 when ill and danger spread their dire alarm,
 these line be by kind providence design
 to clear illusion, and compose the mind. 
all gracious power! vouchsafe to hear my prayer! 
guard i, and guide i with thy kind care:
 each rise morn sweet gratitude i will pay,
 for the dear blessing of this sacred day.
