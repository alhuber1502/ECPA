An EPIGRAM. 

On the Reverend Mr. LAURENCE ECHARD's, and Bishop GILBERT BURNET's Histories. 

By the Same.

GIL'S history appears to me
Political anatomy,
A case of skeletons well done,
And malefactors every one.
His sharp and strong incision pen
Historically cuts up men,
And does with lucid skill impart
Their inward ails of head and heart.
LAURENCE proceeds another way,
And well-dress'd figures doth display:
His characters are all in flesh,
Their hands are fair, their faces fresh;
And from his sweet'ning art derive
A better scent than when alive.
He wax-work made to please the sons,
Whose fathers were GIL'S skeletons.
