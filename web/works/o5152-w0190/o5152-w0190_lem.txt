a epigram. 

on the reverend mr. Laurence echard, and bishop Gilbert burnet's history. 

by the same.

gil history appear to i
political anatomy,
a case of skeleton well do,
and malefactor every one.
his sharp and strong incision pen
historically cut up man,
and do with lucid skill impart
their inward ail of head and heart.
Laurence proceed another way,
and well-dressed figure do display:
he character be all in flesh,
their hand be fair, their face fresh;
and from his sweeten art derive
a better scent than when alive.
he wax-work make to please the son,
who father be gil skeleton.
