ODE TO THE NEW YEAR, 1769.

BY MR. PETER CUNNINGHAME.

AQUARIUS rules the frozen skies,
 Deep frowning clouds on clouds arise,
 Fraught with the thunder's roar;
 With fury heaves the raging main,
 When foaming billows lash in vain
 The hoarse-resounding shore. 

No flowery vale now charms the eye;
 No tuneful warblers of the sky
 Now chear the lingering hours;
 No genial ray the groves illume,
 No zephyrs waft their mild perfume
 From sighs o'er vernal flowers. 

Tho' blooming scenes are now no more,
 That aid the raptur'd soul to soar,
 Poetic thoughts refine;
 Yet still the moralizing page
 To warm an unattentive age,
 These hoary scenes combine. 

With this I hail the opening year,
 Address the God, whose works appear
 Through each harmonious round;
 Who rules, serenely rules the storm,
 Who gave the lurid lightnings form,
 Whose thunders rock the ground. 

O Thou! alike where perfect day,
 In bright refulgent glories play,
 Around thy awful throne! 
When seraphs glow with sacred fires,
 When angels tune celestial lyres,
 To hymn thy praise alone! 

Still may thy providential care
 With blessings crown the rising year! 
Impending ills restrain! 
Thy wisdom guide my youthful Muse! 
Thy sacred eloquence diffuse,
 And consecrate my strain! 

While thus revolving seasons roll,
 Obsequious to thy wise controul,
 Obedient to thy plan;
 With silent eloquence they preach,
 The most important lessons teach,
 To cold unthinking man. 

Behold thyself reflected here! 
The Spring proclaims thine infant year,
 Gay life the Summer's bloom;
 Mild Autumn speaks maturer age,
 Confirms thee Fool, or hails thee Sage,
 While Winter shews the tomb. 

Or view the image of thy soul,
 As now the mountain surges roll,
 In wild tumultuous roar;
 Fit emblem of the wrathful mind,
 To Anger's tyrant sway consign'd,
 Where reason rules no more:

Unlike its placid form, serene,
 When Zephyr breathing o'er the scene,
 Sheds balmy peace around;
 Bless'd emblem of the conquering soul,
 Whose every passion knows controul,
 While conscious joys abound! 

That this may prove my bounteous share,
 Ascends my ever-constant prayer,
 To thee, all-perfect Mind;
 O aid me in the arduous strife,
 Through each perplexing maze of life,
 To all thy ways resign'd!
