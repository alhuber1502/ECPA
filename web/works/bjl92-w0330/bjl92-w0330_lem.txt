on the birth of J—. h—. ESQ.'s son. 

November 15, 1790. 

dear lovely babe, with heart elate,
 we hail thy natal hour:
 here do the muse impatient wait,
 libation kind to pour. 

upon a theme so new, so sweet,
 she now attempt to sing:
 no foreign aid she need invite,
 to touch the vocal string. 

but while with anxious thought on thou,
 and ardent look, i gaze,
 can i the valiant hero see,
 to animate my lay? 

the plod philosophic eye,
 shall i attempt to scan? 
or in thy infant smile descry
 the politician plan? 

too hard the task, my humble muse
 can boast of no such art;
 though hope, on flutter pinion do
 all this and more impart. 

while fondle by a mother kind,
 thou check the fall tear,
 when thy love father to her mind
 in every charm appear. 

his feature sweet, attractive, mild,
 each soft, each win grace,
 she do in thou, her darling child,
 with fond remembrance trace. 

and that the virtue he possess
 may in thy bosom glow,
 she do indulgent heaven request,
 who mitigate her woe. 

may he, on who her hope rely,
 protect thy lovely form,
 while sudden blast impetuous rise
 in life tempestuous storm. 

for thou, be calm the roll flood,
 be still the bluster wave:
 may thou be bless with every good
 a mother heart can crave.
