[fable  ] introduction to the fable. 

the shepherd and the philosopher.

remote from city live a Swain,
 unvexed with all the care of gain,
 his head be silvered over with age,
 and long experience make he sage;
 in summer heat and winter cold
 he feed his flock and pen the fold,
 his hour in cheerful labour fly,
 nor envy nor ambition know;
 his wisdom and his honest fame
 through all the country raise his name. 

a deep philosopher (who rule
 of moral life be draw from school)
 the shepherd homely cottage seek,
 and thus explore his reach of thought. 

whence be thy learning? have thy toil
 over book consume the midnight oil? 
have thou old Greece and Rome survey,
 and the vast sense of Plato weigh? 
have Socrates thy soul refine,
 and have thou fathome tully mind? 
or, like the wise Ulysses throw
 by various fate on realm unknown,
 have thou through many city stray,
 their custom, law and manner weigh? 

the shepherd modest reply. 
i never the path of learning try,
 nor have i roam in foreign part
 to read mankind, their law and art;
 for man be practise in disguise,
 he cheat the most discern eye:
 who by that search shall wise grow,
 when we ourselves can never know? 
the little knowledge, i have gain,
 be all from simple nature drain;
 hence my life maxim take their rise,
 hence grow my settle hate to vice. 

the daily labour of the bee
 awake my soul to industry. 
who can observe the careful ant,
 and not provide for future want? 
my dog (the trusty of his kind)
 with gratitude inflame my mind;
 i mark his true, his faithful way,
 and in my service copy tray. 
in constancy, and nuptial love
 i learn my duty from the dove. 
the hen, who from the chilly air
 with pious wing protect her care,
 and every fowl that fly at large
 instruct i in a parent charge. 

from nature too i take my rule
 to shun contempt and ridicule. 
i never with important air
 in conversation overbear:
 can grave and formal pass for wise,
 when man the solemn owl despise? 
my tongue within my lip i rein,
 for who talk much must talk in vain;
 we from the wordy torrent fly:
 who listen to the chatter pie? 
nor will i with felonious slight
 by stealth invade my neighbour right;
 rapacious animal we hate:
 kite, hawk and wolf deserve their fate. 
do not we just abhorrence find
 against the toad and serpent kind? 
but envy, calumny and spite
 bear strong venom in their bite. 
thus every object of creation
 can furnish hint to contemplation,
 and from the most minute and mean
 a virtuous mind can moral glean. 

thy fame be just, the sage reply,
 thy virtue prove thou true wise;
 pride often guide the author pen,
 book as affect be as man,
 but he who study nature law
 from certain truth his maxim draw,
 and those, without our school, suffice
 to make man moral, good and wise.
