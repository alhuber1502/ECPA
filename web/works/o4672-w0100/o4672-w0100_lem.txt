sincere praise.

i 

almighty maker god!
 how wondrous be thy name! 
thy glory how diffuse abroad
 through the creation frame! 

ii.

nature in every dress
 her humble homage pay,
 and take a thousand way to express
 thy undissembled praise. 

iii.

in native white and red
 the rose and Lilly stand,
 and free from pride their beauty spread
 to show thy skilful hand. 

iv.

the lark mount up the sky
 with unambitious song,
 and bear her maker praise on high
 upon her artless tongue. 

v. 

my soul will rise and sing
 to her creator too,
 fain will my tongue adore my king,
 and pay the worship due. 

vi.

but pride that busy sin
 spoil all that i perform,
 curse pride, that creep secure in,
 and swell a haughty worm. 

vii.

thy glory i abate,
 or praise thou with design;
 some of thy favour i forget,
 or will have something mine. 

viii.

the very song i frame
 be faithless to thy cause,
 and steal the honour of thy name
 unto their own applause. 

ix.

create my soul anew,
 else all my worship vain;
 this wretched heart will never be true
 until it be form again. 

x. 

descend celestial fire,
 and seize i from above,
 melt i in flame of pure desire
 a sacrifice to love. 

xi.

let joy and worship spend
 the remnant of my day,
 and to my god my soul ascend
 in sweet perfume of praise.
