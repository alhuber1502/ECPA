Sincere Praise.

I.

ALmighty Maker God!
 How wondrous is thy Name! 
Thy Glories how diffus'd abroad
 Thro' the Creations Frame! 

II.

Nature in every Dress
 Her humble Homage Pays,
 And takes a Thousand Ways t' express
 Thine Undissembled Praise. 

III.

In Native White and Red
 The Rose and Lilly stand,
 And free from Pride their Beauties spread
 To show thy skilful Hand. 

IV.

The Lark mounts up the Sky
 With Unambitious Song,
 And bears her Maker's Praise on high
 Upon her Artless Tongue. 

V.

My Soul would rise and Sing
 To her Creator too,
 Fain would my Tongue adore my King,
 And Pay the Worship due. 

VI.

But Pride that busie Sin
 Spoils all that I perform,
 Curs'd Pride, that creeps securely in,
 And swells a haughty Worm. 

VII.

Thy Glories I abate,
 Or praise thee with Design;
 Some of thy Favours I forget,
 Or would have something mine. 

VIII.

The very Songs I frame
 Are Faithless to thy Cause,
 And steal the Honours of thy Name
 Unto their own Applause. 

IX.

Create my Soul anew,
 Else all my Worship's vain;
 This wretched Heart will ne'er be true
 Until 'tis form'd again. 

X.

Descend Celestial Fire,
 And seize me from above,
 Melt me in Flames of pure Desire
 A Sacrifice to Love. 

XI.

Let Joy and Worship spend
 The Remnant of my Days,
 And to my God my Soul ascend
 In sweet Perfumes of Praise.
