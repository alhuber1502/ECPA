saint Luke vii. 12. 

in silent sorrow from the gate of nain,
 bear their dead, the widow only son,
 a band of friend go forth; and with that train
 even she, the most bereave, move sad on. 

but when the lord behold the piteous sight,
 he have compassion on she; from he break
 soft tenderness of soul, with save might,
 and "weep not" be the gracious word he speak. 

in deep affliction it be that voice we hear,
 when pity, helpless friend keep silence round:
 weep not! there be save power, there be comfort near,
 that will even in the dark hour be find. 

it be a hour of dark, deep woe,
 when those we love be sever from our side,
 yet weep not, for we soon and sure go
 upon their step, lead by the same bless guide. 

it be a darken hour, when evil fame
 and evil fortune mingle in our lot;
 yet weep not, he, who scorn, rebuke and shame,
 bear for our worthless sake, desert we not. 

it be a hour of darkness, when the soul,
 she know not why, dread a impend doom,
 while heaven and earth, seem one black, formless scroll,
 but weep not, light will yet break through the gloom. 

poor soul! he who behold the widow grief,
 and touch the bier, and from death band set free
 her only son, have for all woe relief,
 and "weep not" be the word he speak to thou.
