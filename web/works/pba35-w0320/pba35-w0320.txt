An Hymn to Sleep.

Written when the Author was sick.

Somnus, pow'rful Deity,
 Mortals owe their Bliss to thee. 
How long shall I thy Absence mourn,
 And when be bless'd in thy Return? 
Relentless God! why will you flee,
 And take Delight to torture me:
 Or do you kindly flight my Pray'r,
 To make me for my Change prepare? 
'Tis well this Happiness remains;
 When you resuse to ease our Pains,
 Your Brother Death your Place supplies,
 And kindly seals the Wretch's Eyes.
