a hymn to sleep.

write when the author be sick.

Somnus, powerful deity,
 mortal owe their bliss to thou. 
how long shall i thy absence mourn,
 and when be bless in thy return? 
relentless god! why will you flee,
 and take delight to torture i:
 or do you kindly flight my prayer,
 to make i for my change prepare? 
it be well this happiness remain;
 when you refuse to ease our pain,
 your brother death your place supply,
 and kind seal the wretch eye.
