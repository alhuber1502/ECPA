to miss LUCY Fâ€”

by the same.

once by the muse alone inspire,
i sing my amorous strain:
no serious love my bosom fire;
yet every tender maid deceive
the idle mournful tale believe,
and weep my fancy pain,

but Venus now to punish i,
for have feign so well,
have make my heart so fond of thou,
that not the whole aonian choir
can accent soft enough inspire,
its real flame to tell.
