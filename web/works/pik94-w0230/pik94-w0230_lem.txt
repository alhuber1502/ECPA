answer to the song of 'trust not man,' etc. 

i will not trust, nor man deceive i,
 i will elude his deep art;
 he shall wed and be deserve,
 before i give my much love heart. 

i do want thou kind adviser,
 man shall never i perplex;
 i shall still continue prudent,
 and defy the faithless sex. 

i never trust a artful story,
 ever to my heart take heed;
 to i they shall be always humble,
 or they never shall succeed. 

nor like a bird i will be delude,
 virtue still shall guard my heart;
 until i find a faithful lover,
 it and i shall never part.
