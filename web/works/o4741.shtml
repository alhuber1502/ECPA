I have indeed but a poor Defence to make for the Things I have wrote: I don't think them good, and better Judges will doubtless think worse of them than I do. Only this, I believe, I may say of them, That, if they have nothing to delight those who may<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e2316">[Page viii]</span> chance to read them, they have nothing to give Modesty a Blush; if nothing to entertain and improve the Mind, they have nothing to debauch and corrupt it.</p><p>ANOTHER Motive, that I hope may in duce the Reader to overlook the Defects in this Volume, is, That the oldest Poem in it is little more than six Years of Age; and a considerable Part of the Time since that was writ, has been spent in endeavouring to learn a Language, of which I was then intirely ignorant; tho' I fear, the few Attempts I have made in Translations, will too well convince the Public, to how little Purpose I have employ'd my Time. I confess myself guilty of a great Presumption in publish ing Imitations of <span class="hi">HORACE,</span> when many eminent Hands have done it much better before me: But when I was only endeavouring to understand him, I found it difficult to conquer a Temptation I had to imitate some of his Thoughts, which mightily pleas'd me. If I may be forgiven this Experiment, I promise to trouble the World with nothing of this Nature again, at least, till I may be able to do my Author more Justice.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e3201">[Page ix]</span><p>I have not myself been so fond of writing, as might be imagin'd from seeing so many Things of mine as are got together in this Book. Se veral of them are on Subjects that were given me by Persons, to whom I have such great Ob ligations, that I always thought their Desires Commands. My want of <span class="hi">Education</span> will be too evident from them, for me to mention it here: And I hope, when the Reader weighs my Performances, he will put <span class="hi">that,</span> and other Disadvantages into the Scale.</p><p>I am afraid, the Letter relating to myself, wrote by a worthy and learned Gentleman, will be thought an improper Thing in a Publication made by myself: But, as I was desir'd to prefix it, by Persons whom I think it an Honour to obey, I hope it will be pardon'd; and the rather, because a very false Account had been publish'd before, by a Person who seems to have had as little Regard for Truth, as he had for Honesty, when he stole my Poems.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e3989">[Page x]</span><p>I would willingly here make known my Obli gations to those worthy Persons who first took notice of me in the midst of <span class="hi">Poverty</span> and <span class="hi">La bour,</span> were I not afraid, my Gratitude, thus publicly express'd, would offend them more than my Silence. However, I must beg leave to re turn my Thanks to a Reverend Gentleman of <span class="hi">Wiltshire,</span> and to another of <span class="hi">Winchester:</span> The former made my Life more comfortable, as soon as he knew me; the latter, after giving me several Testimonies of his Bounty and Good ness, presented my first Essays to a Lady of Quality, attending on the Queen, who made my low Circumstances known to Her <span class="hi">Majesty. </span></p><p>I hope too, that all those Honourable Per sons, whose <span class="hi">Names</span> do me so much Credit at the Beginning of my Book, will accept my Ac knowledgments and Thanks for so liberal a Subscription: And as this Volume, I fear, will tell them, they have not encourag'd a Poet, I will endeavour to let them see they have been generous to an honest Man.</p></section></div><li><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-4">AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR, In a LETTER to a FRIEND.</a></li><div class="collapse" id="collapse-4"><section class="biography" id="index.xml-front.1_div.4"><header><h1><span class="head">AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR, In a LETTER to a FRIEND.</span></h1></header><div class="opener"><div class="dateline">Written in the Year <span class="date">1730.</span></div><div class="salute">SIR,</div></div><p><span class="decorInit">I</span> Don't wonder that you should desire so distinct an Account, how <span class="hi">Stephen Duck</span> came to write Verses, and how he manag'd in writing them. Philosophers find as much Subject for their Admiration in the minutest Bodies, as in the largest; and a Poet from the Barn, tho' not so great a Man, is as great a Curiosity, as a Dictator from the Plow. I can be particular enough as to his first setting out in Poetry; and, since you seem to desire it, shall give you all the Cir cumstances I could learn from a Week's Conversation with him in all his Simplicity; without considering, that many of them, to a Person less curi ous, might appear too trifling to be mention'd even in a Letter.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e5433">[Page xii]</span><p>MY Friend <span class="hi">Stephen</span> had originally no other Teaching, than what enabled him to read, and write <span class="hi">English</span>; he had never taken a single Step toward any other Language. As Arithmetic is generally join'd with this Degree of Learning, he had a little Share of that too. About his Fourteenth Year he was taken from School, and was afterwards successively engag'd in the se veral lowest Employments of a Country Life. This lasted for some Years; so long, that he had forgot almost all the Arithmetic he had learn'd at School: However he read sometimes, and thought oftener. He had a cer tain Longing after Knowledge; and when he reflected within himself on his want of Education, he began to be particularly uneasy, that he should have forgot something of what he had learnt, even at the little School he had been at. He thought of this so often, that at last he resolv'd to try his own Strength; and, if possible, to recover his Arithmetic again.</p><p>HIS first Attempt of this kind I take to have been about Six Years ago. Considering the Difficulties the poor Fellow lay under, this Inclination for Knowledge must have been very strong in him. He was then marry'd, and at Service; he had little Time to spare; he had no Books, and no Money to get any: But he was resolv'd to go thro' with it; and accordingly us'd to work more than other Day-labourers, and by that means got some little matter added to his Pay. This Overplus was at his own Disposal. With this he bought first a Book of Vulgar Arithmetic, then one of Decimal, and a third of Measuring of Land; all which by degrees he made himself a to lerable Master of, in those Hours he could steal from his Sleep, after the Labours of the Day.</p><p>WHERE there was such a Desire for Knowledge, there must be good Sense at bottom, and a Soul, at least, somewhat above the common Con versation he must meet with in his poor State of Life. I have ask'd him, whom he had that he could talk and converse with in the Country; and was pleas'd to find him, in this Particular, happier than I expected. He said, he had one dear Friend, that he mention'd with uncommon Affection. They us'd to talk and read together, when they could steal a little Time for it. This Friend had been in a Service at <span class="hi">London</span> for two or three Years: He had an Inclination to Books; he had purchas'd some, and brought 'em down with him into the Country; and <span class="hi">Stephen</span> had always the Use of his little Library; which by this Time, possibly, may be increas'd to two or three dozen of Books. This Friend knew no more out of <span class="hi">English</span> than <span class="hi">Stephen</span>; but by talking together they mutually improv'd each other. <span class="hi">Ste phen</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e7595">[Page xiii]</span> is all Simplicity: He says,<span class="q"> "That his Friend can talk better than he, as having been more us'd to Company; but that he himself has been more us'd to Poetry, and in that can do better than his Friend."</span></p><p>HAD it not been for this, <span class="hi">Stephen</span> must have been plac'd in the same Class with <span class="hi">Hai Ebn Yokdhan,</span> and the young <span class="hi">Hermes</span> in Mr. <span class="hi">Ramsay's</span> <span class="hi">Cyrus:</span> But the Story of their Improvements without any Assistance agrees only with Romances; and you know, what I am writing to you is a true History. Our retir'd Philosopher had his Friend; and it seems to have been the greatest Happiness of his Life, that he had one. They did not only read, but reason'd over Points together; and I have sometimes thought, how agreeable a thing it would have been, to have been conceal'd within hearing of them, when they were in the midst of some of their most knotty Debates. We may imagine 'em both to have had good natural Sense, and a few good Books in common between 'em: Their Minds were their own; neither improv'd, nor spoil'd, by laying in a Stock of Learning: They were perhaps equally well inclin'd to learn, both struggling for a little Knowledge; and, like a Couple of Rowers on the same Bottom, while they were only striving perhaps, which should out do his Companion, they were really each helping the other, and driving the Boat on the faster.</p><p>PERHAPS you would be willing to know what Books their little Library consisted of. I need not mention those of Arithmetic again, nor his Bible: <span class="hi">Milton,</span> the <span class="hi">Spectators,</span> and <span class="hi">Seneca,</span> were his first Favourites; <span class="hi">Telemachus,</span> with another Piece by the same Hand, and <span class="hi">Addison's</span> Defence of Christia nity, his next. They had an <span class="hi">English</span> Dictionary, and a sort of <span class="hi">English</span> Grammar, an <span class="hi">Ovid</span> of long Standing with them, and a <span class="hi">Bysshe's</span> Art of Po etry of later Acquisition: <span class="hi">Seneca's</span> Morals had made the Name of <span class="hi">L'Estrange</span> dear to them; and, as I imagine, might occasion their getting his <span class="hi">Josephus</span> in Folio, which was the largest Purchace in their Collection: They had one Volume of <span class="hi">Shakespear</span> with Seven of his Plays in it. Beside these, <span class="hi">Stephen</span> had read Three or Four other Plays; some of <span class="hi">Epictetus, Waller, Dryden's</span> <span class="hi">Virgil, Prior, Hudibras, Tom Brown,</span> and the <span class="hi">London Spy. </span>You may see I am a faithful Historian, by my giving you the Bad with the Good.</p><p>WITH these Helps <span class="hi">Stephen</span> is grown something of a Poet, and some thing of a Philosopher. I find by him, that from his Infancy, he has had a Cast in his Mind toward Poetry. He has delighted, as far back as he can remember, in Verses, and in Singing. He speaks of strange Emotions, that he has felt on the top Performances of the little Choir of Songsters in<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e9772">[Page xii]</span><span class="gap" title="duplicate">〈1 page duplicate〉</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e9776">[Page xiii]</span><span class="gap" title="duplicate">〈1 page duplicate〉</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e9780">[Page xiv]</span>a Country Chancel; and mentions his first hearing of an Organ, as a re markable Epocha of his Life. He seems to be a pretty good Judge too of a musical Line; but I imagine, that he does not hear Verses in his own Mind, as he repeats them. I don't know whether you understand me. I mean, that his Ideas of the Notes in a Verse, and his Manner of repeating the same Verse, are often different: For he points out an harmonious Line well enough; and yet he generally spoils its Harmony by his way of speaking it.</p><p>WHAT first gave him a higher Taste of Poetry, than he had been us'd to, was <span class="hi">Milton's</span> <span class="hi">Paradise Lost. </span>This came oddly enough into his Hands; and when I see you, I'll tell you the History of it. <span class="hi">Stephen</span> read it over twice or thrice with a Dictionary, before he could understand the Language of it thoroughly. This, and a sort of <span class="hi">English</span> Grammar they had, have been of the greatest Use to him of any thing.</p><p>INDEED it seems plain to me, that he has got <span class="hi">English</span> just as we get <span class="hi">Latin. </span>He study'd <span class="hi">Paradise Lost,</span> as others study the Classics. The new Beauties in that Poem, that were continually opening upon his Mind, made all his Labour easy to him. He work'd all Day for his Master; and, after the Labour of the Day, set to his Books at Night. The Pains he has taken for the Pleasure of improving himself, are incredible; but it has answer'd too beyond what one could have expected; for he seems to understand some of the great and deeper Beauties of that Poem tolerably well; and points out several particular Beauties in it, which it requires a good nice Eye to discover.</p><p>'TWAS his Friend that help'd him to the <span class="hi">Spectators</span>; they read them often together, and often by themselves. <span class="hi">Stephen</span> tells me, that he has frequently carry'd them with him to his Work. When he did so, his Method was to labour harder than any body else, that he might get half an Hour to read a <span class="hi">Spectator,</span> without injuring his Master. By this means he us'd to sit down all over Sweat and Heat, without regarding his own Health, and often to the Prejudice of it. If this affects you, as it has me, I ought not to pass it over, that you may not lose the Pleasure of so strong an Instance of Honesty and Industry mix'd together.</p><p>THE <span class="hi">Spectators</span> improv'd his Understanding, he says, more than any thing. The Copies of Verses, scatter'd in those Pieces, help'd on his natural Bent that way; and made him willing to try, whether he could not do something like 'em. He sometimes turn'd his own Thoughts into Verse, while he<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e11886">[Page xv]</span> was at Work; and at last begun to venture those Thoughts a little on Paper. What he did of this kind, was very inconsiderable; only scatter'd Thoughts, and generally not above four or five Lines on the same Subject; which, as there was nobody thereabouts that car'd for Verses, nor any body that could tell him whether they were good or bad, he generally flung into the Fire, as soon as he had pleas'd himself enough in reading them.</p><p>WHATEVER Care he took to burn these little Pieces, he found it not sufficient to conceal them. The Thing took Air; and <span class="hi">Stephen,</span> who had before the Name of a Scholar among the Country People, was said now to be able to write Verses too. This was mention'd accidentally, about a Year ago, before a young Gentleman of <span class="hi">Oxford,</span> who sent for <span class="hi">Stephen</span>; and after some Talk with him, desir'd him to write him a Letter in Verse. That Letter is the Epistle which stands the last in his Poems, but was the first whole Copy of Verses that ever he wrote. This happen'd to fall into the Hands of some Clergymen in the Neighbourhood, who were very well pleas'd with it; and upon examining him, found the Man had a good deal of Merit. They gave him some Presents, which, as Things stood then, were a great Help to him; and encourag'd him to go on as much as they could.</p><p>THIS made him proceed with more Courage: And, as he had wrote some scatter'd Verses on <span class="hi">Poverty,</span> before this happen'd, he carry'd those Thoughts on, and fill'd it up, as it stands at present in the printed Collection I send you: So that this is his second Copy. I am very careful in settling the Chronology of his Poems, that you may see how he has gone on Step by Step, if you please.</p><p>THE Composition which was next in Order, is that on his own <span class="hi">Labours:</span> That Subject was given him by one of those who first encourag'd him; and after this was finish'd, he was employ'd from the same Quarter in his <span class="hi">Shunammite. </span>As this exceeded any of the rest, I think from hence we may date the Aera of his rising in his Character and Circumstances. Upon this it was that Per sons of Distinction began to send for him different ways. In short, it got him Fame enough to be pretty trouble some to him at first; tho' it is likely to end in a much happier Settlement of him and his Affairs, than could ever have been dreamt of by him at his first setting out.</p><p>WHEN you have read his Poems, and consider the Manner he has been bred up in, I doubt not you will think they have their Merit: But I assure you, they give an imperfect Idea of the Man; and, to know how much he de serves,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e14064">[Page xvi]</span> one should converse with him, and hear on what Reasons he omitted such a Part, and introduc'd another; why he shortens his Style in this Place, and enlarges in that; whence he has such a Word, and whence such an Idea. I'll give you all I can recollect of this kind, in relation to what is generally reckon'd the best Thing he has wrote, <span class="hi">The Shunammite. </span></p><p>IN the first Place, I found upon Inquiry, that he wrote by a Plan; he thought over all the Parts, as he intended to use them, before he made the Verses. For a Poem of any Length, no doubt 'tis as necessary to do this, as it is to have a Draught of a House, before you go to building it; and yet I believe, the common Run of our Poets have generally thought themselves above it, or not thought of it at all. Tho' the <span class="hi">Shunammite</span> was written on a Story given to his hand, still something of this kind was convenient enough; because, in forming it anew, he did not make use of all the Materials before him, and has brought in some of his own. He thought, the Stretching of the Prophet in so particular a manner, must sound strange. The Woman introduc'd to tell her Story, is a new Cast of his own; so is her Doubting, and then Confirming herself again, by a particular Induction of all <span class="hi">Elisha's</span> Miracles; so the Bringing an Audience about her, and their Chorus's, when they join together in congratulating her Happiness; the last of which closes the Poem in a good proper manner.</p><p>UPON being ask'd, Why he introduc'd a Person to tell all the Story in the <span class="hi">Shunammite,</span> and why he could not as well tell it himself; he said, he had read <span class="hi">Prior's</span> <span class="hi">Solomon</span>; and that, in reading it, <span class="hi">Solomon's</span> speaking every thing touch'd him particularly. He was then ask'd, since it was to be spoken, why he did not rather chuse the Prophet, as the Person of the greater Dig nity, to speak it. He said to this, That the Woman was to be pity'd; That there seem'd to him to be<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00035">Such as these:<span class="q">Ver. 16. And she said; Nay, my Lord, thou Man of God, do not tye unto thy Handmaid.</span><span class="q">Ver. 28. Did I desire a Son of my Lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?</span></span> some Expressions of the Woman in the History, which, if not omitted, might lessen our Regard and Compassion for her; That, if the Prophet had related the Thing, he could not have omitted a Word; but when the Woman did, she might well be allow'd to soften her own Case; and to drop, when she was cool, any thing wrong, that she had said in the Violence of her Grief and Passion. This is rather fuller in Words than he express'd it; but nothing, I think, is added to his Meaning.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e16297">[Page xvii]</span><p>AS <span class="hi">Milton</span> had been his favourite Poet, you may wonder why none of his Pieces are in blank Verse. I ask'd him about this too: Upon which he told me, That he had originally written the whole <span class="hi">Shunammite</span> in blank Verse; That, upon reading it over, he found his Language was not sublime enough for it; and that therefore he was forc'd to write it all over again, and turn it into Rhyme.</p><p>UPON reading over the Chapter and his Poem together, you will see how justly he shortens and enlarges some of the particular Passages, in order to adapt them the more to Poetry. Besides some Things already mention'd, he drops several little Circumstances in it<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00040">See 2 Kings, Chap. iv. Verses 10, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, and 35.</span>. On the other hand, he enlarges on the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00045">Line 33 to 49.</span> Contentedness and Charities of the Woman; on the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00050">55, <span class="hi">&amp;c. </span></span> Look and Attitude of the Prophet; on her<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00055">76.</span> Thanks for bearing a Son; on<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00060">112 to 134.</span> the Death of the Child; on the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00065">152, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> See 205.</span> Reasons of her Confidence in the Prophet; in<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00070">211.</span> pointing out the Prophet, when she comes to him; and in<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00075">219.</span> his Answer; in her<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00080">232.</span> pressing the Prophet more earnestly to assist her; in<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00085">246.</span> pointing out the dead Child; his being<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00090">258.</span> freed from Death; and her Thoughts<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00095">266.</span> upon receiving him again into her Arms.</p><p>'TIS agreeable to see what Use he has made of the little Reading he can have had, and how he has improv'd the Thing, by observing some good Strokes in the Books he has met with. Upon my telling him, that I lik'd nothing better in it, than his altering<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00100">From Line 55 to 63.</span> the Prophet's Countenance as he does; he said, he took that Hint from <span class="hi">Telemachus</span>; where the young Prince comes to <span class="hi">Idomeneus's</span> Court, while they are sacrificing. The Priest, on seeing <span class="hi">Telemachus,</span> breaks off from what he was about, assumes a more inspir'd Air, and begins speaking of his future Fortunes. This Alteration of the Prophet's Countenance, <span class="hi">Stephen</span> says, he took from thence; but that at the same time he thought himself oblig'd to drop the Wildness and Enthusiasm of it, in order to adapt it more to the Nature of a true Prophet.</p><p>THE Chorus in the Close of the <span class="hi">Shunammite,</span> he said, was brought into his Mind by the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="o4741-n00105"><span class="hi">Paradise Lost,</span> Book 7.

He seems to be exceedingly open and honest in every thing he says; and 'twould be very difficult for you to be with him a Week, as I have been, without going away very much his Friend.</p><p>THO' I have been so long in shewing you how critically he has proceeded as to his own Works; I shall add some of his Thoughts on the Works of others, to give you as full an Idea of him as I can.</p><p>'TIS not yet three Years ago that he first met with <span class="hi">Milton</span>; and I believe, that was the first Poet of real Value, that he ever study'd in earnest. He has assur'd me, with all his Innocence and Simplicity, that when he came after wards to read <span class="hi">Addison's</span> Criticisms on <span class="hi">Milton</span> in the <span class="hi">Spectators,</span> 'twas a high Pleasure to him to find many Things mention'd there, in the Praise of <span class="hi">Milton,</span> exactly as he had before thought in reading him. Here we must depend on his Credit, which I need not tell you with me is very good.</p><p>THE Name of <span class="hi">Milton,</span> whom he admires and dotes on so particularly, has not prevail'd on him enough to make him like his <span class="hi">Paradise Regain'd. </span>In speaking of these two Poems, he said,<span class="q"> "he wonder'd how <span class="hi">Milton</span> could write so incomparably well, where he had so little to lead him; and so very poorly, where he had more."</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e20135">[Page xix]</span><p>THE <span class="hi">Spectators,</span> you know, he has read with great Pleasure, and great Improvement. I remember particularly, that on somebody's calling them <span class="hi">Prose,</span> he said,<span class="q"> "'Twas true, they were <span class="hi">Prose</span>; but there was something in 'em, that pleas'd almost like <span class="hi">Verse.</span>"</span>— He mention'd, with more Regard than usual, the critical Papers on Wit, those on <span class="hi">Milton,</span> the <span class="hi">Justum &amp; tenacem</span> from <span class="hi">Horace,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Pope's</span> <span class="hi">Messiah,</span> and the several scatter'd ones written in the Cause of Virtue and Religion.</p><p>UPON asking him what Plays he had read, he nam'd particularly <span class="hi">Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Cato, Venice Preserv'd,</span> and <span class="hi">the Orphan. Venice Pre serv'd,</span> he said, gave him the most <span class="hi">Horror</span>; a Word which I took notice he us'd sometimes for Sorrow, and sometimes in its proper Sense: He could not bear the comic Parts in it. <span class="hi">Hamlet</span> he lik'd better than <span class="hi">Julius Caesar</span>; and in <span class="hi">Hamlet</span> pointed out that celebrated Speech, <span class="hi">To be, or not to be,</span> &amp;c. as having been his favourite Part, merely of his own Taste. He did not admire <span class="hi">Shakespear's</span> Comedy; and said,<span class="q"> "He was too high, and too low."</span>I read over to him some of <span class="hi">Hamlet,</span> and the celebrated Speeches of <span class="hi">Antony</span> to the People in <span class="hi">Julius Caesar. </span>He trembled, as I read the Ghost's Speech; and admir'd the Speeches and Turns in the Mob round <span class="hi">Caesar's</span> Body, more, he said, than ever he had done before. As I was reading to him, I observ'd that his Countenance chang'd often in the most moving Parts: His Eye was quick and busy all the time; and, to say the Truth, I never saw Applause, or the shifting of proper Passions, appear so strongly in any Face as in his.</p><p>HE had formerly read <span class="hi">Tom Brown's</span> <span class="hi">Letters from the Dead,</span> and the <span class="hi">London Spy,</span> not without some Pleasure; but, after he had been some time conversant with the <span class="hi">Spectators,</span> he said,<span class="q"> "He did not care much to look into them."</span>He spoke of <span class="hi">Hudibras</span> in another manner; he saw a great deal of Wit in it, and was particularly pleas'd with the Conjurer's Part in that Poem: But, after all, 'tis not a Manner of writing that he can so sin cerely delight in, as in the Moral, the Passionate, or the Sublime.</p><p>INDEED what every body seems to admire him for, is, that he seems to have an excellent moral Turn in his Thoughts. He is, as I told you before, something of a Philosopher; and, what is better than a Philosopher, a good honest-hearted Man. He has read, and speaks highly of, the Archbishop of <span class="hi">Cambray's</span> Demonstration of the Being of a God, and Mr. <span class="hi">Addison's</span> Defence of the Christian Religion. He said,<span class="q"> "That they touch'd his Mind; and that nothing did so well, as when one's Reason is mov'd by what is said."</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d24240e22313">[Page xx]</span>He had lik'd the little he had read of <span class="hi">Epictetus</span>; but 'twas <span class="hi">Seneca</span> that had made him happy in his own Mind. He seems as yet not to be hurt at all by any Applauses that have been given him, and to have been perfectly con tented with his Condition before: When he had only receiv'd some Pre sents from Gentlemen in the Country, he was quite easy as to his Circum stances. The only Thing then, that he was solicitous about, was, how he might succeed as to the Poetry he should be employ'd in. This was his chief Concern: But even this seem'd to proceed not so much from any Desire of Fame, as from a Principle of Gratitude; or, as he express'd it, his Longing to please those Friends that had been so generous to him. He was not lifted up with the Character some People gave him, and talk'd of Fame absolutely like a Philosopher. After his best Fortune, many of his Friends told him the Danger of being vain; and, if he should once be so, that he would be as much despis'd as he had been applauded. He said,<span class="q"> "That he could not well tell what they meant; That he did not know what it was to be vain: But, since so many great Men, who knew the World so much better than he did, were apprehensive for him on that head, he began to be terribly alarm'd at his Danger, tho' he had no settled Ideas of what it was."</span>He was told upon this, That he should never speak too highly in Praise of the Poems he had written. He said,<span class="q"> "If that was all, he was safe; that was a Thing he could never do, for he could not think highly of them: Gentlemen indeed, he said, might like 'em, because they were made by a poor Fellow in a Barn; but that he knew, as well as any body, that they were not really good in themselves."</span></p><p>THUS, Sir, I have obey'd your Commands as faithfully as I am able.
