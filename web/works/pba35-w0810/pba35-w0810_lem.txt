to mrs. Putland.

uncommon charm, i plain see,
 complete the fair for tyranny. 
then, lest your form shall make you vain
 of conquest, and of give pain,
 those, who your beauty have enslave,
 by i shall now be undeceived. 

long be i fool enough to view
 thy rapturous shape, and think it new;
 till late read Waller over,
 i find it be amoret before.
