To Mrs. Putland.

Uncommon Charms, I plainly see,
 Compleat the Fair for Tyranny. 
Then, lest your Form should make you vain
 Of Conquest, and of giving Pain,
 Those, whom your Beauties have enslav'd,
 By me shall now be undeceiv'd. 

Long was I Fool enough to view
 Thy rapt'rous Shape, and thought it new;
 Till lately reading Waller o'er,
 I found 'twas Amoret's before.
