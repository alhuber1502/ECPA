An ODE on Miss HARRIET HANBURY at Six Years old.

By Sir CHARLES HANBURY WILLIAMS.

I.

WHY shou'd I thus employ my time,
To paint those cheeks of rosy hue?
Why shou'd I search my brains for rhime,
To sing those eyes of glossy blue?

II.

The pow'r as yet is all in vain,
Thy num'rous charms, and various graces:
They only serve to banish pain,
And light up joy in parents' faces.

III.

But soon those eyes their strength shall feel;
Those charms their pow'rful sway shall find:
Youth shall in crowds before you kneel,
And own your empire o'er mankind.

IV.

Then when on Beauty's throne you sit,
And thousands court your wish'd-for arms;
My Muse shall stretch her utmost wit,
To sing the victories of your charms.

V.

Charms that in time shall ne'er be lost,
At least while verse like mine endures:
And future HANBURYS shall boast,
Of verse like mine, of charms like yours.

VI.

A little vain we both may be,
Since scarce another house can shew,
A poet, that can sing like me;
A beauty, that can charm like you.
