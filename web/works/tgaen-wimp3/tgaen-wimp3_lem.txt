imitate from Propertius, Lib: 3: eleg: 5:

love, gentle power, to peace be ever a friend:
before the goddess shrine we too, love votary, bend.
still may his bard in soft fight engage:
war hand to hand with Cynthia let i wage.

long as of youth the joyous hour remain,
i may castalia sweet recess detain,
fast by the umbrageous vale lull to repose,
where Aganippe warble as it flow;
or rouse by sprightly sound from out the trance,
i will in the ring knit hand and join the muses dance.
give i to send the laugh bowl around,
my soul in bacchus please fetter bind;
let on this head unfading flower reside,
there bloom the vernal rose early pride;
and when, our flame commission to destroy,
age step betwixt love and i, and intercept our joy;
when my change head these lock no more shall know,
and all its jetty honour turn to snow;
then let i right spell of nature way.
to providence, to he my thought i will raise,
who teach this vast machine its steadfast law,
that first, eternal, universal cause;
search to what region yonder star retire,
who monthly wane hide her paly fire,
and whence, anew revive, with silver light
relume her crescent orb to cheer the dreary night;
how rise wind the face of ocean sweep;
where lie the eternal fountain of the deep;
and whence the cloudy magazine maintain
their wintery war or pour the autumnal rain;
how flame perhaps, with dire confusion hurl,
shall sink this beauteous fabric of the world;
what colour paint the vivid arch of Jove;
what wondrous force the solid earth can move,
when pindus self approach ruin dread,
shake all his pine and bow his hundred head;
why do yond orb, so exquisite bright,
obscure his radiance in a short-lived night;
whence the seven sisters congregate fire,
and what bootes lazy wagon tire;
how the rude surge its sandy bound control;
who measure out the year and bid the season roll;
if realm beneath those fable torment know,
pang without respite, fire that ever glow;
earth monster-brood stretch on their iron bed;
the hiss terror round alecto head;
scarce to nine acre tityus bulk confine;
the triple dog that scare the shadowy kind;
all angry heaven inflict or hell can feel,
the pendent rock, ixion whirl wheel,
famine at feast and thirst amid the stream.
or be our fear the enthusiast empty dream,
and all the scene that hurt the grave repose,
but picture horror and poetic woe?

these soft, inglorious joy my hour engage;
be love my youth pursuit and science crown my age.
you, who young bosom feel a noble flame,
redeem what Crassus lose and vindicate his name.
