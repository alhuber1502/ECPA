It is not easy to de termine, whether this arises from a suspicion that their Talents are unequal to support the Character they have assumed, or whether it proceeds from an idea, that (as of Poetical Merit all the world <span class="hi">are,</span> or <span class="hi">pretend</span> to be, Judges) the utmost appearance of diffidence is ne cessary to defend the Candidates for the Laurel from the Vengeance of Criticism. The Man who publishes a Treatise in Theology, or an Essay on Farriery, comes<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e6069">[Page ii]</span> boldly forward, and delivers his opinion without ap parent apprehensions. But such is not the case with the Poet; he generally thinks himself obliged to state,<span class="q"> "that the following Poems were never intended for the Public Eye — that they were written for the entertainment of a select Circle, or (how felfish!) merely to amuse himself — that either the earnest intreaties of friends, or a dread lest their zeal might have tempted them to circulate incorrect copies of his works, are his sole motives for appealing to the Tribunal of Public Criticism."</span>— Such is the general Prelude to Poems. But the Author of this Volume is much at a loss how he may properly deprecate the Public Vengeance, for having aspired to the title of a Poet; as he confessedly comes forward, neither urged by the intreaties of Friends, nor terrified by the threats of Creditors; and he certainly entertains no apprehensions that his slen der stock of Fame may be injured by the publication of spurious Copies, for none such exist. — He has there fore<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e6863">[Page iii]</span> nothing to plead in his own excuse, but that the Publick having without disgust received his humble attempts in Prose, he is encouraged by the Protection he has already experienced, to appear once more as an Author, hoping, that those whom he may fail to please, will pardon his having attempted it.</p><p>To many the Perusal of these Trifles will restore the recollection of times long past. They will be re membered with pleasure, though mingled with that re gret which ever attends the recollection of happy days that are to return no more.</p><p>In extenuation of any Errors that may occur in these Poems, the Author has only to say, that they were mostly written from the age of Seventeen (when he commenced his Literary Career) to Twenty-four; that at that time of life the Imagination is more active than the Judgement; and that at present he is so reduced by a long and tedious illness, as to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e7563">[Page iv]</span> be incapable of improving whatever he has written. For the last four years of his life, those hours that have not been marked with disease have been devoted to studies of a severer nature, in order to qualify him for the practice of a profession, which a Constitution debilitated by disease obliges him now, for ever, to relinquish<span id="o5280-n00035_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Had it pleased the all-wise Disposer of all events to have spared Mr. B's life, he hoped to have obtained some appoint ment in the Diplomatic line, fo…" href="#o5280-n00035" aria-controls="o5280-n00035" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o5280-n00035"><sup>*</sup> Had it pleased the all-wise Disposer of all events to have spared Mr. B's life, he hoped to have obtained some appoint ment in the Diplomatic line, for which, as well as for the Bar, nature and education had excellently qualified him. Mr. B. never had, at any moment of his life, an idea of going into the Ministry — he saying to his friend about a month before his death,<span class="q"> "Nothing <span class="hi">this</span> world has to offer could ever in duce me to go into orders whilst it pleases GOD to spare me my understanding."</span>Mr. B. had from early youth been <span class="hi">in treated</span> to read with deep attention the thirty-third chapter of the Prophet Ezekiel, and St. Paul's Epistles to Timothy and Titus; and Mr. B. firmly believed, that<span class="q"> "ALL Scripture was given by inspiration."</span></span>.</p><p>From a mind exhausted by pain and sickness, ema nations of splendor cannot be expected. Had the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e8503">[Page v]</span> Author still possessed that share of health, which once constituted his first felicity, he might have rendered his performances less deserving of censure: but, what ever be the result of their publication, the writing of them has occupied many an hour that might have been worse employed; and he may add, that his having a Literary turn of mind has procured him the acquaintance and friendship of many, whose superio rity of Talents he readily acknowledges, and from whose Conversation he has derived at once Pleasure and Instruction. Neither has an Attachment to Poe try, as is too often the case, prevented his pursuing Studies of a different cast. From the Works of his Friend Doctor Reid (and those of other able Writers in the same line), he has derived a pleasure more so lid than Poetry can bestow. Poetry may charm with the power of Fancy; but it is Philosophy alone that can strengthen the mind.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e9204">[Page vi]</span><p>As the Author's present state of health renders it probable that this may be his last Address to the Publick, he will not lay down his pen without ad verting to the Reviews. Those Channels of Literary Intelligence are often censured, as both partial and severe. How far these charges may be just, he will not pretend to determine: but he wishes those who bring the charge to recollect, that Reviewers are men; that some degree of partiality is inseparable from humanity; and that therefore, till we are sup plied with Reviews from above, they, like every other human invention, must have their imperfections. However, in matters of Religion, the Reviewers may have improper biasses; in matters of Belles Lettres, their opinion will in general be found to be impartial, and by appeals from their decision little is now to be gained. We live in an age when Literary Merit is throughly understood; and the Volumes that are now condemned, will derive little advantage from the award of Posterity.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e9960">[Page vii]</span><p>Having said thus much on the subject of the Re views, he thinks it right to declare, that he has not the least personal acquaintance with any of the Gentle men who compile them. Of his connections with the Reviewers, in his literary capacity, he has no right to complain. Where he has merited censure, they have inflicted it fairly; and they have often cheered him with approbation.</p><p>Whatever be the result of their Decision with re spect to this Work, he promises to submit without any appeal. With respect to the Trifles that com pose this Volume, he has only farther to observe, that, instead of inscribing the whole to one person, he has inscribed the separate Poems to different people, as slight tokens of his esteem. For this mode of Dedi cation, though now he does not think himself bound to offer any apology, possibly his plan may recall to the memory of his Readers the fable of the Hare and many Friends; and should the Author fail of<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e10720">[Page viii]</span> success in his present attempt, he, like the Hare, may experience the inutility of Friendship. But, what ever be the success of his Volume, he will still have the satisfaction to reflect, that he has never written a line, which,<span class="q"> "dying, he might wish to blot."</span></p></section></div><li><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-6">SONNET ON THE DEATH OF GEORGE MONCK BERKELEY, ESQ.

MONCK BERKELEY;</span></h1></header><div class="byline">WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESENT TIME.</div><p>MY first knowledge of Mr. Berkeley was at Oxford. He was then a Gentleman Commoner of Magdalen Hall in that University; and though many very respectable names were at the same time on the list of its members, yet Mr. Berkeley was so pre-eminently noble in his manners, so faithful in his friendships, and so benevolent to his asso ciates, that perhaps not one of the society envied his high reputation as a man, or thought themseves lessened by the acknowledged superiority of his talents as a scholar. His delight was in searching out merit; and, well knowing that it fled from the glare of day, and should be sought after in the shade of retirement, he there looked for that humble, but valuable plant, and, having found it, transplanted it in stantly into the richest soil he had access to. The soul of the great Bishop Berkeley seemed in every thing to have<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e13370">[Page xiv]</span> animated the body of his Grandson, and, like him, to have equally deserved the just tribute of praise recorded by the sweet Poet of his day:<span class="q"> "To Berkeley every virtue under Heaven."</span></p><p>Genius marked him in his earliest years for a child of her own adoption; and had not Providence, for some good pur pose, hidden from our eyes, recalled his spirit from the abodes of men, when it was verging upon the years where youth ends and manhood begins, he would not have needed the impartial pen to have told the admiring world that he possessed every power,</p><div class="q"><div id="o5280-l00095" class="l"> "Whether, by various rules of art,</div><div id="o5280-l00100" class="l">" To touch the soul, or warm the heart;</div><div id="o5280-l00105" class="l"> "To please the eye, delight the mind,</div><div id="o5280-l00110" class="l">" With objects simple, pure, refin'd:</div><div id="o5280-l00115" class="l"> "To sound sublime the epic strain,</div><div id="o5280-l00120" class="l">" Like Falccus charm, or with the rage</div><div id="o5280-l00125" class="l"> "Of Juvenal, chastise the age;</div><div id="o5280-l00130" class="l">" Sweet as the prophet's vision to unfold</div><div id="o5280-l00135" class="l"> "What sainted breasts have felt, but never told:</div><div id="o5280-l00140" class="l">" What Bards to us with sparing hand have given,</div><div id="o5280-l00145" class="l"> "Of lib'ral gifts bestow'd on them by Heaven." </div><div class="biblfree">WEBB.</div></div><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e14207">[Page xv]</span><p>Through a long and oppressive illness, he supported with unabated vigour the soul of the Christian, the ties of friend ship, and the benevolence of the man.

Some years ago, when Mr. Berkeley visited France, and got a letter of introduction to his Grace, then Ambassador at Paris, containing a very ur gent request that Mr. Berkeley might have particular attention, his Father, laughing, said,<span class="q"> "You may plead your grandsire's <span class="hi">merits</span> in crossing the ocean to prevent his Grace's grandsire's being <span class="hi">butchered</span> by that <span class="hi">wretch</span> Lord Bruce."</span>All who have read that tragical tale related by Mr. Addison in "The Guardian," and in the second volume of Collin's Peerage, p. 196, must rejoice that poor Lord Bruce died possessed of a very different spirit from that which influenced him in life; that he, like the thief on the cross, was called into the vineyard at the eleventh hour and a half, or rather <span class="hi">three quarters,</span> just before the <span class="hi">final</span> close of the day of MERCY and GRACE; for his soul passed into the region of spirits within the hour.</span>).</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e20133">[Page xx]</span><p>Mr. Berkeley was born at Bray, in the county of Berks, on Tuesday, February 8, 1763, at half past two in the morning.</p><p>It is frequently said by Biographers, that nothing re markable occurred during childhood. Of Mr. Berkeley this cannot be asserted; for, throughout childhood, youth, man hood, and till within a <span class="hi">very</span> few months of his death, the hair-breadth escapes of losing life were almost innumera ble; an all-gracious Providence constantly interposing, some times very remarkably, to rescue him from death, until he was enabled, by free Sovereign Grace, through Redeeming Mercy, to meet that King of Terrors with joy; for he died triumphing in Christ.</p><p>A little before the birth of Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Cadogan's "Essay on the Nursing of Children" made its appearance, when the depositing children in cradles was exploded; ac cordingly a large easy chair during the day was appropriated to his use. When he was about six weeks old, a person going into the nursery in the dusk, before the servant had lighted candles, sat down on this chair; but providentially did not sit quite to the back, it being very deep. She soon<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e21008">[Page xxi]</span> felt something move; the infant, finding itself incommoded, began to struggle with its arms and legs. Mr. Berkeley, from his birth, shewed the very uncommon strength of limbs, which, as he grew up, increased; and he was esteemed the strongest man in England, by those who were judges. Some of his intimate friends have owed their lives, in a tumultuous crowd, to the strength of his arm, joined to his true resolute cool courage, where he did not wish to have recourse to his sword. Mr. Berkeley's strength was muscular, as his bones were remarkably small; his wrist, some time before his death, measuring little more than six inches.</p><p>When he was about three months old, his mother was attacked by so desperate an ague, that it was supposed ano ther fit must have proved fatal to her; yet so unwilling was she, that her darling, her idol (alas) from his cradle to his coffin, should be indebted for his early nourishment to any but herself, that she resolved to attempt the bringing him up by hand; but he had very nearly lost his life in the at tempt, before a nurse could be procured.</p><p>At a very early period of his life he began to shew signs of that uncommon brilliancy of parts, quickness of wit, and soundness of judgement, which so remarkably distinguished him through life, even to its latest period. To relate wit ticisms of a child to any but a fond parent would be ridicu lous;<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e22139">[Page xxii]</span> one or two instances, it is hoped, may, however, be pardoned. When about three years old, he was searching the house for his mother, whom from his earliest infan cy, he passionately loved. Unable to find her, he walked from room to room, calling her. A lady, who was staying in the family, said,<span class="q"> "My dear child, what a bleating thou dost make!"</span>He instantly turned round, and said,<span class="q"> "To be sure I do, for I am <span class="hi">bleating for my Dam.</span>"</span>When he was little more than three years and a half old, he was di verting himself in the garden. A beggar came to the gate, and, seeing the hall doors and windows all open, and no one in sight, said,<span class="q"> "My pretty little Master, what are you doing here alone?"</span>He replied,<span class="q"> "I am watering some flowers for the gardener."</span>The old fox said,<span class="q"> "I think I must come in and help you;"</span>on which Mr. Berkeley flew to the gate, and bolted it, saying,<span class="q"> "No, I thank you, I can do it very well by myself."</span>On his maid's asking him why he bolted the gate, he replied,<span class="q"> "Why, if he had got into the house now that the men are out with the coach, perhaps the maids and I could not have got him out again."</span></p><p>Generosity and compassion are indeed very rarely found until instilled into the breasts of very young children: in Mr. Berkeley they were certainly indigenous. When a child in arms, if he was asked to give a piece of cake out of his hand, he would instantly break off three-fourths of it,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e23398">[Page xxiii]</span> reserving only a very small piece for himself, and be un happy if the petitioner did not take and eat it. On re ceiving his orange after dinner, when it was peeled, he would retire to the window ahd carefully separate the quills, then go out into the servants 'hall, and force one upon every servant, eight in number. One evening his mother observing that he kept his left hand closed, enquired whe ther he had hurt it; the servant replied, that he had not, but that he had kept since dinner, full four hours, a quill of his orange to give to the coachman, who had been sent to Windsor on a message, and that no promises of care could prevail on Master Berkeley to entrust her with it, adding, that he assured her,<span class="q"> "it would <span class="hi">comfort</span> him after his ride."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley had been told, as all children should be, that the poor had a right to a share of all his money; ac cordingly, the first bright sixpence of which he was master, he procured a hammer, and attempted to break it. On his servant's asking him what he was about, he replied,<span class="q"> "Why Mamma says, the poor must have their share of it, so I am going to break it for them."</span>This attended him to his latest hour; for the distressed ever shared largely indeed in every guinea he possessed.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley's understanding was such as often, when a child, to occasion his Mother to say, she hoped he would<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e24555">[Page xxiv]</span> not, in other instances, resemble the famous Marquis de Bedmar, of whom, in his Memoires, it is said, he had the power of appearing to be entirely taken up with bagatelles, when he was listening to every thing that was saying by va rious persons, and when he was plotting the destruction of Venice.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley, when only five years old, would stand at the window seat, and hum a tune, and three weeks after wards would relate two different conversations carried on at the same time, and not only relate them verbatim, but take off exactly the action and tone of voice of every speaker. Of this dangerous, however diverting amusement, Mr. Berkeley was early broke by his Mother.</p><p>The first eight years and a half of his life Mr. Berkeley had no other instructor than his Mother; and such was the extreme volatility of his genius, the wonderful <span class="hi">strength</span> of his understanding, and the <span class="hi">natural</span> wilfulness of his temper, that the difficulty of teaching him to read was an Herculean labour, so much as often to occasion him to say, when grown up, that<span class="q"> "he was <span class="hi">resolved</span> not to learn to read; that he did verily believe his Mother was the only <span class="hi">human</span> being who could have accomplished it until he was old enough to feel the necessity of it<span id="o5280-n00060_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="A brother of the late Sir Thomas Stapleton, of Gray's Court, persisted in a like resolution, saying it was nonsense to learn, until he, at thirteen, w…" href="#o5280-n00060" aria-controls="o5280-n00060" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span style="display:block" class="collapse note  div" id="o5280-n00060"><sup>*</sup> A brother of the late Sir Thomas Stapleton, of Gray's Court, persisted in a like resolution, saying it was nonsense to learn, until he, at thirteen, was sent to sea on board a ship commanded by Sir John Norris, who, on learning the young gentleman's sentiments, assured him, that he should be flogged every day until he could read.

His beloved and re spected tutor at Eton, the Reverend Dr. Norbury, too well known in the learned world to need any eulogium from a feeble pen, used to say, that there were wonderful traits of originality in all Mr. Berkeley's exercises. On this being mentioned one day by a friend to his Father, Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e26950">[Page xxvi]</span> Berkeley, then a young man, said,<span class="q"> "Ah! my <span class="hi">dear Tutor</span> (as, to the time of his death, he ever termed Dr. Nor bury) I do pity him. He used to storm, and say, 'I have thirty <span class="hi">dolts,</span> that <span class="hi">cannot</span> do any thing; and I have three or four, with that idle varlet Berkeley at their head, that <span class="hi">can do every thing,</span> and that <span class="hi">will</span> do nothing."</span>And when Dr. Berkeley used to complain of his son's idleness to Dr. Norbury, his reply was,<span class="q"> "Sir, if your son would apply at <span class="hi">all,</span> he must carry the world before him; but I must tell you fairly, such is his genius, that I do not believe that <span class="hi">man lives,</span> who can make him apply regularly, until he comes <span class="hi">himself</span> to see the necessity of it."</span></p><p>The very learned Dr. Hill, professor of Greek at the uni versity of St. Andrew's, (now Dean of the Chapel Royal at Edinburgh,) where Mr. Berkeley <span class="hi">did</span> apply, used to say, that he would engage to select Mr. Berkeley's exercise from amongst a thousand, without any other mark than what the French term<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">le marque</span> d'ouvrier."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley, although he could not be called a <span class="hi">man</span> of business, might with propriety be termed a <span class="hi">crea ture</span> of business, from seven years old; for he always felt himself, as he thought, equal to transact any thing that he offered his services to perform. The following little inci dent may serve to illustrate this: before he was seven years old, his Mother, being alarmed lest one of his front teeth should grow uneven from the old one not being removed,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e28202">[Page xxvii]</span> had sent him to town to Hemmet, who very honestly said,<span class="q"> "All would be right if let alone;"</span>and he proved that his judgement was as great as his honesty; for, when Mr. Berkeley grew up, and sometimes went to him for his tooth powder, he often said, that Mr. Berkeley had the finest and strongest set of teeth he ever saw in any head. He returned home with a gentleman who was coming on a visit to his Father's. A lady of very large fortune happened to be in the machine, going on a visit to a friend at Taplow. Finding that he lived in the neighbourhood, she asked him how far it was from Maidenhead Bridge to Taplow? He replied, that it was about ten minutes drive. She said, she must walk, as her friends, not knowing the day of her arrival, could not send their carriage. He replied, that she certainly should not do that; for that his Father's coach would be sent to convey the gentleman and himself; and that he would certainly have the pleasure of taking her up the hill to her friend's house. The instant he got out of the ma chine he enquired of Mr. March if his Father's coach was come, and had the mortification to hear, that the coach man had called to say, that the carriage was gone on to carry some gentlemen over Maidenhead Thicket, and would call for him in an hour. Mr. Berkeley, not then seven years old, said,<span class="q"> "Madam, it is very <span class="hi">improper that a lady</span> should walk on the high road <span class="hi">alone;</span> so <span class="hi">I</span> will have the honour of walking up with you. I can borrow a <span class="hi">stick</span> of Mr. March."</span>This <span class="hi">protection</span> was, as will naturally be<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e29525">[Page xxviii]</span> supposed, politely declined; and the lady ordered a chaise. As soon as she alighted, her first question was,<span class="q"> "Do you know Dr. Berkeley of Cookham?"</span><span class="q"> "Yes, intimately."</span><span class="q"> "Do you know his little boy? If you do not, you do not know, I very believe, the most sensible little crea ture in the world, and the politest;"</span>adding,<span class="q"> "there was a tall young man (of, I suppose, near thirty) with him; but the dear child has twenty times his sense, and forty times his politeness."</span>The gentleman was a learned man, who laughed at that pleasing accomplishment, politeness: he was <span class="hi">then</span> what <span class="hi">fine</span> men are <span class="hi">now. </span>Mr. Berkeley was almost idolized by the family to whom the lady was going; so it appeared not so wonderful to them.</p><p>In the May after he had completed his eighth year, Dr. Berkeley went to reside at his prebendal house in the Oaks at Canterbury, where he was immediately sent to the King's school, under the care of those two eminent masters, the learned, accomplished, elegant Dr. Beauvoir, and the reverend, learned, and worthy Mr. Tucker. In Au gust, a gentleman's family going to France to place a son at St. Quintin, to learn the language; his Mother sug gested to his Father the advantage of sending Mr. Berkeley, who, although she had taught him to read French well, yet found it impossible, with an house full of English servants, to make him speak it; and as it never was the considera tion of a moment with his parents, whether any thing con cerning<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e30735">[Page xxix]</span> their children's education was to cost one guinea or one hundred, immediately determined to send him. Young as he was, he was the only one of the party who knew any thing of French; and the sensible amiable lady, whose son was going to learn the French language, at her return, de clared, that they should have been half starved at the inns and hotels, had not Mr. Berkeley been with them, saying,<span class="q"> "That lovely little creature seemed quite inspired; for he began in French telling the waiters it was a shame to let English ladies and gentlemen sit there without their tea and chocolate."</span>He used to run to the bar, and drive them in before him with whatever was wanted. In his own language, it may with strictest truth be asserted, that even at that early period of life he was a great profi cient; for there is not a word in the English language which, at the age of seven years, he could not spell without book; and of most of the difficult words, he perfectly understood their sense, and used them with the strictest propriety; which occasioned the sensible Sir J.

The unfeigned affection he ever retained for the French friends of his early youth appeared when, at the age of seventeen, he published his<span class="q"> "Maria, or the Generous Rustic,"</span>by his selecting the names of his actors in that beautiful little volume from the families with whom he lived, and those by whom he was caressed<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e33635">[Page xxxi]</span> and delighted, indeed almost idolized, for he had ever most engaging attracting manners.

On being thanked by a gentleman, who had re quested him to take up his pen, for his elegant translation of "Nina," inscribed to the Honourable Mr. Hobart, he replied,<span class="q"> "Sir, the favour was very trifling, for (excepting the sonnet) it employed me only just six hours."</span></p><p>When a child at the King's School at Canterbury, his mother used to rise at six o'clock in summer, to walk with him out of the city for country air.

Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e34847">[Page xxxii]</span> Berkeley, then little more than eight years old, unobserved, stayed behind talking to her. When he joined his Mother, she began reproving him, by saying,<span class="q"> "It is very wrong to talk to such persons without one means to relieve them, and that she was persuaded his yesterday's allowance was all gone:"</span>to which he replied, in his sweetly melodious voice,<span class="q"> "Why, the poor woman said she had not ate a <span class="hi">morsel to-day</span> (the church clock struck <span class="hi">seven</span> as he was speaking); and I told her, I had no money; but asked her, if some gingerbread nuts that I bought last night would be any comfort to her and her <span class="hi">poor little child;</span> and she said yes; so I stayed that I might get them <span class="hi">all</span> out of my pocket for her."</span></p><p>His mother's eyes filled with tears of gratitude to God for having blessed her child with <span class="hi">such</span> an heart; and she has fre quently declared that had she been offered fifty thousand pounds not to have heard that early ebullition of that (through life) lovely heart, she would have rejected it. The same sweet spirit attended him amidst all his torturing illness. Not many days before his death, a poor family in distress being named, he turned on the sofa on which he was lying, and, not finding in his pocket what he thought sufficient to send them, eagerly desired his servant might be called, to take his keys to get him some more money, to send to them; and, when his mother assured him that they had been already relieved by his father and aunt, he replied,<span class="q"> "that a <span class="hi">little</span> more would comfort them!"</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e36101">[Page xxxiii]</span><p>When Mr. Berkeley was between ten and eleven years old, a melancholy affair happened at Canterbury. One of those unfortunate orphans who are said to be <span class="hi">happy</span> in having CAREFUL guardians, had, in the summer vacation, stepped over from London to Paris, had there spent more than his scanty allowance, had repeatedly applied to his <span class="hi">careful</span> guardians (one, I think, his maternal uncle) for a little of his <span class="hi">own</span> money. His humble suit was rejected. He, however, reached Dover without a guinea; he again applied, but in vain. Utterly unable to reach London, this unfortunate youth, not yet nineteen, sallied forth on the high road between Dover and Canterbury. He unfor tunately met with an <span class="hi">amiable</span> farmer and his <span class="hi">compassionate cara-sposa</span> in what is called an hurdy-gurdy. From the former he took a silver-pewter watch with a greasy leather chain, and a fox's head set in brass; from the other, about seventeen shillings. This worthy pair drove with all speed to raise an hue and cry after their <span class="hi">foot</span> highwayman. The poor youth returned to the alehouse whence he sallied out, borrowed a petticoat of the maid servant, got a cork, blacked his face, and escaped into a wood, where he was taken, and in this wretched disguise brought to Canterbury. The news of so extraordinary a figure was soon spread; the children belonging to the King's School went beyond their bounds to see him. Mr. Berkeley soon returned, and told his Mother the lamentable tale. She, of course, moralized on the subject. Soon a violent noise was heard; Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e37285">[Page xxxiv]</span> Berkeley started to the window; then, sitting down, ex claimed,<span class="q"> "Good God! how can our boys be such brutes!"</span>and looked as pale as death. His Mother, who is short sighted, asked him what it was? He replied,<span class="q"> "The justices are sitting, and this poor creature is going to be exa mined, and our boys are hallooing after him, as if he were a mad dog."</span>It being one of those days on which the school hours permit the gentlemen's sons who board at home to dine with their families, Mrs. Berke ley observed, that her son did not eat at all, but leaned back in his chair.

A very ludicrous little anecdote might be repeated, of Mr. Wrightson's bargain ing with a bargeman, to buy Mr. Berkeley, then six years old, which entirely cured Mr. Berkeley of a <span class="hi">most dangerous</span> trick, of which had Mr. Wrightson told his Mother, the little man would have received a heavy chastisement indeed.</span> to carry that <span class="hi">poor</span> young man a few bottles of wine to the gaol? for my heart bleeds for him, and <span class="hi">I</span> have not money enough to buy him wine.

As children this was remarkable. The exquisite beauty of his brother attracted the eyes of all beholders, drew persons to their doors and windows to look at him, which, so entirely void of envy was Mr. Berkeley through life, that he used to come home in extacies, telling his mother how every body<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e40038">[Page xxxvi]</span> admired his <span class="hi">brother's</span> beauty. When he was about six years old, a lady meeting him one day, who admired him much, asked him if his little brother was like him. He instantly re plied,<span class="q"> "O dear, Madam, not at all; he is a vast deal hand somer than I am: every body wonders at his beauty that meets him in the street."</span>When one was about eight, the other rather more than four years old, the celebrated George Lord Lyttelton, staying some time on a visit at Dr. Berkeley's, said to a gentleman,<span class="q"> "that he did really think, that, mind and person, they were the very finest children he had ever seen during the course of his life."</span></p><p>The death of Mr. Berkeley's younger brother, caused by a dreadful fever which raged at that time in Canterbury, occasioned his being removed to Eton school some months sooner than was intended by his Father; but his Mother, trembling for her darling, the moment the physician pro nounced his brother's fever infectious, begged he might be sent away immediately, which he was within the hour, under the care of a faithful tender servant, who lived at his Father's family at the time of his birth, and until within about four years of Mr. Berkeley's death, when he married. For this worthy man Mr. Berkeley ever retained the most grateful regard and affection, as did his Parents, for his con stant unwearied attention paid by him to the health, the manners, the morals, of their ever-to-be-lamented son. To this worthy person's care was he constantly confided, from<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e41237">[Page xxxvii]</span> the time that he began to run alone, until after he quitted Eton school, and had a servant of his own. Mr. Berkeley used frequently to say,<span class="q"> "It is not easy to express the grati tude I feel towards John, for his wonderfully judicious method of managing such a refractory chap as I was, especially when I was from home, and he had not my Mother to call in to his aid."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley, with perhaps as amiable, as lovely a nature as ever God bestowed on any fallen child of Adam, had a very high spirit, and a very uncommonly wilful temper. Mr. Wrightson, by civility, gentleness, and ridicule, as a child and youth could prevail on Mr. Berkeley to give up any project to do any thing. Mr. Berkeley had a very affectionate regard for him; and, when visiting at his Fa ther's from Oxford or the Temple, if it were but from Saturday to Monday, he used constantly to say,<span class="q"> "I must go and sit half an hour with my old friend John in his pantry, and talk over old times, or he will think me unkind;"</span>adding,<span class="q"> "I am sure I owe it to him, for the <span class="hi">judicious</span> care he took of me in childhood and youth."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley's behaviour to servants, as servants, was, from early youth, very remarkably kind; and he never had any servant who would not have risqued almost every thing to serve and oblige him, excepting one Italian, whom he took for a few weeks, after an old servant of his married. This<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e42425">[Page xxxviii]</span> execrable villain threatened to murder him, for having or dered him to go a journey on the top of a stage-coach, Mr. Berkeley having a friend in the post-chaise with him. Such are foreign servants more frequently than is imagined by the <span class="hi">wise</span> persons who confide in them in preference to their own countrymen, who are seldom tempted to rob or murder a master, having no foreign tongue to secure them a <span class="hi">safe</span> retreat on the Continent.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley's tutor at Eton was, as mentioned above, the learned and respectable Dr. Norbury, under whose tui tion he had been placed by his Father, at the <span class="hi">earnest</span> re quest of his Mother, who knew his merits as a tutor, having resided at Windsor four years before her marriage, and conceived him particularly calculated to direct <span class="hi">such</span> a spirit as her darling son. The event proved that she was not mistaken; for, volatile and idle as Mr. Berkeley was, it is certain Dr. Norbury contrived to make him apply more than ever any one before had done, excepting his Mother, who often regretted, that, finding what cast of genius her eldest son had, she had not set about learning Latin and Greek, that she might have <span class="hi">made</span> him apply more closely in his youth. As a proof of Mrs. Berkeley's inflexible steadiness, in teaching her son and correcting his perverse ness of temper, she once made him say the word "Nico demus" <span class="hi">thirty</span> times, when he was about five years old, which he either could not, or would not, pronounce pro perly. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e43595">[Page xxxix]</span>When grown up, he used to say,<span class="q"> "Oh! my dear Mother, it was <span class="hi">would not;</span> for it was one of my numerous trials of skill with you;"</span>adding,<span class="q"> "but you were <span class="hi">very wise</span> to do it, or God knows what must have become of me!"</span></p><p>Dr. Berkeley's grand object was to see his son as great a scholar as his father Bishop Berkeley. Never having been at any school himself, but coming immediately from the palace of Cloyne to Christ Church in Oxford, he had conceived that Eton collegers, if they had talents, must necessarily be excellent scholars; and, after his son had been a considerable time at Eton, boarding at the house of the worthy Mrs. Tyrrell, and her truly amiable niece Mrs. Brookland, whom Mr. Berkeley, through his life, termed<span class="q"> "that angelic-tempered woman,"</span>he dutifully submitted to go into the long chamber, to the extreme affliction of his Mother, who conjured his Father, with many tears, not to remove him; but he consulted, and followed the advice of, the then provost of Eton, Dr. Barnard, although he had, by his accomplished, worthy friend, the late Dr. Sumner, of Harrow, been cautioned against his wiles, in these remarkable words:<span class="q"> "Never trust that man: he has a <span class="hi">black</span> heart: I had myself been head master of Eton, my friends in power having secured it for me; but, on my asking if Dr. Barnard was to be provost, and being an swered in the affirmative, I, for that <span class="hi">sole</span> reason, begged<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e44751">[Page xl]</span> to decline it."</span>The subsequent conduct of Dr. Barnard fully justified the truth of the character Dr. Sumner had given of him.

The late General Brudenell, deputy governor of Windsor Castle, being with his regiment in Germany, one day, as his lady was sitting at dinner, her son from Eton came in. She naturally enquired what could bring him up at that hour on a whole school day. The youth (aged between thirteen and fourteen) replied,<span class="q"> "Why, I am expelled."</span>Mrs. Brudenell (the knife and fork dropping from her hand) exclaimed,<span class="q"> "Good God! child, what have you done? Have you killed a boy?"</span><span class="q"> "No, I have done nothing but called my dame's upper maid a thief."</span><span class="q"> "That is impossible, child: you must have done something worse than that, or I am sure Dr. Barnard would not have expelled you."</span>The boy related the whole transaction, which appeared to her so utterly incredible, that she instantly sent a servant to request a gentleman of large fortune, her near neighbour, to call on her immediately; when the youth related to him the following facts, as they proved to be:<span class="q"> "That, having lost his Dictionary, he borrowed one, for two or three days, of some boys; but, finding that inconvenient, he and two of his friends went to the second-hand bookseller's in Eton, to try to buy one. A Dictionary was immediately produced, when one of his friends said, 'It is exactly like your own.' The other said, 'I verily believe it is your own.' Young Brudenell asked of whom he bought it. The man without hesitation said, 'Of dame<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>'s upper maid. She told me, a boy, who had left school, had given it to her. ' On a close inspection, there appeared a paper pasted over the inside of the cover. This being removed, Master Brudenell's name, and the date of the year when it was bought at Mr. Pote's, appeared. They carried it off; and, as soon as they arrived there, shewed it to the rest of the boys of the house, who unanimously agreed to interrogate the woman, how it came into her possession. She coloured, and replied, that she picked it up in their gate way. They asked her, if she could not read writing. She said,' No. ' This they knew to be false; but one of the larger boys said,' You must naturally have supposed that it belonged to some of us, and you are a thief; so they agreed to call her thief for a week. This so exasperated her, that she com plained to her Mistress, who instantly shewed Brudenell up to Dr. Barnard, the boy refused to be flogged until Dr. Barnard had heard his case; and if he did not find it true, he would suffer any thing he pleased to inflict. This he utterly refused, and instantly expelled him. "</span>The gentleman immediately went down to Eton, and, on examination, every tittle of Brudenell's account appeared to be literally true; but Dr. Barnard positively refused to re-admit him — Dr. Barnard shewed of what <span class="hi">materials</span> his heart was composed, by his<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>conduct to several amiable worthy young ladies in the neighbourhood.</span>, so well go verned, with such marked contempt as he did, by not suf fering<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e47520">[Page xli]</span> his son to be educated at that school, but keeping him at home in his own house, and introducing some per son to teach him there, never permitting him to associate or play with the fine youths of the school.

It is impossible to dismiss this article without attempting to celebrate the wonderful condescending amia bility of the <span class="hi">noblesse</span> of Scotland particularly, and in com mon with the ancient gentry of that kingdom, to strangers of any degree of fashion, and decent character. It was a common remark of Dr. Berkeley,<span class="q"> "Were a Scotch gentle man to settle for some time in any <span class="hi">southern</span> or <span class="hi">eastern</span> county of England, I wonder how many peers, or men who in <span class="hi">fortune</span> equal peers, would visit him?"</span>And al most every peer and man of fortune in Fife have done us that honour; which must ever be remembered with the most heart-felt gratitude by the Writer of this Preface. <span class="q"> "Oh! shame to our <span class="hi">English pride!</span>"</span>used to exclaim Dr. Berkeley. Although born in London, he spent the first eighteen years of his life under the roof of his noble illus trious-minded Father in the <span class="hi">next</span> hospitable country in Eu rope to Scotland: for the Scotch do certainly exceed even the Irish. As Mrs. Wedderburn used to say to the Wri ter of these pages,<span class="q"> "The Irish give you an excellent dinner and supper, and let you go out to <span class="hi">seek</span> a bed; <span class="hi">we</span> always find one."</span>The remark was just, and worthy the great<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e55010">[Page xlviii]</span> good sense of that throughly hospitable polite lady, who, having heard that Dr. Berkeley's family, none of whom she had ever then seen, were travelling near her house, im mediately ordered her beds to be prepared, and most po litely visited them at their inn, telling them that every thing was ready for their reception. This, and numberless other almost similar attentions from numerous other fa milies of rank and fashion has, for the last fifteen years, caused the writer of this to term Scotland the Land of polite <span class="hi">kind</span> Hospitality.

One of the amiable sons of Lord Leven, coming from abroad, went to an inn at Can terbury before he went to Dr. Berkeley's. He reproached him, on Mr. Leslie's saying,<span class="q"> "He feared being trouble some."</span>Dr. Berkeley replied,<span class="q"> "My dear Sir, if a <span class="hi">dog</span> came hither with a collar on his neck from Melvil house, I should feel myself a monster not to entertain him."</span></p><p>Mr. Monck Berkeley used often to be accused of par tiality to Scotland, and to his Scottish friends. Indeed he had one of the most amiable hearts that ever beat in a hu man<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e56157">[Page xlix]</span> breast. It must have been a <span class="hi">very cold</span> heart that had not felt such amiable, such respectful, attentions as Mr. Berkeley received in his seven hundred miles tour through the unfrequented parts of the Highlands; which was chiefly performed on foot, although Mr. Berkeley had three horses and two servants, but he often went where they could not follow him; and at Edinburgh, where he generally passed the first part of the St. Andrew's vacation, until the grouse shooting season commenced. Although greatly his su periors in learning, Mr. Berkeley had the honour to rank amongst his literary friends, Lord Buchan, the pro foundly learned, highly polished, all-accomplished Lord Monboddo, Mr. M'Kenzie, and Dr. Reid. It is hoped that the introducing here a <span class="hi">bon mot</span> of Mr. Berkeley's may be pardoned. Lord Monboddo, when visiting Dr. Berkeley at St. Andrew's, with his usual exquisite po liteness, pressed the Doctor and his family to visit him at Monboddo, and invited Mr. Berkeley to pass the next vaca tion there. Mrs. Berkeley said to her son,<span class="q"> "Surely you will go: it will be a wonderful advantage to you, to pass so many weeks under the roof of <span class="hi">such</span> a man as Lord Monboddo<span id="o5280-n00110_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Mrs. George Berkeley, from its first publication, was an enthusiastic ad mirer of Lord Monboddo's &#34;Ancient Metaphysics,&#34; so as to occasion Mr. Monck B…" href="#o5280-n00110" aria-controls="o5280-n00110" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span style="display:block" class="collapse note  div" id="o5280-n00110"><sup>*</sup> Mrs. George Berkeley, from its first publication, was an enthusiastic ad mirer of Lord Monboddo's "Ancient Metaphysics," so as to occasion Mr. Monck Berkeley's always styling it his Mother's <span class="hi">second</span> Bible. The first volume then only published, Lord Monboddo did Mrs. Berkeley the honour to send her the second, saying, he found she understood it, with a note by the hand of the very deeply learned, worthy Professor Hunter, a very sincerely highly respected friend of Mr. Monck Berkeley. One of the most striking likenesses ever produced by the pencil is a portrait of this wonderful genius, now in the possession of Mrs. George Berkeley, in his robes of a throughly upright just Judge. It instantly, on en tering the room, catches the eye of every stranger who has any skill in painting, and very often of those who are honest enough to declare they have not any skill.</span>.

She saw, she could not <span class="hi">but see,</span> herself the idol of all the young men; yet not one air of superiority, not a grain of affectation, ever appeared in her conduct. A va riety of diverting little anecdotes of the universal desire of the young gentlemen students of St. Andrew's to appear agreeable, at least not disagreeable, to Miss Burnett, might be related by the writer, to the amusement of the reader.</p><p>D<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>M<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, Esquire, one of those few Laymen, as Dr. Berkeley used to observe, who kept up their classical learning after they had quitted the university, (for he ge nerally redde Greek from four to six hours every day,) was a great admirer of the rising genius of Mr. Berkeley, inso much that he became sincerely attached to him; and Mr. Berkeley ever retained a most affectionate grateful regard for this gentleman's condescension, as he termed it, in suf fering a youth from school to enjoy so much of his society, who had children elder than Mr. Berkeley.</p><p>As the families lived in the greatest intimacy, in the happiest friendship, they generally met three or four times a week.

Dr. Berkeley being at that time in an indifferent state of health, the journey was about six weeks in performing, as he rested some time at York; where Mr. Berkeley had, what he ever esteemed an honour, young as he was, of commencing an acquaintance with the truly learned and pious Dr. Burgh, by the polite atten tions of his Mother's respected friends, Mrs. Moritts<span id="o5280-n00115_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Every person of any fashion, who visits York, endeavours to obtain an introduction to those sensible cultivated ladies; the many only to gratify their…" href="#o5280-n00115" aria-controls="o5280-n00115" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o5280-n00115"><sup>*</sup> Every person of any fashion, who visits York, endeavours to obtain an introduction to those sensible cultivated ladies; the many only to gratify their eyes with a sight of the exquisitely fine <span class="hi">paintings in needle-work</span> of the eldest Mrs. Morritt; those who are capable of relishing refined conversation, to feast their minds: the house of those excellent ladies being the general rendezvous of every one who can relish the charms of refined conversation.

By the very polite atten tions of the Dean of York, his Lady, and several other families of fashion, which were ever most gratefully re membered, Mr. Berkeley and the family passed their time most agreeably in that antient city, to which the library of the very civil Mr. Todd contributed in no small degree, one of the delights of Mr. Berkeley's life being to read in<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e62376">[Page liv]</span> a library; a happiness he enjoyed in his Father's house, Bishop Berkeley's library being valued at two thousand pounds at the time of his death.

A very little way out of the town stands Lauder Castle, one of the seats of the late worthy Earl of Lauderdale. As the horses were to bait at least two hours, Mr. Berkeley, after dinner, went down to the castle; the family being ab sent, he requested the porter to permit him to enter, and look at the pictures. He had from his childhood a wonderfully fine eye for painting. It is probable he owed it to the so often hearing the merits and demerits of his grandfather's col lection of pictures talked over.

Several families were invited to meet him, and a very gay afternoon was spent; Mr. Berkeley telling Mrs. <span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>, that she had made a better match for herself than the Gewd Weef at Lauder Castle wished to have made for her. Mr. Berkeley, who had neither vanity nor conceit, here exceeded the truth. Dr. L<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, a friend of his father, and the worthy Sir C. B<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, a very old friend of his Mother, both urged him seriously to visit them, to see after two young ladies of immense fortunes in their respective counties, assuring him that he must infallibly succeed. Mr. Berkeley's uniform reply to all such kind invitations was,<span class="q"> "I early resolved, not to be a fortune-hunter. <span class="hi">I</span> have no large rent-roll to pro duce. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e69184">[Page lx]</span>I will never alarm or distress the <span class="hi">anxious</span> Parents of any great Fortunes."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley, from his youth, from his Mother, was an <span class="hi">he reditary</span> admirer and strenuous advocate for the unfortunate INJURED Mary, and a detester of her cunning, cruel per secutor Elizabeth, requested his Father to go to St. Andrew's by the road of Kinross, that he might visit the castle of Loch-Leven; and he spent some time in wandering about the ruins; so much as occasioned his and his servant's being benighted on a heath, to the extreme distress of his Mo ther, who was then unacquainted with the exquisite, the amiable hospitality of the Scottish nation, high and low, rich and poor; for Mr. Berkeley could with difficulty force a shilling into the hand of a man who went a quarter of a mile over the heath to put him in the road to Cupar-in-Fife, where his family were to sleep that night, and it was very late before he and his servant arrived there.</p><p>The next morning they all set out for St. Andrew's, about eight miles distant; and enjoyed, the prospect from the top of the hill, of the <span class="hi">still</span> magnificent cathedral, and the tower of St. Regulus or St. Rule, of which there are four beau tiful engravings with Cardinal Bethune's Castle by Oliphant, now exceedingly scarce, and very dear, the plates being lost<span id="o5280-n00135_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="It is supposed, that when that ingenious young man died, the plates were sold, amongst other metal things, for their weight." href="#o5280-n00135" aria-controls="o5280-n00135" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o5280-n00135"><sup>*</sup> It is supposed, that when that ingenious young man died, the plates were sold, amongst other metal things, for their weight.</span>.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e70312">[Page lxi]</span><p>On entering the city at the Argyle Port, your eye is greeted with a noble wide street, one mile in length, and at the lower end of a noble breadth, with stone houses, most of them disfigured by what is termed a <span class="hi">fore stair,</span> that is, an open stair case, on the outside, in a zigzag manner across the front of the house, and an huge <span class="hi">smidie,</span> a not inelegant name for a filthy thing, a dunghill; no court, no palisade, no breast-wall or railing, before even the best houses, excepting only what was once the palace of James the First of England; but it is not meant here to give an imperfect description of this once beautiful magnificent city, which has been so well done by Boswell and Pennant, be fore John Knox <span class="hi">preached</span> it into ruins, by removing an archbishop, dean, and eight resident prebendaries, who fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and administered to the wants of the sick and needy, who are all now starving. On a full sight of this dreary deserted city, Mr. Berkeley wept to think that he was to remain, if God spared his life, three long years in it. The house taken for Dr. Berkeley's fa mily, the best then to be had in the town, was without even a back door, the covetous wretch who owned it having sold a little spot behind it to a gentleman at the next house; so the door was stopped up. Dr. Berkeley, seeing Mr. Berkeley so deeply affected, and Principal Watson, whose learning had induced him to prefer St. Andrew's to a fo reign university, having died a very few days before, made Mr. Berkeley the offer of returning to England the next<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e71618">[Page lxii]</span> day; for which he felt great gratitude, but, with his wonted strength of mind, declared, that, let him suffer what he might, he would remain his three years. It is but justice to say, that Mr. Berkeley shed more tears at leaving St. Andrew's, than he drew sighs at entering it.</p><p>So deeply was submission to <span class="hi">lawful</span> authority engraven on Mr. Berkeley's mind, that during the three years and a half he was a student at the university of St. Andrew, he never would go out for even two or three nights to his no ble, truly amiable friend the Earl of Leven's, at Melvil House, without going to <span class="hi">ask leave out,</span> as it is termed, of the Principal Dr. M'Cormick, whom Mr. Berkeley always called,<span class="q"> "our polite, amiable Principal;"</span>or, in his absence, of the Professor, who used politely to say, that,<span class="q"> "he living in his Father's house, it was needless to trouble himself."</span>His constant reply was, that<span class="q"> "the statutes, which he had promised to observe, <span class="hi">enjoined</span> it."</span></p><p>It is hoped that the relation of a little adventure which Mr. Berkeley met with during his residence at St. Andrew's may be pardoned. A very few days before the term began in autumn, Mr. Berkeley, who was at that time a very keen sportsman, was told by the son of the Professor of Medicine, a very sensible young man, now settled in Ca nada, that, if he wished it, he could lead him to a place where Ptermagants abounded. The youths set out,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e72786">[Page lxiii]</span> marched several miles; night overtook them, and they wandered in a very dark evening, unable to find the road. At length the moon began to appear, and presented to their view a figure all in white. Mr. Berkeley soon learnt to speak Scotch so perfectly, as at any time throughout his life, to be mistaken, whenever he wished it, for a true Scot; which often amused his friends, or strangers, of that country, which his Mother ever termed<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">The Land of kind Hospitality;</span>"</span>a proof whereof will soon appear.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley accosted the young woman with,<span class="q"> "Lassey, whither gang ye?</span></p><p>Lassey. —<span class="q"> "To yonder house, Laddie.</span></p><p>Mr. B. —<span class="q"> "Can we get lodging there to night?</span></p><p>Lassey. —<span class="q"> "Hoo can ye ask that question with these wea pons in your hands?

They then escorted the nymph about a quarter of a mile to the house; where Mr. Berkeley refused to enter until permission was obtained by their kind guide, who went in alone. In a minute out rushed<span class="q"> "a bevey of fair nymphs,"</span>more than<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e73822">[Page lxiv]</span> twenty, with a matron in the rear, who very wisely began examining them, how they came on that wild heath at that hour; who, and what they were. Mr. Berkeley, being spokesman, assured them that they were honest young men, students of St. Andrew's. Still they were distrusted.</p><p>At length, fortunately for them, a young woman espied a youth in the highland dress, and, going up to him, asked<span class="q"> "Who he was?"</span></p><p>Servant. —<span class="q"> "Who? why I am servant to that tall gen tleman.</span></p><p>Young Woman. —<span class="q"> "And who is he?</span></p><p>Servant. —<span class="q"> "Who? why Mr. Berkeley, secondary at St. Andrew's.</span></p><p>Young Woman. —<span class="q"> "Where does he come from, to keep a servant at college?</span></p><p>Servant. —<span class="q"> "Why, from England."</span></p><p>Young Woman. —<span class="q"> "From what part of England?</span></p><p>Servant. —<span class="q"> "Why, from Canterbury. My Master's Fa ther is one of the Prebendaries there, and is a gentleman of <span class="hi">great</span> family."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley used to laugh when relating this conversa tion, and say,<span class="q"> "All M'Nicoll's account of my Father's <span class="hi">dig nity</span> in the <span class="hi">church</span> availed <span class="hi">me no more</span> than they will do in<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e74695">[Page lxv]</span> the world of spirits."</span>But luckily some one asked Mr. Berkeley's highlander,<span class="q"> "Who was his master's companion?"</span>to which he, being irritated, replied,<span class="q"> "What does that signify? He is son to Dr. Flint of St. Andrew's."</span>The magical name of Flint, as Mr. Berkeley used to say,<span class="q"> "acted like a charm."</span>Dr. Flint is a most incomparable physi cian. Mr. Flint was immediately examined and <span class="hi">cross exa mined;</span> and it was determined to admit them, they deli vering up their guns to the nymphs. Mr. Berkeley, with his usual elegant gallantry, instantly delivered his into the hands of their kind guide. They then went into the house, being almost starved with cold, and sadly tired. Plenty of food, and a good fire, soon re-animated them. Still they saw nothing but females, all clothed in white. No male appeared. The men were attending the corn. At length, they all agreed, that it was time to set off — me lancholy news, as Mr. Berkeley used to say, to a couple of young men. Whither were they to go? <span class="q"> "Could not the beaux escort them,"</span>they replied,<span class="q"> "to a neighbouring har vest-home, to a dance?"</span>Mr. Berkeley, who was a remarka bly fine dancer, and loved it exceedingly, jumped up, for got all the fatigues of the day, and said,<span class="q"> "that he and his friend would attend them."</span>Their hospitable and very sen sible hostess replied,<span class="q"> "Oh, Sir! it is not such a ball as you have been used to in England; there will be only far mers 'daughters. I will have the pleasure of endeavouring to entertain you and Mr. Flint here."</span>Mr. Berkeley,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e75979">[Page lxvi]</span> with his usual engaging politeness, said,<span class="q"> "There will be <span class="hi">your</span> daughters, Madam, and our kind conductress to your hospitable roof."</span>The young men went and danced in the barn till four in the morning; slept soundly, as may be guessed, until near noon; took an excellent <span class="hi">Scotch</span> break fast, (even Dr. Johnson liked the <span class="hi">breakfasts</span> in Scotland;) and, after inviting his kind hostess and her son to dine at his Father's house in St. Andrew's, when either business or pleasure called them to that ancient city, took their leave. The young man went once or twice to Dr. Berke ley's. Mr. Berkeley, who was born with what is com monly, but often falsely, called a princely spirit, although not to a princely fortune, did not think a few grateful speeches an adequate return for being rescued from sleeping among the heather on the heath; but sent his worthy landlady some fine prints, elegantly framed and glazed, to adorn her parlour, with which he had great pleasure in finding she was much delighted. Some of Mr. Berkeley's intimates among the students laughed at him, saying,<span class="q"> "Now, Berke ley, <span class="hi">you</span> have lain out a night without leave."</span></p><p>The great Charles Leslie, the famous controversial writer, used to say of Mr. Berkeley's maternal great-grandfather, the celebrated Francis Cherry, Esquire, of Shottesbrooke House, in Berkshire, that he believed him to have the most accurate, the soundest judgement, that God had, in these latter days, bestowed on man. A multitude of instances<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e77120">[Page lxvii]</span> might be adduced to prove, that although Mr. Berkeley in herited but little of Mr. Cherry's immense fortune, he cer tainly did of a better portion than money.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley, on his return from his highland tour, told his family, that he might, he believed, have lived seven years there, on the merits of the ring sent by the old Che valier de St. George to Mr. Cherry, when he sent Mr. Les lie, at his own expence, to Rome, to try to convert him from Popery. Mr. Leslie wrote Mr. Cherry word from Rome, that an attempt to make the sun rise in the WEST would be equally successful.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "He felt a <span class="hi">little</span> ashamed, that the ring should be <span class="hi">so</span> well known in the Highlands, and that <span class="hi">he, the presumptive heir to it,</span> had never seen it more than once or twice in his life."</span>He requested his Mother and Aunt to gratify him with a sight of it, that he might be able in future to give a <span class="hi">better</span> account of the famous relic.</p><p>It has been already observed<span id="o5280-n00140_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="See before, p. xix." href="#o5280-n00140" aria-controls="o5280-n00140" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o5280-n00140"><sup>*</sup> See before, p. xix.</span>, that one of Mr. Berkeley's friends used to tell him,<span class="q"> "that he was as extraordinarily de scended by his Mother's side<span id="o5280-n00145_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="William Cherry, Esquire, known by the name of the Great Lawyer, son of Sir Francis Cherry, esteemed the acutest counsellor of his time, as the learned…" href="#o5280-n00145" aria-controls="o5280-n00145" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>†</sup></a></span><span style="display:block" class="collapse note  div" id="o5280-n00145"><sup>†</sup> William Cherry, Esquire, known by the name of the Great Lawyer, son of Sir Francis Cherry, esteemed the acutest counsellor of his time, as the learned Earl of Clarendon bears testimony in his Papers and Letters published by Pow ney about thirty years ago. In one of the letters he says,<span class="q"> "I have had the opi nion of the attorney and solicitor general on my cause; but I <span class="hi">cannot rest</span> satis fied till I hear what old Cherry says about it."</span>Mr. Cherry was at law with King James when he fled. A considerable part of Shottesbrooke estate lies in Windsor Forest. Mr. Cherry had planted some young trees, and was inclosing them. The King rode by, and asked the labourer,<span class="q"> "Who bid him do it."</span>He answered,<span class="q"> "My Master, please your Majesty."</span><span class="q"> "It does <span class="hi">not</span> please me,"</span>replied the King;<span class="q"> "and <span class="hi">I</span> order you to throw up the inclosure directly."</span>He did so. Mr. Cherry's old steward informed his Master immediately of it; who ordered that the same labourer should directly set about inclosing it again. The next hunting-morning his Majesty found him at work, and asked,<span class="q"> "How he dared to do what he had forbidden him to do?"</span>He replied,<span class="q"> "His Mas ter had ordered it."</span>The King commanded him to undo his work at his peril; which the poor fellow did; and Mr. Cherry, who when in the country acted as a justice of the peace, committed him to Reading gaol, and com menced a suit against the King. Luckily for this poor man, he could not only read, but write; being clerk of the parish of White Waltham, where, and in many surrounding parishes, Mr. Cherry had large farms, and always found and made his tenants find work for the industrious labourers. When the poor inno cent culprit reached the gaol, he wrote a long and interesting letter to the King, telling his Majesty, that as his good old Master had now turned him off from his work for obeying him, he hoped his Majesty would be pleased, in his <span class="hi">conside ration,</span> to send him some money to keep him <span class="hi">comfortably</span> in gaol; and, after much more curious matter, subscribed himself<span class="q"> "his Majesty's poor, pitiful, patient, lamentable servant, JOHN HONE."</span>This letter reached the King about three weeks before he left the kingdom, when Mr. Cherry immediately liberated honest John, and took care that he had every comfort during his im prisonment; Mr. Cherry having sent the man to gaol only to teach the Mo narch what he might <span class="hi">not</span> do. Mr. Berkeley had for some years been writing a treatise on "The Prerogatives of the Crown;" and one volume was ready for the press at the time of his death. How far he would have approved his ancestor's conduct in this matter is uncertain. This transaction is somewhat differently told in the old ballad of "The King and Mr. Cherry." This gentleman was killed by the overturning of his chariot as he was going down a hill in Kent, near the seat of the grandfather of the late worthy Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, by whom, and his lady, every humane, amiable attention was paid him that his desperate situation would admit of. His death was the more to be lamented by his excellent son, as, on the coroner's inquest, it appeared to have happened through roguery, the verdict being,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">Killed by the footboard having been mended with old rusty nails.</span>"</span>On going down the hill, the coachman of course pressing more on the footboard than on even ground, it gave way, and he fell down among the horses; who immediately ran away in half a dozen different direc tions, threw off the postillion, and broke the chariot entirely to pieces. When they stopped, it was a quarter of an hour before Mr. Cherry's valet de chambre, who was attending his Master on horseback, could discover life either in his Master, Mr. Partridge, of the Isle of Ely, to whom Mr. cherry was guardian, or any of the servants. The moment he found his Master was not dead, he rode off to town, to carry down the Queen's serjeant-surgeon, and sent off from London an express to Mr. Cherry at Shottesbrooke. On the arrival of the surgeon, he asked Mr. Cherry,<span class="q"> "Where he felt pain?"</span>He replied,<span class="q"> "Ah! Sir! where do I <span class="hi">not</span> feel pain?"</span>A piece of the plate glass of the chariot was taken out of his head as large as the palm of a man's hand. Mr. Cherry lived only four days after the accident, the surgeon saying,<span class="q"> "He is the noblest ruin I ever saw. I never beheld such a man of eighty-three: but for this ac cident, he would probably have attained to the age of old Parr."</span>Mr. Cherry's strength of body and mind were equal at eighty-three to what they were at thirty-three. This account of Mr. Cherry's death, and Mr. Partridge's almost miraculous escape, is very differently and very erroneously related in a work printed about seventy years ago, by a gentleman of fortune in Devonshire. Mr. Cherry's lady's father, John Whitefield, Esquire, of Ives Place, near Maidenhead, was thrown from his horse, and drowned in the Thames, when taking an airing one evening near his own house, at an advanced age. Mr. Berkeley's Mother's paternal grandfather was killed by a fall from his horse, as he was riding one morning near his own house, at the age of eighty-one. The lady of the celebrated Francis Cherry, Esquire, the patron of Thomas Hearne, one of his under-footmen, was the eldest of the five co-heiresses of John Finch, Esquire, of Fienes Court, Berks. In the cloaths of this gentle man was King Charles the Second dressed, when he escaped with Lady Jane Lane. Oh! shame to <span class="hi">royal</span> gratitude, that this lady was not made a Duchess, to descend to her heirs female as well as male. He used to say,<span class="q"> "that he had worn Mr. Finch's old cloaths;"</span>Mr. Finch, having gone down a few weeks before, to marry the beautiful rich heiress of Sir John Chapman, aged fifteen. An exquisitely fine very small miniature of this Lady, by Pettitote, is in the pos session of Mr. Monck Berkeley's Aunt, Mrs. Frinsham; it having been pre sented to her, by Mr. Berkeley's Mother, at Mrs. Berkeley's marriage.</span>, as he was <span class="hi">nobly</span> by his Fa ther's, most of his maternal grandsires having had something<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e82946">[Page lxviii]</span> remarkable about them.

Mr. Price instantly replied,<span class="q"> "He was entirely at Mr. Berkeley's service; but hoped the matter might be accommodated without fighting."</span>Mr. Berkeley assured him,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">that was impossible.</span>"</span>They therefore proceeded to the place, where this wise young gentleman again urged the matter so sensibly, so eloquently, that Mr. G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>offered to make any submission that Mr. Berkeley should require. Mr. Berkeley from his infancy, although a little fury, was surely the most ready to pardon of all the fallen children of Adam; insomuch that his Mo ther used to say,<span class="q"> "That if any one murdered him, and he lived only three minutes, he would <span class="hi">freely</span> forgive them;"</span>constantly adding,<span class="q"> "Alas! he does not inherit that from <span class="hi">me.</span>"</span>Mr. Berkeley, however, was so exasperated at the brutal rascality of,<span class="q"> "I may say whatever I please, for you DARE not fight,"</span>&amp;c. that for once he appeared inexora ble. The ground was measured, the pistols were delivered, and the swords laid ready, when Mr. Price, instead of giving the word to fire, stepped in between the combatants, and so wisely, so pathetically conjured Mr. Berkeley to ac cept Mr. G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>'s offers of making <span class="hi">every</span> submission, that, at length, Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted sweetness, threw away his pistol, and said,<span class="q"> "Well, G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, you shall beg my pardon in no other way than saying, in Mr. Price's presence, before the gentlemen in whose company you insulted me, that you are sorry you provoked me. "</span>So this frightful affair ended. But not the gratitude of Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e88928">[Page lxxv]</span> Berkeley and his parents. Providence had placed Mr. Price in a situation to render other return than polite and friendly attentions out of the question. When Mr. Price went to France, they felt unfeigned pleasure in giving him letters of introduction to several very worthy French fami lies with whom they were intimate, which rendered his <span class="hi">séjour</span> in that once delightful country very pleasant.

(the bishops then wore purple coats:) "let us put them up."</span>Bishop Benson, being a much lighter man than Bishop Berkeley, instantly ran off to the opposite side of the way.

When introduced to the late Lord Mansfield by his Lord ship's desire, he eyed him about half a minute; when Mr. Berkeley expected him to say, what many lords and learned men had often said to him,<span class="q"> "that they were happy to see the grandson of their excellent old Friend,"</span>Lord Mansfield said,<span class="q"> "To Berkeley every virtue under heaven."</span>Mr. Berkeley instantly replied,<span class="q"> "How sweet an Ovid was in Murray lost."</span>Lord Mansfield said,<span class="q"> "You are, Sir, a very polite young gentleman, indeed. Aye, Sir, Mr. Pope was very partial to me;"</span>took Berkeley under the arm, and walked off with him. All Tunbridge talked of Mr. Berkeley's ready wit. Some of Mr. Berkeley's friends, on hearing it, said to him,<span class="q"> "Berkeley, we are afraid the old Prelate was a Forestaller, and has left none of these VIRTUES to you."</span></span></span> — as Solomon fell; — but, <span class="hi">with them,</span> he received grace<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e91595">[Page lxxvi]</span> to repent, and mercy to console his throughly humbled, penitent, contrite spirit. Mr. Berkeley had not sufficiently attended to that admonition of the Wise King,<span class="q"> "Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer."</span>Mr. Berkeley's enthusiastic love of music drew him into the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e91808">[Page lxxvii]</span> snares of the celebrated Mrs. <span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>.

From both it pleased the great MERCY of God to rescue him. For more than four years before his death, his lovely spirit was supplicating for that pardon promised by our all-gracious Redeemer to ALL who turn to him in faith —<span class="q"> "Him that cometh unto ME I will in no wise cast out."</span>Mr. Berkeley, reflecting on his thoroughly pious education and many other advan tages, considered himself as a much greater sinner than any of his young friends, who had not been so favoured by Providence, could possibly be. But it pleased the God of Mercy to speak peace to his wounded spirit;<span class="q"> "I have heard thy prayer; I have seen thy tears,"</span>Isaiah xxxviii. 5; and, for some weeks before his death, to pour the balm of perfect peace into his dear wounded spirit, and most gra ciously to<span class="q"> "lift up the light of his reconciled countenance upon him."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley had too strong an understanding not to be lieve with his <span class="hi">whole</span> heart and mind the truths, the <span class="hi">blessed</span> truths, revealed in the Gospel of Peace. He was blessed with an <span class="hi">honest</span> mind, as has been said of a very great man still living, as much Mr. Berkeley's superior in years as in rank. <span class="q"> "His Lordship is <span class="hi">too</span> honest to endeavour to warp the Gospel to <span class="hi">his</span> life, and he <span class="hi">feels</span> every day that they are at war; which makes him so ill-tempered, with a won derfully amiable nature; ever <span class="hi">acting</span> the kindest things,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e93051">[Page lxxviii]</span> ever <span class="hi">speaking</span> the roughest."</span>There Mr. Berkeley resem bled <span class="hi">not</span> the noble Peer; for he was never known from a child to say a disobliging thing to any one.

On his being pressed to appear against him, he <span class="hi">absolutely</span> refused. When strongly urged that it was <span class="hi">right,</span> he replied,<span class="q"> "It <span class="hi">must</span> be so, to be sure, to hang a poor devil, who might have murdered me; for we were in the cham bers alone, and he only took my watch and a few gui neas. No, I hope he may live to repent. Poor crea ture!

His Lordship, with the usual<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e94280">[Page lxxix]</span> spirit of <span class="hi">nineteen,</span> was resolved not to be robbed. Dumas demanded his watch and money. Out sprang his Lordship: down jumped Dumas: Lord P<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, as he then was, at tempted to fire; his pistol would not go off. He threw it down, and had recourse to the second, which likewise flashed in the pan. Dumas then said,<span class="q"> "Sir, you are in my power: you will be pleased to give me your watch and money."</span>The request was complied with. In a short time Dumas was taken, committed to Fisherton gaol, and tried. Lord P<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>was subpoenaed to appear. His Lordship's purse was produced. He said,<span class="q"> "He could not say that was his purse."</span>Then the watch: his Lordship could not say the watch was his. The seals, arms, crest, &amp;c. were produced; but his Lordship said,<span class="q"> "It was im possible for him to <span class="hi">swear</span> to them."</span>On being asked by his friends, when he came out of court,<span class="q"> "if he had <span class="hi">lost his wits,</span> not to know his own arms, crest,"</span>&amp;c. he nobly re plied,<span class="q"> "Know them? to be sure I do. But do you think I would take away the life of a poor distressed creature, who had <span class="hi">my</span> life in his power, and would not hurt a hair of my head?"</span>It was immediately said that Lord P<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>was become a Methodist — an high compliment surely to the Methodists. It is not likely that a follower of that arch hypocrite, John Wesley, should have acted thus, unless some pelf or plunder was to be obtained thereby; at least if they resembled their wretched leader, whose practice was<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e95544">[Page lxxx]</span> to fleece the rich, to feather, <span class="hi">finely</span> feather, harlots and rogues. Witness poor Mr. and Mrs. G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>ths, of C<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, who, were induced to turn their house into a kind of Lock Hospital, until they had no house left in which to shelter their aged heads, only a two pair of stairs lodging in Lon don. On their first acquaintance with the ZEALOUS apostle of<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>they kept a carriage, and a pair of good horses to draw it, a coachman, footman, and several female ser vants. A few years reduced them to the situation above described. A letter written by Mrs. G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>ths, from the London garret, to a lady at C<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, describing their suf ferings, was sufficient to have distressed any hearer of it. But it was of a piece with his setting Miss B<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>t, with fifty thousand pounds, to wash her own linen, that young harlots might be healed of their bodily diseases, and dressed out to draw in poor deluded young men to marry them. One of the nymphs thus restored to health at Mrs. G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>ths's was actually married to a person in London, who settled on her a jointure of three hundred pounds <span class="hi">per annum. </span>Such were the good works of John Wesley! May his followers cease to practise them! One does not find them recommended in Scripture. St. Paul says,<span class="q"> "Charge them that are rich, that they be ready to distri bute, willing to communicate,"</span>&amp;c.; not turn themselves into washer-women, and retire to garrets, with their poor, blind, lame, deluded husbands, as did Mrs. G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e96758">[Page lxxxi]</span><p>But to return. To say that Mr. Berkeley's servants loved him, is too feeble an expression. His own, and the servants of his Father's family, in general old in his service, almost idolized him. His generosity, his condescending goodness to the meanest servant in the house, was so en gaging, that joy enlivened every countenance whenever he visited at his Father's. He had been very early taught, that, although it had pleased Providence to place him in a different station of life from his Father's servants, yet that he must ever treat them with kind civility. He and his brother were always made, whilst children, to take off their hat to the lowest peasant and washer-woman who passed them in the village: and so habitual was it to Mr. Berkeley to be<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">courteous to all men,</span>"</span>that when he gave orders to his servant, a stranger to him would not have supposed he had been speaking to his own domestic; yet, wonderful to relate, he had one servant, who actually had a desire to lie in wait to murder him: but he was an Italian<span id="o5280-n00165_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="See above, p. xxxvii." href="#o5280-n00165" aria-controls="o5280-n00165" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o5280-n00165"><sup>*</sup> See above, p. xxxvii.</span>. This may be a warning to English and Irish gentlemen to be less fond of foreign servants. Mr. Berkeley, wanting a servant at a time when few were in London; a person who owed Mr. Berkeley much gratitude earnestly recommended this villain. Mr. Berkeley objected, wishing either an English or Scotchman; always thinking it wrong to employ fo reigners to the detriment of our own countrymen, he how ever yielded. Dr. Berkeley, at his return from visiting his son in town, said to Mrs. Berkeley,<span class="q"> "I think your son<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e98008">[Page lxxxii]</span> seems to have got a Devil in the form of a fine tall fel low."</span><span class="q"> "What does he do?"</span><span class="q"> "Nothing, I believe. But such a pair of diabolical eyes I never saw before in my life."</span>Mrs. Berkeley, ever anxious for her idol, wrote to her son, who, with his usual benignity, replied,<span class="q"> "The poor fellow, to be sure, is not handsome; nor has he a very benign countenance; which made my Father think him diabolical: but he does every thing that I want, although he is not like Ritchie, or M'Nicol."</span></p><p>When Mr. Berkeley was once ordered to the sea, a day or or two before he set out, accompanied by his excellent unwearied friend H. Grimston, Esquire, he told this ser vant, that,<span class="q"> "as he wished to lounge and change his pos ture frequently, and as he could not accommodate three in the chaise, it being summer time, he should go down on the top of the coach."</span>This <span class="hi">Signor</span> re sented, as <span class="hi">such</span> an indignity, that, on his arrival, he utterly refused to act at all; so that, but for Mr. Grim ston's servant, Mr. Berkeley must have been exceed ingly distressed. His ill humour increasing daily, Mr. Berkeley at length discharged him without the least anger or reproach. The sweetness of his nature never suffered his anger to rise against an inferior. My superiors, he used ever to say, shall <span class="hi">feel</span> it if <span class="hi">they</span> treat me improperly. This wretch, instead of returning to London the next morning, stayed the whole of the next day, and when he did set off, said,<span class="q"> "He had waited all that day to murder his master,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e99289">[Page lxxxiii]</span> but he found it was in vain, for that he kept close."</span>It providentially happened, that Mr. Berkeley's horse had picked up a nail, and he could not ride into the country, as was his constant custom, to drink milk from the cow, morning and evening; neither did he go to the library or rooms that day; which Mr. Berkeley, when mentioning it, looked upon as the mercy of an all-gracious, over-ruling, particular Providence, in which he ever believed, ever trusted, and was never disappointed. Mr. Berkeley, not having any Italian blood in his veins, could form no idea of this villain's spirit of revenge. He was immediately re placed by a very worthy honest Englishman, Mr. William Morfey, for whose attentive, incessant care Mr. Berkeley felt himself so much indebted, that some little time before his lamented death, he requested of his Father and Mother,<span class="q"> "that he might remain in their family as long as service should be agreeable to him,"</span>although he had a compe tency without it.</p><p>It is almost impossible to avoid relating here a little circumstance, that will shew the contrast between the En glishman and the Italian. For some time before Mr. Berke ley's dissolution, finding himself unable to fit up through the day, he rose not until after the family had dined, that he might enjoy the society of his friends in the afternoon. He constantly dismissed his servant to eat his dinner in com fort, ordering him not to hurry himself, and not to return until he rang his bell. One day his bell rang, and Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e100484">[Page lxxxiv]</span> Berkeley's Mother, conceiving that the servant had not dined, went to the top of the kitchen stairs, and told the servant, she would go up and see what his Master wanted, and if she could not get it, ring for him. He replied,<span class="q"> "No, Madam, I must go myself."</span>The housekeeper and the other servants urged him to stay, saying,<span class="q"> "You have but <span class="hi">one single</span> mouthful to finish; do pray eat it; Mr. Berkeley is never impatient, he will wait."</span>He replied,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">No; I will not stay to eat it.</span>"</span>His Mother once recom mending to his care a most affectionate, tender-hearted servant, her old housekeeper, who came into the family when Mr. Berkeley was a lad, to keep in his family, if it pleased God to spare him to settle; he lifted up his fine eyes, and replied, in the tenderest tone of voice,<span class="q"> "My dearest Mother, there is no occasion for <span class="hi">you</span> to recom mend Mrs. Marsh to <span class="hi">me.</span>"</span>When Mr. Berkeley's ex quisitely fine picture, presented to his Mother by his beloved friend Mr. Peters, arrived at Dr. Berkeley's, this amiable-hearted woman hastened to assist at the unpacking it, and, on seeing it, sunk motionless upon it. Heartfelt grati tude forces the Writer of this Preface to celebrate the incessant unwearied attention of the two above named servants, as also of the very worthy Mrs. Jane Godwin, who has for many years been the happy domestic of Mr. Berkeley's in comparably kind, generous, excellent Aunt, Mrs. Frin sham, for the delightful alacrity, and unwearied assiduity, with which they endeavoured incessantly to alleviate Mr. Berkeley's intolerable, <span class="hi">all but insupportable,</span> bodily sufferings,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e101750">[Page lxxxv]</span> as indeed did every other servant in the family: for all which sufferings Mr. Berkeley repeatedly returned hearty thanks to God, frequently saying to his Mother,<span class="q"> "I would not have been without them for all this world has to give, as, I am persuaded, nothing short of what I have suffered could have brought <span class="hi">me,</span> as I <span class="hi">ought,</span> to come to Christ"</span>Such universal benevolence may tempt the pos sessor to feel less need of the atonement.</p><p>It is impossible to omit here my most grateful acknow ledgements to many amiable-hearted persons in the inferior stations in life, to whom Mr. Berkeley was only known by his almost divine philanthropy, and by his severe sufferings — at Hastings, at Dover, and at Cheltenham — who seemed to vie with each other, who should be most active in <span class="hi">endeavour ing</span> to lighten the distress of a poor miserable stomach, that for many months regurgitated every delicacy of every kind<span id="o5280-n00170_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Mr. Berkeley frequently, for days together, did not retain any thing taken into his stomach for one minute; which occasioned one of the most emi nent …" href="#o5280-n00170" aria-controls="o5280-n00170" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o5280-n00170"><sup>*</sup> Mr. Berkeley frequently, for days together, did not retain any thing taken into his stomach for one minute; which occasioned one of the most emi nent Physicians to pronounce positively, that the passage into the stomach was stopped, and must be opened by a method known to medical gentlemen. This was not the case; as sometimes, for two or three days successively, plainly ap peared. Mr. Berkeley was one of the most temperate of men, never, from the age of fifteen, tasting a morsel of any food between his meals; no sand wich; no soup; nor any thing else, even if he did not dine until six o'clock; and very rarely ate any supper when he dined at the old-fashioned hour of three at his Father's house.</span>.

As the autumn advanced, the want of a warm sea-bath obliged him to quit Hastings, and he repaired to Dover, accompanied by his excellent relation above named, Mrs. Frinsham; where he received such amiable, such incessant attentions, from the lovely family of Laurie, the angelic Mrs. Firebrace, and the very worthy Mrs. and Miss Payne — although it were<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e104298">[Page lxxxvii]</span> impossible, even if possessed of the mines of Peru and Mexico, to repay their kindness, yet must it ever be, whilst possessed of life, registered in the retentive grateful memory of the Editor; and may HE who rewardeth <span class="hi">every one ac cording to, although not for,</span> their good works, reward these amiable friends an hundred, a thousand fold, in TIME, and through the countless ages of ETERNITY, is a prayer offered <span class="hi">daily</span> at the throne of that God who <span class="hi">hears</span> and <span class="hi">answers</span> prayer, as is often happily experienced by those who <span class="hi">believe</span> and <span class="hi">trust</span> HIS gracious promises, revealed in the Holy Scriptures. The mention of these particular kind, old, intimate friends of Mr. Berkeley and his family, does not prevent the Writer from feeling the sincerest gratitude to numberless other of the wonderfully amiable inhabitants of Dover, who, high and low, seemed to study who should be most forward in shewing every <span class="hi">possible</span> attention to Mr. Berkeley, so much as frequently at this time to occasion the above named worthy domestics to say,<span class="q"> "they never saw such de lightful people as the inhabitants of Dover."</span>It has been repeatedly asserted many years ago by the Writer, who has often bathed in the sea at Dover, that the inhabitants, even the very lowest ranks, were certainly the most cour teous people in Europe, and attributed it to their vicinity to their once amiable, delightfully courteous neighbours on the other side of the water. The streets of Dover are narrow, of course the pavement cannot be wide; and so <span class="hi">very</span> attentive are they, that you never see an inferior<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e105502">[Page lxxxviii]</span> take the wall of a superior, or a charity-school child of an elder person.

Dr. Berkeley being from home for a few nights, Mrs. Berkeley instantly dispatched a letter to Mr. Sharp, conjuring him to permit her Son to wait on him, she being convinced that he was in a very dangerous situation. The permission was, in the politest manner, more than granted.

During his stay at the house of his excellent rela tion, Dr. Dering, Prebendary of Canterbury, he very obligingly wrote a pre scription for a snuff for Mrs. George Berkeley's eyes. To that gentleman's great skill, when in practice fifteen years before, she, under God, owes it, that, after having nursed a child too long, she has still, through mercy, one eye left, to scribble her grateful acknowledgement to her kind benefactors, her sympa thizing friends. Mrs. Berkeley, one morning, carried the prescription herself to Dr. Berkeley's respected surgeon, Mr. Loftie, desiring him to make it up himself, mentioning from whom she had it, acknowledging, as above, that she owed to that gentleman's skill that she had still <span class="hi">one</span> eye. Mr. Loftie exclaimed,<span class="q"> "Then, Madam, <span class="hi">you</span> know Mr. Sharp."</span>I never in my life beheld such another man.

His Mother saw through the wretch; and what added to her anguish was, that two, perhaps, as skilful me dical men as any in England resided at the same town; one of whom always attended Mr. Berkeley's Mother when ill, as she frequently declared to Dr. Berkeley that to <span class="hi">the third</span> she would not trust the life of her Angola cat.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e110184">[Page xci]</span><p>God's ways are unsearchable; but they are all well or ¦ dered for his children, who are enabled to <span class="hi">feel,</span> as well as <span class="hi">say,</span><span class="q"> "All thy ways are Mercy and Truth,"</span>&amp;c. Perhaps few situations have been more distressing than that of Mr. Berkeley's Mother for many weeks. Just at the time when she should have set out to attend her Son at Dover, her tenderly beloved Partner was seized at Cheltenham with a most tremendous disorder, that threatened almost immediate dissolution.

Notwithstanding he was, when Mrs. Berkeley was not present, the <span class="hi">only</span> governor of Mr. Monck Berkeley, yet he ne ver forgot that he was the son of his Master; but always treated him with the respect due from one in an humbler station. <span class="q"> "Sir, you <span class="hi">must not,</span> you <span class="hi">shall not</span> do that.

A wise en couragement this; and it must be wished by every humane person, that it was practised in <span class="hi">every</span> workhouse and poor-house throughout the three kingdoms. At Cookham in Berk shire, where they are remarkably kind to the poor in the workhouse, and most shamefully hard and cruel to those who <span class="hi">strive</span> to keep themselves out of it, the lace-making women and girls, and others, have two pence out of every shilling they earn, and permission to work for their own profit after a certain hour in the evening. This is com forting the hearts of the poor, enabling them to procure a little tea, tobacco, and snuff, which cannot be provided otherwise. Dr. Berkeley has often had his wonderfully fine, tender, feelings soothed, when visiting sick persons in the workhouse, saying, on his return home,<span class="q"> "Well, it is a delight to one's spirit to see those poor people in sheets as white, though not as fine, as one's own, and every comfort that human aid can render."</span>Tea, wine, &amp;c. were always allowed to the sick, if the apothecary said it was necessary. The very worthy Mrs. Lane was then mistress, with a handsome salary. She lived many years in the family of the late Lord Aylesford. Servants, who have lived in genteel families, are the <span class="hi">only proper</span> conductors of workhouses. A butler of the late worthy General Onslow of Cookham was her predecessor.

That look of deep thought, and exquisite benevolence, seldom united in the same soul, seldomer blended in the same countenance, are so astonishingly preserved in the beautiful portrait painted by his beloved friend, Mr. Peters, and by that throughly amiable gentleman presented to Mrs. Berkeley after her Son's death, as to delight all who have a soul capable of en joying the beauties of an exquisite painting. The print prefixed to the Poems is taken from that exquisite painting; but Engraving cannot give the soul like Painting. Mrs. Berkeley esteems herself rich in a most beautiful miniature of her unspeakably dear Son, so small as constantly to be carried in the pocket, taken from Mr. Peters's portrait, by the wonderful, the magic pencil of her excellent accom plished friend, Miss Johnson, of the Paddock-House near Canterbury. Whoever has an eye for fine painting, and has been treated with a fight of that Lady's performances, must be sensible of the happiness of possessing one of a dear departed friend. It can hardly be said departed. He is present, and does every thing but articulate. Such obli gations are not to be repaid. The mines of Brazil, if pos sessed, are not adequate.

He used to say,<span class="q"> "I am God's creature; he sent me into the world <span class="hi">when</span> he pleased, and he will take me out <span class="hi">how</span> he pleases: and I am sure it will be at the <span class="hi">best</span> time, in the <span class="hi">best</span> way."</span>He dreaded nothing in life so much as losing the best of wives, and the being left with two little girls, whom he humoured in <span class="hi">every thing</span> not in itself wrong.</p><p>Some proofs how much Mr. Berkeley was indebted to education may be gathered from his amiable humility as a lad, a youth, and a man, when it is considered that he was astonishingly proud whilst a child.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e216746">[Page clxxii]</span><p>When Mr. Monck Berkeley was aged three years and two months, his father went to reside at Acton near Lon don, a large living, presented to him by his ONLY patron through life, the excellent Archbishop Secker, and which he so nobly resigned, to a man, who, after making him repair the tithe barn, and letting him have about five hun dred pounds 'worth of new furniture and fixtures for an hun dred and eighty pounds — (amongst which was a harpsichord, that cost Bishop Berkeley seventy guineas, for <span class="hi">four pounds</span> — Mrs. Berkeley objected; but the Doctor, with his wonted generosity, said,<span class="q"> "he hated disputes among clergy;"</span>and therefore permitted him to have it at his own price) — after suffering the house to stand empty from Michaelmas to the end of April — came upon him with a long bill for dila pidations, and protested a draught drawn on him by Dr. Berkeley for the money for the furniture. This naturally exasperated the too generous mind that had been the ac tual presenter of the living; for no power on earth, no ho nour, could have compelled any one to resign it.

A man, that is descended from a King rather than from a cobler, from a Hero rather than from a Huckster, may feel grateful to his Maker. Mr. Berkeley's Father felt it, his Grandfather felt it, and perhaps he felt it on becoming a Bishop.

He assured his Father and the gentlemen of the agreeable society of Cook ham above described, that, had they been educated at Eton, they would feel equal indignation. His mother assured him, that men of forty-seven were rarely as irritable as youths of seventeen; to which Mr. Berkeley replied,<span class="q"> "Well, Madam, I can tell you at what page of the book you will throw it by, and not read one line more."</span>She, laughing, asked,<span class="q"> "If Lord Kaimes had abused dear Mrs. Sheeles's school?"</span>He replied,<span class="q"> "Much worse than that: I assure you, my dear Madam, with <span class="hi">all your calmness,</span> you will be ready to throw it into the fire."</span>Mrs. Berkeley requested to be in formed; but her Son politely declined it, saying,<span class="q"> "No; read on, my dear Madam."</span>It is certain, that when she<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e230461">[Page clxxxi]</span> came to the page where Lord Kaimes says,<span class="q"> "I would advise you to be of the Christian religion, because it is (or it happens to be) the religion of the country where you were born,"</span>Mrs. Berkeley verified her Son's prediction, for she never thought it worth while to go on with such a wretch on Education.

It was related to the Editor by a lady incapable of forging it, to whom it was related by an eye and ear witness of the scene. When a divorce has actually taken place, it is no scandal to speak of the di vorced female as having lost her character. Lord Kaimes's daughter was married to Mr. Heron, a gentleman of very large fortune in Scotland, of most excellent cha racter, and uncommonly amiable gentle manners, say all who have the happiness of his acquaintance. The Editor was well acquainted with the elegant worthy Major Heron, his younger brother, when that favourite regiment, of Canterbury families of fashion, the Scotch Greys, were quartered at Canterbury. This lady was at length detected, and gently and quietly sent home to her WORTHY father, with a letter from her excellent injured husband, stating her conduct. She reached her father's house in the afternoon. In the evening, after tea, Lord Kaimes walked up and down the room in silence, but appeared greatly agitated. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e231577">[Page clxxxii]</span>At length he exclaimed,<span class="q"> "Good God, child! how could you act thus?

He once prevailed on his Father to permit him to go, attended by Mr. Wrightson, under a strict promise<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">of doing every thing that John bade him,</span>"</span>to Maidstone, to attend at the assizes. On his return home, he related all the causes and pleadings, and a particular in the summing up the evidence by Sir William Blackstone, as accurately as if he had taken it all down in short-hand, which he could not then do. He was, if the French expression <span class="hi">fort éveillié</span> may be per mitted to be translated into English, the most <span class="hi">awaked</span> of all creatures. <span class="hi">Nothing</span> escaped him; he caught every thing he saw, and wished to know, in a moment. One instance proves it very strongly. Soon after he went to Eton he had a <span class="hi">raging</span> desire to learn to fence, which his Father was <span class="hi">resolved</span> he should <span class="hi">not</span> do, until he attained to a certain age, fixed by him. All Mr. Berkeley's arguments that the Bi shop had let his Father learn at fourteen were ineffectual; Dr. Berkeley saying, that many youths of fashion were often killed by its straining their lungs when they were too tender to bear it. Mr. Berkeley was, however, resolved to learn what he could, as he afterwards told his Father, saying,<span class="q"> "I had little trouble when <span class="hi">I did</span> learn; for I used, instead of going to cricket, &amp;c. to go regularly at the hours of learning, and fix myself like a statue at the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e263243">[Page ccviii]</span> window."</span>Whilst the very worthy, respectable, universally respected Mr. Angelo was instructing his pupils, he used to say,<span class="q"> "I think I hardly came <span class="hi">honestly</span> by my skill in fencing. But Angelo is as worthy, amiable a man as ever lived; and, I dare say, did not grudge me what I so gleaned from his great skill."</span></p><p>When Mr. Berkeley spoke his Prize Exercise in the Par liament Hall at St. Andrews, before the then Chancellor of that University, the late Earl of Kinnoul; when all the prize exercises had been delivered, Lord Kinnoul went to Mr. Berkeley, and, embracing him, said,<span class="q"> "I rejoice, Sir, to embrace the grandson of my dear old friend, Bi shop Berkeley, and to be able to say, that <span class="hi">I</span> never heard speech <span class="hi">so</span> spoken from this pulpit since I have had the honour to be Chancellor here."</span>Mr. Berkeley had redde his prize exercise near fifty times over to his Mother. Just before he went out, he conjured her to hear him once more, that he might lay his emphasis exactly right. The request was complied with.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley, together with his amiable, beloved friend, the late, learned Sir John Ramsey, and his dear friend, Mr. Lennard, frequently spent part of their vacation very pleasantly at Lord Kinnoul's seat. A droll anecdote or two might be here related, particularly a scene in the Library; but this Preface is already too long, and the reader has,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e264344">[Page ccix]</span> perhaps, frequently exclaimed,<span class="q"> "What is all this chit-chat to <span class="hi">me? </span>I wish to read the great actions of great men."</span>If so, according to the advice of the <span class="hi">great</span> Johnson, and the <span class="hi">little</span> Editor, read Sir Francis Knollys's History of the Turks, Marcus Antoninus, &amp;c.</p><p>But to return from this digression. It is impossible to omit an amiable attention of a young Scotch gentleman, who, with his wonderfully sensible younger brother Tho mas, constantly attended the service of the Church of England at Dr. Berkeley's, and who were frequently invited to visit there. The young Laird of Logie-Almon came running into Mrs. Berkeley's dressing-room quite breath less; he threw himself into a chair, and on Mrs. Berkeley's enquiring if he was ill, and asking whether he would have any thing, he replied,<span class="q"> "No, my dear Madam; no.

May he, as a man, through life, be what he was in youth!</p><p>A very extraordinary circumstance happened at the birth of this young gentleman. A very aged domestic of the Drummond family, many years more than an hundred, who lived in a little cot (by the bounty of the excellent Laird) on Logie-Almon estate, as soon as he heard that his dear Laird had a son, walked down about a mile to get a sight of him. He was told the infant was asleep. He re turned the next day. The Laird walked out; Lady Ca tharine feared letting the child be carried out of the room. He returned the day but one following: the Laird <span class="hi">at home,</span> ordered the infant down, to be viewed by worthy old Steel; who, taking him into his arms, said,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace. </span>I thank thee for having permitted me to see (the Editor thinks) the <span class="hi">seventh</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e266873">[Page ccxi]</span> generation of my dear old first master<span id="o5280-n00435_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="A somewhat similar circumstance occurred between two relations of the Editor. &#34;Old Tom Leigh of Iver, the honestest old Tory in England,&#34;aged about n…" href="#o5280-n00435" aria-controls="o5280-n00435" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span style="display:block" class="collapse note  div" id="o5280-n00435"><sup>*</sup> A somewhat similar circumstance occurred between two relations of the Editor. <span class="q"> "Old Tom Leigh of Iver, the <span class="hi">honestest old Tory in England,</span>"</span>aged about ninety — on the birth of the late Colonel Powney, member for Windsor — ordered his coach, and went over to Iver Place, to congratulate his friend Powney. He rejected caudle, cake, &amp;c. and, to the no small amaze ment of Mr. Powney, said,<span class="q"> "Tell your butler to bring us a bottle of wine."</span>The infant was desired to be brought down; when Mr. Leigh, filling out a glass of wine, took the infant's hand, saying,<span class="q"> "Little man, I have come hither on purpose to have the pleasure of drinking a <span class="hi">bottle</span> of wine with <span class="hi">you,</span> the fifth of your family with whom I have enjoyed that pleasure."</span>The Powneys are a short-lived family; the Leighs, in general, very long-lived. The Editor's ancestor of that name lived to a great age.</span>. "</span>The excellent Laird, equally delighted, ordered him refreshment. He walked gently home, sat down in his chair, saying,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">Now I am happy</span>"</span>— and his faithful affectionate spirit took its flight without even a sigh.</p><p>Those medical gentlemen of skill, who heard the above fact (much spoken of at the time) agreed, that had he seen the young Laird on the first day when he went for that purpose, the spirit of the good old man had been freed three days sooner; that his ardent desire had detained it. One has frequently heard of similar instances of the de tention of the spirit in its earthly prison for hours, even days. What a wonder is the spirit of man! How passing wonder HE who implants it in the curiously wrought prison! The late very sensible, unfortunate, Honourable Colonel Nairne, a great collector, who had a fine print of old Steel,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e268301">[Page ccxii]</span> which Mr. Monck Berkeley purchased, with many other cu riosities, after his death, has frequently told the Editor, that the engraver mistook in setting down his age, one hundred and nine, that it ought to have been one hundred and thirty-nine. One cannot help dropping a tear on the la mentable fate of this very accomplished, well-informed man. His father, Lord Nairne, unfortunately engaged in the Re bellion; the son fighting for the Hanover family. The first duty to which he was appointed, was to go and batter down his own noble magnificent castle. His late Majesty, who knew him personally, was very desirous to have given him a regiment and other bounties; but the Duke of Cumberland prevented it, by telling his Majesty it was <span class="hi">impossible</span> a man who had suffered so much could ever forget or forgive it.

Two on each side were generally chosen to speak and oppose; and every one, as in the House of Commons, was permitted to rise and speak on either side.

Two of the Scotch speakers are now in England, the learned, entertaining, Reverend Mr. James Bruce, Mr. Berkeley's tutor, and the gentle, pleasing Mr. William Kemp, tutor to Mr. Lennard, who was many years ago recommended, through Dr. Berkeley's recommendation, by his amiable friend, the late Lord Dacre, into the family of<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e273203">[Page ccxvi]</span> the Earl of Beverley, where his uncommon merits as a tutor are felt, and most generously, most nobly rewarded, by the noble descendant of the great hero of Chevy-Chace.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Berkeley's return to England he began to feel an ardent desire to obtain a seat in Parliament. How was that wish to be gratified? Bishop Berkeley was too generous to amass a fortune. He constantly gave away with both hands. After thirty thousand pounds debt paid by Mr. Berkeley's grandmother, Mrs. Frinsham, and her single sister, Mrs. Cherry, of their grandfather William Cherry, Esquire, and <span class="hi">establishing,</span> instead of taking, (as or dered by him if wanted to pay his debts,) a very good estate left by him to found a charity school in the parish of Bray in Berkshire, where lay a large part of his vast estate<span id="o5280-n00445_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="It would be a pleasantry to say, that the burning of Cliefden's &#34;Proud Alcove&#34; finished it; but, on that conflagration, the other day, went ten thou s…" href="#o5280-n00445" aria-controls="o5280-n00445" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span class="collapse note " id="o5280-n00445"><sup>*</sup> It would be a pleasantry to say, that the burning of Cliefden's "<span class="hi">Proud Alcove</span>" finished it; but, on that conflagration, the other day, went ten thou sand pounds more of old Mr. Cherry's fortune; he having lent the Duke of Buckingham, commonly, justly, called the wicked Duke of Buckingham, that sum to build that delightful mansion. Mr. Berkeley's Mother and Aunt have a note of hand of the Duke for seven thousand pounds. The Editor did not pro duce it as any part of her fortune when she married. The wonder was, that <span class="hi">so very acute</span> a man as old Mr. Cherry certainly was, <span class="hi">should lend to such</span> a man as the Duke of Buckingham, so large a sum, on only a common note of hand. — but Mr. Cherry was immensely rich, and lent to every one of his friends that asked him — accordingly his great-grand-daughter finds <span class="hi">some</span> of her kind friends much more ready to <span class="hi">lend</span> than <span class="hi">she is to borrow</span> — for which may GOD reward them here and hereafter.</span>. The South-Sea bubble had, although not beggared,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e274649">[Page ccxvii]</span> yet wonderfully reduced the large remainder of Mr. Cher ry's fortune; so that, during the life of Mr. Berkeley's Mo ther, he could not get a qualification that would sit easy on <span class="hi">his</span> conscience. His Mother, on learning this, offered to give up <span class="hi">entirely</span> into his hands her whole settlement, adding,<span class="q"> "I have, from your infancy, ever said, 'If <span class="hi">I must be</span> abso lutely dependant on any fallen child of Adam, may it be on Berkeley! not on dear sweet Robert; for Berkeley has a generosity of soul that <span class="hi">I</span> have never seen in any human being, through my whole life, but in himself alone."</span>On saying this he exclaimed,<span class="q"> "Jesus avert that I should be SUCH a villian. No; I would, were it ne cessary, sooner carry a brown musket, than ever touch a six-pence of your settlement. It is too small, we all know. No; never whilst my name is Berkeley, will I ever di minish it. It may, I hope, please God that I may live to <span class="hi">add</span> to it."</span></p><p>On his coming home at vacation-time, he often men tioned curious causes at Westminster Hall and the Old Bai ley. His Father one day said,<span class="q"> "Berkeley, it does not seem to me that you go often to the House of Commons. I should think that you would be there perpetually."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley. —<span class="q"> "My dear Sir, I never go at all."</span></p><p>Dr. B. —<span class="q"> "Never go. How is that?

"</span>It must here be said, that Mr. Berkeley was a<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e278246">[Page ccxix]</span> strenuous assertor of Mr. Hastings's innocence. He had put himself to considerable expence to procure documents from India, and had prepared for the press, perhaps as ela borate an investigation of Mr. Hastings's conduct and cha racter, as beautiful a defence as was ever penned, which he, however, the day before it was to be sent to the press, sacrificed to paternal authority. He brought it to the Edi tor, and, with tears in his eyes, threw it on her table, say ing,<span class="q"> "There is a <span class="hi">sacrifice to duty. </span>I beseech you to take care of it.

When at his Fa ther's, he retired soon after dinner, and immediately after tea. As he very seldom ate any supper, as soon as the cloth was removed, his servant notified it to him, and he came down and entertained his friends with his enliven ing conversation, and sometimes delighted the soul of his Mother, by complying with her request to sing to her the hymn sung by the Eton College gentlemen.

At Ranelagh, the Ridotto, &amp;c. her Ladyship never failed to find them out, come to them, and make the kindest en quiries. A woman of quality once, at an installation at Windsor, said to Mrs. Berkeley, then Miss Frinsham,<span class="q"> "How comes it that <span class="hi">you</span> visit Lady<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>?

In the year 1787, during the long vacation, Mr. Berkeley, with two of his Temple friends, J. R. Baker, Esquire, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and another, very sensible, amiable, young gentleman, now no more, took a trip to the continent. During their residence there, Mr. Berkeley had it in his power to assist, in a very awkward and unplea sant situation, a very worthy amiable personage of very high rank, his Serene Highness the then reigning Prince of Saxe Gotha, uncle to the King of England. The circumstances attending this transaction are too long to be related here. In the vessel the Prince saw and admired Mr. Berkeley's wonderfully curious Highland dog of a very scarce breed, so much as to make Mr. Berkeley often regret that he could not prevail upon himself to present him to his Serene High ness; but adding,<span class="q"> "My faithful companion so many hun dred miles, in so many different countries, I found I could not part with OSCAR."</span>Mr. Berkeley's honest Scot, Richie, did the honours of Oscar, told his serene Highness many wonderful, yet actually true, stories of the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e293965">[Page ccxxxiii]</span> sagacity, fidelity, <span class="hi">prudence,</span> of that lovely beast. On the discovery of the Duke's rank, poor Ritchie said to his master,<span class="q"> "Laird, Sir, what an a sad thing it is that I must lave ye!"</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley. —<span class="q"> "Leave me, Ritchie! Why must you leave me? Have you got a better place, laddy?"</span></p><p>Ritchie. —<span class="q"> "No, Sir, no; but I can never go back to England."</span></p><p>Mr. B. —<span class="q"> "Why not, Ritchie?"</span></p><p>Ritchie. —<span class="q"> "Why, Sir, that elderly gentleman that talked so much to you is the King's uncle: Laird have mercy upon me, and that ever <span class="hi">I</span> should not know it, and should dare to talk to him so about the dog — to be sure, the King will have me hanged if I go back to England. I will stay till you go, and then contrive, if I can, to slip into Scotland."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley answered for his Majesty; but some of Mr. Berkeley's English friends, to divert themselves, encouraged poor Ritchie's fears. His Serene Highness at parting ex pressed his gratitude for Mr. Berkeley's services, and most condescendingly said,<span class="q"> "I find, Sir, that you are a great traveller. I hope, sometime or other, that curiosity (al though we have not much of curious) may lead you to my Court, where I shall be most happy to return your<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e295010">[Page ccxxxiv]</span> wonderfully kind attentions to me by every respect in my power."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley used often to say,<span class="q"> "Ritchie is a true Scot, he will not own that he sees (like the pumkins in the<span id="o5280-n00480_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="The well-known story of the English gentleman's ordering his gardener to tie pumkins on a pear tree — and the foolish vain Scot saying he had seen the…" href="#o5280-n00480" aria-controls="o5280-n00480" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span style="display:block" class="collapse note  div" id="o5280-n00480"><sup>*</sup> The well-known story of the English gentleman's ordering his gardener to tie pumkins on a pear tree — and the foolish vain Scot saying he had seen the like<span class="q"> "in the Duke of Argyle's garden in Scotland."</span>No person is ridiculous for <span class="hi">unavoidable</span> ignorance — every person, of every nation, for pretending to knowledge they do not possess.</span> Duke of Argyle's garden) any thing of any kind better in England than in Scotland. "</span>One day, when Mr. Berkeley came down to dinner, he said,<span class="q"> "Well, I must confess, Ritchie has at length vanquished me, just when I plumed myself on victory. As he was dressing my hair, just now, it occurred to me I will ask Richie, if ever he saw a crusade in Scotland, and see if he will answer, O yes, Sir, in the <span class="hi">Loodons,</span> i. e. the Lothians. I put the question, Ritchie, did you ever see a crusade?"</span></p><p>Ritchie. —<span class="q"> "Crusade, Sir? what an a thing is it? is it any beasty?"</span><span class="hi">i. e.</span> a beast.</p><p>Mr. B. —<span class="q"> "No; it is a great number of people collected together to go to Jerusalem to recover it out of the hands of the Infidels."</span></p><p>Ritchie. —<span class="q"> "O! yes, Sir; I have seen that in the Loo dons (his native county). When you were in Edinburgh last, you gave me leave to visit my friends; and I heard<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e296228">[Page ccxxxv]</span> of them, and went to the wood where they were all waiting to go to Jerusalem."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley then recollected to have heard in Edin burgh, that there were a few deluded poor creatures who had assembled themselves in a wood, expecting to be con veyed through the air to the Holy Land. Their numbers increased prodigiously afterwards, as was related, and a long account was given of them in some Magazine, the Editor thinks the Gentleman's. What became of these poor de luded souls she does not recollect to have heard; but Mr. Berkeley, laughing, said,<span class="q"> "I must now give it up as a gone cause, the hope of finding out any thing Ritchie has not seen in the Loodons."</span></p><p>The PUBLICATOR, as mentioned before, very soon found out that he did not like the situation of his living. Poor Dr. Berkeley was <span class="hi">worried</span> to besiege good Archbishop Secker to exchange it for another; one with a better house, and <span class="hi">much</span> better income, was soon given to this<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">particular,</span>"</span>this GRATEFUL friend; where he commenced his ac quaintance, and, by the <span class="hi">elegance</span> of his manners, soon formed that <span class="hi">intimacy</span> with the present Sir Edward Dering, Baronet, of Surrenden, which, for many months, afforded so much amusement in West Kent, and even in East Kent. His contentions with that gentleman, concerning game, could not be that he might send some to his friend, Dr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e297298">[Page ccxxxvi]</span> Berkeley; for he never, in his whole life, sent him even a lark.</p><p>Some time after the PUBLICATOR had been gratified by the exchange of his living, Dr. Berkeley went, as he frequently did, to make a visit of some weeks at Lambeth. The first day at dinner his Grace accosted him thus:<span class="q"> "Dr. Berkeley, I HEAR that your friend Mr. <span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>has been in town for about a fortnight. <span class="hi">I hear</span> it, for I can not say <span class="hi">I saw</span> him. He did not find his way to Lam beth. "</span>Poor Dr. Berkeley sat abashed at, as he termed it, the brutal folly, to say nothing of the <span class="hi">ingratitude,</span> of this <span class="hi">particular</span> friend, and replied,<span class="q"> "I hope that your Grace must have been misinformed."</span>—<span class="q"> "No, my good young gentleman, I have not been misinformed;" (then quickening his voice, as he frequently did;) "for he was seen driving over Westminster-bridge in a hackney-coach," (the <span class="hi">Publicator</span> had not <span class="hi">then</span> a carriage of his own;) "and," (quickening his voice still more) "in <span class="hi">many</span> other parts of the town."</span>To this no answer could <span class="hi">possibly</span> be made. A <span class="hi">mourne silence</span> followed, until broken by that loveliest of women, the angelic, the incomparable Miss Talbot, who, to relieve her distressed friend, introduced some <span class="hi">pleasanter</span> subject, than the marvellous (as Dr. Berkeley termed it) conduct of the <span class="hi">particular</span> friend. Dr. Berkeley, at his return home, appeared extemely chagrined on re lating it.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e298429">[Page ccxxxvii]</span><p>Some time after, on taxing the <span class="hi">Publicator</span> with his un accountably strange conduct, he excused himself very <span class="hi">cle verly,</span> by saying,<span class="q"> "Aye, I believe I should have gone, but I had not time; for, to tell you the truth, <span class="hi">I</span> went to London (always to a friend's house) to shew <span class="hi">Beely</span> and <span class="hi">Peggy</span> the wax-work, and the monuments, and the lions, and every thing."</span>It was very lucky that it did not occur to him to carry <span class="hi">Beely</span> and <span class="hi">Peggy</span> to <span class="hi">dinner</span> with his Grace on a <span class="hi">public</span> day, and shew them the Lollards Tower there.</p><p>The <span class="hi">Publicator</span> seems to have taken pains to tack at the very end of the list of Bishop Horne's friend's Dr. (then George Berkeley, Esquire) — a <span class="hi">real</span> Esquire, from his poor, <span class="hi">unknown</span> Father's rank in life, and expending every year at Oxford, as he has repeatedly told the Editor, — not in vice, She is sure, as his excellent Father said, when, on his arrival in Oxford, Dr. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "I am ashamed, my Lord, to say that I have spent six hundred pounds in four months — here is the account."</span>The Bishop made the above generous reply,<span class="q"> "Not in vice, I am sure, child,"</span>and threw the account into the fire. It was great part in virtue. A servant to wait on himself, and a groom for his horses, could not be reckoned extravagant. A young man, who never tasted wine, could not spend more than a thousand pounds <span class="hi">per annum;</span> but, having never been, according to his Son, <span class="hi">buffeted</span> through a public school, and being quite unacquainted with charac ters, he was perpetually imposed on by designing, ungrate ful,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e299729">[Page ccxxxviii]</span> young men, to whom he was <span class="hi">too</span> bountiful, as appears by his accounts, now in the Editor's possession, from the day he arrived at Christ Church. He is receiving his re ward; <span class="hi">they,</span> no doubt, <span class="hi">will</span> receive theirs. Much went in charity to real, frequently unknown, objects.</p><p>The Editor has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley say, that one morning at Christ Church, his servant shaving him, he redde a sermon preached on charity for lying-in women in Aldersgate-Street. The preacher, the Editor thinks a Pre late, described the miseries of <span class="hi">poor</span> women in those circum stances so pathetically, that Dr. Berkeley said<span class="q"> "I, a young man, had never thought on. I felt it so strongly, that, with one half of my chin unshaved, I made my servant lay down the razor, catched up a sheet of paper, wrote to my banker an order to pay to the treasure of the hospital fifty pounds, to make me a governor for life, for fear I should be at any time unwilling to pay the annual sub scription."</span></p><p>Some Scotch friend, the Editor has not been able to dis discover who has celebrated Dr. Berkeley's charities to the poor, during his <span class="hi">séjour</span> with his Son at the University of St. Andrew's, saying,<span class="q"> "that he every year gave away above two hundred pounds with his own hands."</span>This is a mistake. He very seldom did give with his own elegant hands, unless his wife's may be called his own; for unless,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e300856">[Page ccxxxix]</span> which was frequently the case, he inclosed in a blank cover a ten, often a twenty pound bank note, to any person, una ble to <span class="hi">ask,</span> though not to <span class="hi">receive</span> charity, whose face he had never seen, only heard from good authority of their distress. How often has he thus<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">made the widow's heart to sing for joy,</span>"</span>and with holy Job<span class="q"> "the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon him."</span>In other instances, with regard to the surrounding poor, he always left the pleasing task on Mrs. Berkeley; constantly saying,<span class="q"> "I never trouble myself; my wife is my almoner;"</span>adding, as Mrs. Berkeley once said to her excellent kind friend Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury, on his asking her con cerning a poor old man,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">I</span> know nothing of him; when <span class="hi">once</span> I have introduced an object of charity to you, or Mrs. Tatton, (one of the charitable daughters of the <span class="hi">nobly</span> charitable Dean and Mrs. Lynch,) <span class="hi">I</span> never trouble myself <span class="hi">any more</span> about them, but search out some new objects, well knowing that <span class="hi">they</span> will have ample abundant care taken of <span class="hi">them.</span>"</span></p><p>A Scotch minister was once celebrating to Mrs. Berkeley the <span class="hi">vast</span> charities of the LATE Earl of Lauderdale — a very worthy Nobleman HE was.

And to this, that he kept open house for rich and poor; and when the silk manufactory (now, alas! no more) was at a low ebb, he nobly asked, 'Will my new furnishing the deanery with silk damask help to raise it?' and being answered in the affirmative, he instantly ordered five hundred pounds worth of furni ture damask to be wove, which saved it at that time."</span></p><p>It is to be hoped, when a score or two more of ladies have been burnt to death by wearing muslin gowns in win ter (<span class="hi">absurd, ridiculous, foolish</span> fashions) that the Editor's poor honest <span class="hi">quondam</span> neighbours may again use their looms.

It is com monly said, that in the county of Berks during the partridge season there are as many guns as birds; therefore game is always a most agreeable present, especially to those who keep much company; and frequently, in their several sea sons, would arrive hares, partridges, pheasants, &amp;c. from the very grateful Mr. Andrews, of Marden in Kent. He never suffered any neighbour to go to London without re questing him to take some game, and send it down by the Maidenhead coach. The year that Archbishop Secker presented Mr. Andrews to this living, apples sailed in every county of England except Kent; which is no great wonder, since the farmers of that county pay most careful attention to their trees in winter, clearing them of all dead wood, moss, &amp;c. Mr. Andrews packed up his whole crop of apples in hampers, and sent them all, except a <span class="hi">very few</span> stinted ones. Apples that year were such rarities, that Mrs. Berkeley suggested to Dr. Berkeley to send them to Lambeth Palace; which was speedily done, a few only be ing reserved as curiosities; and a most acceptable offering they proved. Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley going to make some stay at Lambeth Palace soon after, the first day after din ner from some apples being on the table, the Archbishop, with<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e305253">[Page ccxliii]</span> his wonted politeness, said,<span class="q"> "Lady and Gentleman, will you not eat some of your <span class="hi">own</span> fine apples? How came it to pass that <span class="hi">your</span> trees produced this wonderfully scarce year?"</span>To which Dr. Berkeley replied,<span class="q"> "Alas! my good Lord, we had not a score on all our trees.

He was at least <span class="hi">modest,</span> if ungrateful.</p><p>It is not possible to avoid contrasting two men, both of whom were indebted for their first comfortable establish ment in life to the exquisite amiability of Dr. Berkeley the Reverend Dr. Glasse and the PUBLICATOR. When Mr. Monck Berkeley was about six or seven years old, Dr. Glasse said, more than once,<span class="q"> "If you and Mrs. Berkeley would confide your little man to me, how happy should I be! what care and attention I would pay him! and I am sure, if you would condescend to <span class="hi">accept</span> it, I desire neither fee nor reward."</span>The last grateful offer was of course thankfully declined; and from Mr. Berkeley's birth his Father determined, that, if God spared his life, he should be educated at a Public School; often lamenting that the good Bishop had not sent <span class="hi">him</span> to one, particularly after his son grew up, often saying,<span class="q"> "he had then got a second guardian."</span>Bishop Berkeley, at one time, for se veral years paid four hundred pounds <span class="hi">per annum</span> to different masters to instruct his children in Music, Painting, Fencing, Riding, and French; the Latin and Greek he entrusted to none but himself. His sons were never suffered either to ride or walk out unattended by a careful servant.</p><p>When Dr. Berkeley came to Oxford, at the age of nine teen, attended by a most respectable worthy Chaplain of<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e307639">[Page ccxlv]</span> his Father's, and his own servant, he had never rode a mile alone; and he had contracted an habit of meditating and composing on horseback, which occasioned his being the most careless of riders, leaving the horse's bridle so very loose, that he was perpetually thrown. Soon after his marriage, Mrs. Berkeley, finding this to be the case, made it a point that he never should ride without a servant. When Mr. Berkeley grew up, he joined in what Dr. Berke ley called his Mother's <span class="hi">persecution,</span> and one day said,<span class="q"> "What is the reason, I would fain know, why your Mother lets you ride fifty miles without a servant, and over hedge and ditch, nobody knows where, hunting, and won't let me ride to Taplow or Maidenhead alone?"</span>To which Mr. Berkeley replied,<span class="q"> "Ah! my dear Sir, if <span class="hi">you</span> had been <span class="hi">buffeted</span> for seven years though Eton School, <span class="hi">I dare say, my</span> Mother would have let you ride alone as<span id="o5280-n00495_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Mr. Berkeley constantly hunted with buck-hounds twice a week — frequently with Mr. Clayton's hounds.

These ejaculations were frequently continued till the afternoon. They were certainly heard by HIM who heareth prayer, and, as it should seem, answered; for Mr. Berkeley never once got a fall in hunting — he rode remarkably well. "</span>He never would cross his Majesty in the chase. He used frequently to express indignation at a hunting butcher, particularly well mounted, who used to cross so as sometimes to endanger his Majesty; saying,<span class="q"> "What can the fellow be made of, to be such a savage?"</span>to which Dr. Berkeley used to say,<span class="q"> "Why, of bulls hides, to be sure."</span></span> quietly as she<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e309154">[Page ccxlvi]</span> does me; but that is out of the question, for ride alone you must not; that is agreed on all hands.

We have seen his kind offer, in the preceding page; we will now proceed to the PUBLICATOR's polite re fusal. When Archbishop Cornwallis visited at Canterbury, he was of course at the Deanery. It was impossible that the attendant Bishop should be also lodged there. On a consultation concerning the place where he should be re ceived and entertained, not one of the Prebendaries seemed desirous of that honour. The generous hospitable Dr. Lynch was not then a member of the choir; and it must in justice be said, that numbers of the Prebendaries, who are not in office, let their prebendal houses, and are only visitors or boarders to their tenants; so they have it not in their power to receive any one. It was suggested that the Pre late must be contented to go to one of the miserably bad, excessively dear, inns in the city. This shocked Dr. Berkeley, although only the son of a poor UNKNOWN Irish Prelate; and he instantly said,<span class="q"> "Bad as my house is, it is better than a nasty dirty inn; he shall be my guest."</span>As soon as it was known who the attending Bishop was, Dr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e310378">[Page ccxlvii]</span> Berkeley wrote a polite letter, requesting the honour of having his Lordship for his guest. Mrs. Berkeley requested her amiable consort to permit her to invite his lady, with whom she had the honour to be acquainted, and whose lovely eldest sister, sweet, beautiful Miss Maddox, was a beloved friend of her childhood. Bishop Maddox, when a Welsh bishop, had for several summers a house at East Burnham, in the neighbourhood of White Waltham. That lovely creature died early. The Editor cherishes, with tender care, a keepsake, a small silver medal, given by the good Bishop to his sweet daughter, to present to her little friend.</p><p>Some days before the arrival of the Archbishop, &amp;c. Dr. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "the children (then both living at home and going to Dr. Beauvoir's school) will be horridly in the servants 'way, for we must keep open house for a fortnight. What can we do with them?"</span>Mrs. Berke ley said,<span class="q"> "She would contrive it as well as she could: they should get a cold dinner at one, and be off to play di rectly."</span>Mrs. Frinsham, then at Dr. Berkeley's, said,<span class="q"> "You know I am going to Ramsgate, and I will take <span class="hi">one.</span>"</span>It was Dr. Berkeley replied,<span class="q"> "You are very kind; you shall take Robert: and it has just occurred to me that I will send Berkeley to *****; HE will be glad of an opportunity of obliging ME."</span>Dr. Berkeley was, alas! ever too apt to judge of others by his amiable self. De lighted<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e311547">[Page ccxlviii]</span> with this idea, he wrote to the PUBLICATOR, stating his situation, and saying,<span class="q"> "On such a day John will deliver into your care my eldest boy for a fortnight; at the expiration of which I shall fetch him home."</span>By the return of the post, Dr. Berkeley received a letter from the PUBLICATOR, saying,<span class="q"> "that he was very sorry that it so happened that he could not possibly receive his little<span id="o5280-n00500_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Nor spelt, but always so pronounced, by the elegant Publicator, when speaking of the young gentlemen his boarders — &#34;My bouys&#34;— or of his own son, who…" href="#o5280-n00500" aria-controls="o5280-n00500" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>*</sup></a></span><span style="display:block" class="collapse note  div" id="o5280-n00500"><sup>*</sup> Nor spelt, but always so pronounced, by the <span class="hi">elegant</span> Publicator, when speaking of the young gentlemen his boarders —<span class="q"> "My bouys"</span>— or of his own son, who was a remarkably elegant lad. The Editor has not seen him since he was a very pleasing youth, when she advised his father, in return for the Latin and Greek he taught his son, to make him teach him a little politeness. Dr. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "Nobody flatters ***** like <span class="hi">my wife;</span>"</span>on which Mrs. Berkeley fired, and said,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">I</span> flatter him! how can you say so?"</span>—<span class="q"> "Nay, I will prove it; for, whenever he is here, you won't suffer any body else to speak; but say, do pray hold you tongueS, that <span class="hi">I</span> may hear what ***** says,"</span>about Botany, Farming, &amp;c. in which he is well skilled.</span> <span class="hi">bouy;</span> but that he had just settled all matters to take his pupils to the sea, to shew them the shipping, and give them a week's pleasure; — it was unlucky, but it could not be helped. "</span>Dr. Berkeley flew with this letter to Mrs. Berkeley, saying,<span class="q"> "Well, this is the luckiest thing in the world;"</span>then redde the epistle; observing,<span class="q"> "it will make Berkeley" (just then turned of eleven years old, and, as an excellent judge used to say, "the best-bred properly behaved child of that age in England; no af fected manly airs, but a sweetly polite lad") "as happy as a prince, poor fellow."</span>Dr. Berkeley notified this by letter immediately to the PUBLICATOR, who <span class="hi">instantly</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e313071">[Page ccxlix]</span> returned the following <span class="hi">elegant, grateful,</span> answer. The let ter is carefully preserved. <span class="q"> "My dear Friend, (his constant familiar address to Dr. Berkeley,) <span class="hi">I cannot</span> help thinking <span class="hi">you very unreasonable,</span> in wanting to fasten your Son upon <span class="hi">me,</span> especially at a time when I have told you, that <span class="hi">I cannot</span> take him."</span>The letter goes on in the same <span class="hi">ele gant</span> style. Poor Dr. Berkeley was, for the time, <span class="hi">very, very</span> angry indeed; and Mrs. Berkeley <span class="hi">maliciously</span> laughed at the <span class="hi">gratitude</span> of his <span class="hi">dear Friend. </span>After some time, Dr. Berkeley wrote a letter to the Publicator; and, as was frequently his custom, when going out to dinner, passing from his study, threw half a dozen letters on the table in Mrs. Berkeley's dressing-room, saying,<span class="q"> "I am in haste; I shall be distanced; pray seal these unsealed ones; and send them all; with, yours, to post."</span>The letter to the <span class="hi">grate ful</span> Friend was safely sealed; and Mrs. Berkeley, having very little of our grandmother Eve's curiosity in her com position, did not ask permission to read it; but, hollowing it up, she, with a good pen, wrote, as plainly as she could contrive to do, the little word <span class="hi">gratitude. </span>Off went the letter to the post. In a few days Dr. Berkeley, coming into the drawing-room to tea, said,<span class="q"> "I have got a letter from *****, in which he seems much disquieted. He asks what could possibly induce some member of my family to write on the edge of the inside of the letter I last wrote to him the word <span class="hi">gratitude. </span>My dear, do you know any thing about it?"</span>Mrs. Berkeley, from her cradle, to (she<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e314372">[Page ccl]</span> trusts) her coffin, too proud to tell a lie, instantly replied,<span class="q"> "To be sure I do; for <span class="hi">I</span> wrote it."</span>— Dr. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "Why would you write?"</span>—<span class="q"> "Because <span class="hi">I</span> think it a <span class="hi">mighty pretty word.</span>"</span>—<span class="q"> "Your wrath against *****, like most violent blazes, has abated."</span></p><p>The Editor cannot dismiss the PUBLICATOR without re marking, that, had it pleased the Divine Goodness to have spared Dr. Berkeley to have seen the contempt <span class="hi">endeavoured</span> to be thrown on his very deeply-learned, justly, universally admired Father, his indignation would <span class="hi">not</span> have subsided, as it for some time did, on account of his little Son. Dr. Berkeley never did, never would, forgive a greater man than even the Publicator, for speaking, as he thought, im properly against his excellent Father; for which great man and his incomparable writings he had through life the greatest respect,<span class="q"> "RAMBLER John,"</span>as Dr. Berkeley, who generally redde a Rambler once a week, termed that great man. His Son always called him the noble learned Bear. The accident happening at Oxford was too well known then, too well remembered by many gentlemen then present, still living, to be here detailed. Suffice it therefore to say, that Johnson's want of <span class="hi">le savoir vivre</span> occasioned his ridi culing Bishop Berkeley's American scheme, by which he meant to introduce Episcopacy there, always declaring,<span class="q"> "if it was not done in a few years, the Colonies would revolt from the Mother Country."</span>The event has shown that this<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e315516">[Page ccli]</span> <span class="hi">unknown</span> Prelate was not a <span class="hi">false</span> Prophet. What the Father could not accomplish, the Son contrived to bring about, by his interest with the Scotch Bishops; the very excellent, very deeply learned Bishop Skinner; the very pious Bishop Falconer, who died soon after; and the amiable worthy Sir John Strachan, Baronet; as now that he is no more may be <span class="hi">publicly</span> known. In a letter to a Friend, written some time after, Dr. Berkeley says,<span class="q"> "I was well aware that it would <span class="hi">never</span> be forgiven, but I rejoice that I have done it."</span></p><p>Dr. Berkeley selt his amiable heart gratified in rendering every possible service in his power to the repeal of Lord Hardwicke's horrid act after the Rebellion in 1745. Had Dr. Berkeley's advice been adhered to, the first attempt had succeeded, when the three Scotch Prelates came over the first time to solicit it; but in most transactions there is generally a Marplot. Dr. Berkeley was particularly happy in entertaining at his house in Berkshire, and endeavouring to return the very polite hospitality of Sir John Strachan to himself and family at Dundee, and of Bishop Skinner to his Son when at Aberdeen, where Mr. Monck Berkeley had the freedom of the city presented to him, as he had of se veral other cities and towns in Scotland, and a licence pre sented to shoot on very manor wherever he went. He spent near a fortnight at Taymouth most agreeably. The Editor fears to trust her once retentive, now, alas! trea cherous<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e316653">[Page cclii]</span> memory, to say, of sixteen gentlemen who sat down to dinner, every day, how many were John Campbell. This came out accidentally. Some one, not knowing Mr. Berke ley's partiality for Scotland, said,<span class="q"> "How ridiculous they are, calling themselves by the names of their estates!"</span>Mr. Berkeley reddened, and said,<span class="q"> "Pray, Sir, why so? how would you have them distinguish themselves?"</span>—<span class="q"> "Why, by their Christian names, as we do."</span>—<span class="q"> "That will not do, Sir. The mode of distinguishing several brothers in a public school, <span class="hi">major, minor,</span> &amp;c. will not do; nor will <span class="hi">first, second, third,</span> do."</span>He then men tioned as above related. The worthy learned Laird of Aha ladar (certainly not spelt right by the Editor, although so pronounced) and his accomplished, amiable, eldest son, both much beloved by Mr. Berkeley were two of near half a score John Campbells. Mr. Berkeley retained a most grateful sense of the kind, elegant hospitality at Ahaladar. Talking frequently, after his return from College, of Jack Ahaladar, his brother asked,<span class="q"> "Who is Jack Ahaladar, of whom you talk so much?"</span><span class="q"> "Why, the <span class="hi">young</span> Laird, a charming young man — YOU would like <span class="hi">him.</span>"</span>— Probably now the elegant Laird of Ahaladar, as the Editor thinks she was told the worthy old Laird is dead. He presented Mr. Berkeley with a very curious original letter, which, when the Editor can afford to print the second volume of Literary Relics, will be published in it.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e317809">[Page ccliii]</span><p>To return from this digression. Dr. Johnson had no sooner finished his rude sentence, than Dr. (then Mr.) Berke ley, then a little turned of twenty, rose from his seat, reached his cap, made his bow, and, to the no small distress of the gentleman who had invited him to meet Dr. Johnson, quitted the room in great indignation before supper. On some of the company, intimates of Dr. John son, reproaching him for his<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>conduct, HE made a sort of <span class="hi">amende honorable,</span> by saying,<span class="q"> "Why, I think the Bishop's scheme no bad one; but I abused it, to take down the young gentleman, lest he should be too vain of having had SUCH A FATHER."</span>Some one presumed to say Mr. Berkeley was exquisitely well-bred, not at all insolent; to which he replied,<span class="q"> "No, not at all, but I thought it might do him good to mortify him <span class="hi">a little.</span>"</span>Dr. Johnson wished to have written the Bishop's life; but Dr. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "he would not furnish him with any documents;"</span>which Mr. Monck Berkeley used exceedingly to regret, saying to his Father,<span class="q"> "My dear Sir, it will never be so written as Johnson would have written it;"</span>to which Dr. Berkeley used to reply,<span class="q"> "It may be so; but I was resolved HE should not write it. You may, if you please."</span>Dr. Johnson, through a com mon friend, made many attempts to visit Dr. Berkeley in Berkshire, and once said,<span class="q"> "I have a good mind to go down to Cookham, and see what they would say to me."</span>Mrs. Berkeley hoped that her beloved partner would have said,<span class="q"> "We should be very happy to see him;"</span>but his reply was<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e319117">[Page ccliv]</span><span class="q"> "No; the man that could speak slightingly of my great Father shall never be entertained under his Son's roof."</span>It is therefore probable, that this respectful mention of Bishop Berkeley by the PUBLICATOR would have completed the business begun by the smothering of the Consecration Sermon for four years.</p><p>Dr. Berkeley preserved all the letters he received, except now and then one, which he flung into the fire before he appeared to have redde it through; and, like his Father and Dean Swift, some he never opened at all, but threw them into a drawer. After his lamented death, the Editor found a baker's dozen (fourteen) from a fleecing Ingrate, with the seal unbroken, as she told the man when obliged to hold a short conversation with him. It has been often said of the Editor's grandfather, the celebrated Francis Cherry, Esquire, that he met with more Ingrates than any other man ever did. I suppose of most persons of very large fortunes and very liberal minds, it may, with equal truth, be as serted. Dr. Berkeley's fortune was by no means large, but his <span class="hi">soul</span> was noble. He, by his wise advice and direction, made the fortunes of great numbers. Mrs. Berkeley used often to say to him,<span class="q"> "My dear friend, you can make the fortune of every one you take in hand, but your self and your Son, and you will not stir a stroke for <span class="hi">him.</span>"</span>His reply constantly was,<span class="q"> "I cannot help it.

One night at Brooks's he and his learned beloved Eton St. Andrew's friend, the learned T. Hobhouse, Esquire, were drawn in to play deeper than Mr. Berkeley, at least, ought to have done. The amiable, worthy Mr. Hobhouse has a very good maternal estate. Mr. Berkeley, as is usual, won a frightfully large sum, soon lost it again, and all the money in his purse, and much more than he had at his chambers to pay it. Very providentially Mrs. Frinsham happened to be in town. Early the next morning he posted off to Duke Street. Mrs. Frinsham, somewhat surprized at hearing from her servant that Mr. Berkeley was come before nine o'clock, went out to him; the case was related, and that generous friend instantly enabled him to discharge his <span class="hi">first,</span> his <span class="hi">last, gaming</span> debt; telling him,<span class="q"> "that she never felt such pleasure arising from having money at command."</span>She has, in her youth, often re lieved so very largely, as to deny herself for months the elegant necessaries of young ladies, to accommodate a particular friend, or an old acquaintance. Mr. Berkeley going down soon after to his father's, on the evening of his arrival, asked his Mother,<span class="q"> "If she had heard what a <span class="hi">fool</span> her son had been;"</span>to which she replying,<span class="q"> "That she did not recollect having ever heard him called a fool by any one, but his <span class="hi">Father</span> and <span class="hi">Mother</span> now and then;"</span>he related the above-mentioned circumstance, adding,<span class="q"> "My dear Mother, you may set <span class="hi">your heart at rest</span> from any fear of your Son's ever becoming a gamester; <span class="hi">for, as soon</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e337593">[Page cclxix]</span> <span class="hi">as</span> I got home to the Temple, I kneeled down, and be sought God to cast out my prayer if EVER I again played for any sum more than I could well afford to lose, play ing now and then with one's neighbours in the country on a winter evening."</span>It has, I believe, been mentioned above, that Mr. Berkeley, whenever he did play, which was very seldom, and a very indifferent whist-player he was, almost constantly won. — All his winnings went to relieve the poor.</p><p>But to return: Dr. Berkeley told his son that Dr. L<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>acted highly right, and that he should have esteemed it rather a compliment than a punishment. To which he replied,<span class="q"> "No, NO, Sir, not if you had ever been at school, and knew <span class="hi">what</span> it was to lose a place.

Some time before her death, the servant went into the room where they were at breakfast, saying, that<span class="q"> "Master would not eat his mess for breakfast, but wanted coffee, <span class="hi">like</span> his Mamma."</span>— Up sprang his Father, saying,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">I will give him coffee!</span>"</span>went and gave him a good whipping — still the mess was refused — a second whipping, with no better success — at length a third, when his mother called out,<span class="q"> "Mr. Frinsham, let him alone, if he won't eat it now, he will eat it when he is hungry, don't whip him any more."</span>—<span class="q"> "I will whip him till <span class="hi">to-morrow morning</span> if he does not eat it before."</span>The Editor has frequently heard her father say,<span class="q"> "that he had resolved to endure se ven or eight flagellations;"</span>but the declaration,<span class="q"> "that they should be continued until the next morning"</span>determined him to eat it immediately, which he ac cordingly did, always observing, how wise it was to break children of stubbornness in their infancy. It pro bably eradicated it in Mr. Frinsham; for a sweeter tem pered child never lived, as the Editor has frequently heard a worthy woman declare, who went to keep his father's house, on the death of his Mother — she lived to near ninety, and always made an annual visit at Mr. and after his death at Mrs. Frinsham's — that<span class="q"> "he was the most amia ble of children, and of youths."</span>When Mr. Frinsham sent his sons to Oxford, this careful servant went to take care of another, and a third set of poor motherless children; by which means, and the little bounties of her adopted<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e339978">[Page cclxxi]</span> children, she obtained sufficient to maintain her more than decently, genteely. She was ever a parlour guest in all the gentlemen's families whom she had brought up. She had by her father, in very early youth, been married to a gentleman who deserted her, and went to live abroad; she was therefore a <span class="hi">safe</span> housekeeper for young widowers. Her first service was Mr. Frinsham's Father's. The Editor has frequently, since she grew up, heard her say,<span class="q"> "that her mother, going to visit her soon after she went thither, addressed her thus: 'My dear child, this is a very heavy charge that you have taken upon yourself. If you do not take the utmost care, the <span class="hi">same</span> care of these beautiful little children (Mr. Frinsham's younger brother was a re markably handsome man), never expect my blessing, but my curse shall surely light upon you."</span>Poor Mrs. Grove used to say,<span class="q"> "I felt horror at the thoughts of my mother's curse."</span></p><p>It was mentioned above, that a desperate ague obliged Mrs. Berkeley to resign the task of nursing her son to ano ther.

Mrs. Berke ley in that, as in other things, resembles her Father. — When young, her Mother used to tell the Editor, that she thought she <span class="hi">could</span> not be <span class="hi">her</span> child, because she used to wish to leave a ball-room at four o'clock — her Mother telling her often that she used to stay till <span class="hi">eight,</span> then drive home several miles, exchange her ball-dress for her morning one, and not go to rest till twelve next night, or rather morning; for her mother, Mrs. Cherry, never retired to her chamber till twelve, and constantly rose, winter and summer, at six, until within two years of her death, at sixty-eight, when she rose not until seven o'clock. It was little likely that Mrs. Berkeley should enjoy much sleep after so interesting a conversation of four hours.</p><p>Mrs. Berkeley is said, by all those who have known her most intimately from her childhood, to be of the most hopeful temper they ever knew: she preserves with tenderest care a hair ring given by her dear Son; an elegant figure of Hope leaning on her anchor, one hand pointing up to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e365377">[Page ccxci]</span> heaven, with this motto in hair,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">Heaven's best gift to man.</span>"</span>It is very certain, that until she saw her Son the day after his happy spirit had quitted his fine form she did flatter herself, that the mercy of God would spare him to her; under the idea of having laboured from her youth to obey, oblige, delight her own excellent Mother, in order to make her feel less poignantly the loss of an al most adoring husband, that God would vouchsafe to reward her in KIND, and spare her Son. But, alas! her Son was her idol; and idols must be given up. The Editor was supposed to be idolized by <span class="hi">her</span> Mother, of whom it used to be said,<span class="q"> "Mrs. Frinsham loves her so much, that she never lets her walk across the room without looking at her (little insignificant figure) with pleasure in her eyes."</span>That delight must have arisen from thinking she bore some resemblance to her excellent Father. The Editor has the pleasure to reflect that there was nothing she would not have sacrificed to please the best of Mothers, and that she always prayed to God that he would be pleased to spare her life, if it were only for <span class="hi">one week</span> beyond her Mother's, that she might be spared the affliction of seeing her go before her. The Editor felt that she was the cause of much sad anxiety to her Mother, not having had the small pox, as her excellent sister had when a child, at Mrs. Sheeles's school, and its being la mentably fatal in Mrs. Frinsham's family, her eldest sister being one Saturday esteemed the most beautiful creature in<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e366623">[Page ccxcii]</span> London<span id="o5280-n00560_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="The beaux of that day bestowed the following subriques on the three co heiresses of Mr. Cherry, all beauties.

The eldest above mentioned, the Duke Cherry, fit for a Duke; the second, the fine Black Cherry, from her dark hair, her complexion lovely; the third, Mrs. Frinsham, the finest figure of the three, was termed the Heart Cherry. She proved her right to that pleasing subrique, by rejecting, for the sake of the Editor's father with a small fortune, but un common worth, numbers of brilliant splendid matches. Her ideas on that head descended to her daughter and her grandson. It is a little remarkable that there was a very strong resemblance in the faces of Dr. Berkeley and Mrs. Frin sham, so as to strike Dr. Berkeley himself the first time he saw her pictures. Neither of her daughters resembled her in the smallest degree, either in her ex quisitely fine tall figure, which used to occasion her being followed in the Park, Mall, &amp;c. where young ladies exhibited in those days, and which she retained to the last, as well as her fine red and white, and the exquisite sweetness of coun tenance, the distinguishing temper of her soul, as well as of the Editor's angelic delightful friend, the late Mrs. Catharine Talbot, of Lambeth Palace. These two lovely ladies 'pictures hung near each other in Dr. Berkeley's eating-room. It is probable such kindred spirits are united in the realms of bliss.</span>, and the next the most deplorable object, mor tified all over, and much blacker than an Ethiop. In the latter part the Editor has no doubt but she had resembled her lovely Aunt, had she not been inoculated by Mr. Sutton himself, who attended her at her own house at Acton, with great assiduity, Dr. Berkeley being then rector of that parish. They were sensible of the blessing of such a Preacher. Multitudes came every Sunday to Acton church, to hear one who, according to St. Paul, did not, as, he observed to the Editor in his last illness,<span class="q"> "preach himself, BUT CHRIST JESUS THE LORD;"</span>adding,<span class="q"> "HE knows I<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e368233">[Page ccxciii]</span> preached him in SINCERITY, always dreading to be a popular preacher, a pleaser of the people."</span></p><p>The following observations are intended solely to benefit some few unfortunate families where the small pox is worse than the plague. Mrs. Berkeley having not long weaned her second son, and duly prepared by Mr. Sutton, her friends all conceived that inoculation would be to her what, by the blessing of God, it is to thousands, to mil lions, not to herself; <span class="hi">she</span> conceived, if she escaped with life, that would be all; but the sufferings, her not having had that frightful disease <span class="hi">had</span> occasioned to her Mother, <span class="hi">did</span> constantly occasion to an almost adoring Husband, and the tenderest of Sisters, determined her one way or other to deliver them from their incessant anxiety; accordingly she, together with Mr. Monck Berkeley, then between four and five years old, were both inoculated on the same day, with the same matter. The latter had only three pustules, and did not lose half an hour's play through indisposition. His Mother had but few in her face, those on her nose pitted to the bone, a vast number on her head, a fright ful quantity in her throat, and several on her arms, fingers, and feet; all shewed their malignity by being confluent, and not turning until three and twenty days — a plain proof, but for Mr. Sutton's method of treating the small pox, she had shared the fate of her beautiful aunt Miss Cherry. Mr. Sutton asserted to Dr. Berkeley and others,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e369389">[Page ccxiv]</span> Mrs. Berkeley's friends, that he had never before had such a patient. He was much alarmed, and exceedingly atten tive, saying,<span class="q"> "that had Mrs. Berkeley caught the small pox in the natural way, she would have mortified in a few days; that had Mr. Monck Berkeley caught it in the natural way, it had probably never have been known that he had had it."</span>Mrs. Berkeley's mother, Mrs. Frinsham, had only ten pustules, when a child about eight years old. A singular symptom attended Mrs. Berkeley's small pox, that of her eyes being, for more than three days, set in their sockets, so fixed that she could not move them at all, could only see in an absolutely straight direction; yet she had not one pustule in her eyes, or on her eye-lids; it was quite internal.</p><p>Mrs. Berkeley had been at first at Sutton House; but, having always a wonderful partiality for her own home, which she conceives would be the case if her home was a neat clean barn, begged Mr. Sutton's permission to return to her own house, with which he very obligingly complied, on condition of her going to him when he could not call on her, which she punctually did, her horses having no thing else to do, but drag her then wretched frame to take the air, as directed, half a dozen times in the day, she be ing unable to walk. Mrs. Berkeley, in her visits to Sutton House, used to enquire of the sensible well-bred Reverend Mr. Houlton, chaplain to Mr. Sutton, when her eyes would<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e370580">[Page ccxcv]</span> be better? his constant answer was,<span class="q"> "Oh! dear Madam, you will be in heaven to morrow, I assure you."</span>The next day Mrs. Berkeley, on entering the drawing-room, enquired of her fellow patients where Mr. Houlton was, that she might tell him,<span class="q"> "She did not like HIS, Mr. HOULTON's, heaven at all."</span>The very witty Canon Bowles, of Salis bury, being one of the patients, opened the door, and called out,<span class="q"> "Houlton, come down; her is Mrs. Berkeley, the lady of a Divine, that declares she does not even <span class="hi">wish</span> to go to heaven; — come down, man, and talk to the poor lady."</span></p><p>A lady, whose name is not at present remembered by the Editor, came down one morning, looking much dis tressed, saying,<span class="q"> "I am very ill indeed."</span>She sent for the sensible, clever, <span class="hi">consoling</span> housekeeper, and exhibited her chest covered over with a most tremendous erysipelas. The housekeeper said,<span class="q"> "Do not fear, Madam; if it please God, you will get safe through;"</span>the lady, turning to Mrs. Berkeley, said,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">If I do,</span> I shall be the <span class="hi">first</span> of my family that ever did."</span>It did please Providence to bring her safely through, and spare her to a most anxious husband, who visited her with trembling tenderness per petually.</p><p>Mrs. Berkeley suffered much from the kind persecutions of Dr. Berkeley and her Sister, to suffer Sir William Duncan<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e371667">[Page ccxcvi]</span> and Dr. Addington<span id="o5280-n00565_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="Dr. Addington used frequently to tell the Editor, that the first fee he ever received was at the house of Mr. Frinsham.

His wonderfully low-lived parents gave rings of his hair, set with diamonds, to many of the ladies of Can terbury, who would not have known that he existed, as himself used to say, but for Mrs. Berkeley's gratitude; which when he, at nineteen, quitted the King's School, led her to invite him to play at cards at the round table with the younger ladies and gentlemen at her routs. Mrs. Berkeley<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e383122">[Page cccv]</span> introduced him to her learned friend the Reverend John Duncombe and his Lady, and requested them, when she left Canterbury, in 1777, to take to him. His mind re ceived much cultivation from that learned, worthy, well-in formed pair. To Mrs. Berkeley the old woman sent into <span class="hi">Berkshire,</span> Mrs. Berkeley being there at the time of his death, a piece of catgut worked with her son's hair, saying,<span class="q"> "that Mrs. Berkeley did not <span class="hi">want</span> diamonds."</span>Poor young man, he often, when living, felt her low absurdi ties, when she <span class="hi">insisted</span> on exhibiting to her son's company. He repeatedly said to numbers of people,<span class="q"> "But for Mrs. Berkeley's goodness, and I had been in such a set,"</span>(naming several aldermen's sons, &amp;c.) some now vio lent Democrats, who were kept in their own line of company, whilst Jackson was in the first company in the church and county. His father, at his death, left legacies to all his son's friends, excepting to Mrs. Duncombe and to Mrs. Berkeley, to neither of whom an hundred guineas for a ring would have been unacceptable. But the new Legacy Bill will never affect Mrs. Berkeley; for, as Mrs. Frinsham says, when any of her rich relations die childless,<span class="q"> "Sister, to be sure they forget that you and I exist, or that we know how to <span class="hi">spend</span> a little money, for none of them ever name us even for a ten guinea ring."</span></p><p>But, quitting this subject for a much pleasanter, Jackson immediately presented himself in Mrs. Berkeley's dressing room,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e384297">[Page cccvi]</span> when she introduced him to Mr. Manby, requesting him to become his guide, to conduct him to every thing worthy notice in the church or city, to repair to the Oaks every morning at breakfast, and every day at three to take their dinner with Mrs. Berkeley, and spend the afternoon; the Prebendaries dining together at each other's houses, during the audit, the tables generally being full; and taking their tea in the audit-room.</p><p>On the day when they dined at Dr. Berkeley's, on Mrs. Berkeley's entering the eating-room, the dinner served, the Bishop of Norwich, then Dean, going up to her, presented her with a pamphlet, saying,<span class="q"> "Madam, entirely in obedience to your commands, there is the sermon that I preached on Trinity Sunday. If it pro duces any good, it is entirely owing to you, for it has been often preached, and never was intended for the press. but you insisted upon its being published; and I have obeyed your orders."</span>Many of the Prebendaries said, the public were very much indebted to Mrs. Berkeley. The Bishop, when sitting at dinner, said,<span class="q"> "I must request you, my dear Madam, to give me a list of your friends whom you wish should read it, that I may send it to my bookseller."</span>Mrs. Berkeley felt, as it merited, this very polite attention from her most excellent old friend, and said,<span class="q"> "She would request a few to send to some of her friends in Scotland; that her English friends could pro vide<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e385446">[Page cccvii]</span> themselves:"</span>then said,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">I must pull this incompara ble discourse all to pieces;</span> and get some of my pocket M.

A lady, who was a stranger, visiting at Mrs. Berkeley's, happened to sit opposite the fine portrait of Mr. Berkeley, painted by his amiable accomplished friend, Mr. Peters; she, in a low voice, said to the lady who sat next to her,<span class="q"> "I never saw so like a picture in my life."</span>Mrs. Berkeley, although she cannot see, yet hears remarkably quick, (thanks to God's blessing on the skill of Mr. Maull in Piccadilly, ex erted about twenty years ago,) said,<span class="q"> "I did not know, Ma dam, that my Son had the honour to be known to you."</span>To which the good old lady very politely replied,<span class="q"> "Ma dam, <span class="hi">I</span> had the honour to be known to Mr. Berkeley. One year returning from Margate, we wished to see the cathe dral of Canterbury; we walked up, and could not see any one to tell us where to find the person who showed it. We saw a great many gentlemen walking backwards and forwards by the side of the church. After some time one<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e388107">[Page cccix]</span> of them, detaching himself from the rest, came up to us, and, in the politest manner, said, 'Ladies, are you in any distress, in which I can assist you? The ladies told their wish to see the cathedral, and their utter inability to find out how to do it. Mr. Berkeley said,' If you will have the goodness to wait two minutes, I will get the verger to attend you. ' He stepped into a shop, sent off a lad for the verger, and again joined the ladies. On the ar rival of the verger, Mr. Berkeley escorted them into the church, pointed out to them some particular beauties of that glorious temple of God, charged the verger not to omit shewing them some things as he named; then, saying' he had an engagement, 'made an elegant bow, wished them a pleasant journey, and took his leave."</span>The ladies enquired of the verger who that young gentleman was to whose politeness they were so much indebted. He replied,<span class="q"> "that it was Mr. Berkeley, son to one of the Pre bends."</span>The ladies expressing gratitude, the verger said,<span class="q"> "Yes, Madam, every body loves Mr. Berkeley exceedingly, he is so kind and condescending to every one."</span></p><p>Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley both had been for some time wishing to obtain for their worthy old servant, Mr. Wright son, when he should marry and quit service, the place of one of his Majesty's messengers, he having repeatedly flown, with incredible velocity, over this kingdom, and to and from Ireland, on Dr. Berkeley's business; and probably,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e389313">[Page cccx]</span> had it not pleased the ALL-WISE Director of ALL things, <span class="hi">small</span> as well as <span class="hi">great,</span> to remove to the society he so strongly resembled on earth the angelic Mr. Manby, the poor of Canterbury had not been blessed with quite so excellent, so judicious, and so kind a governor, as successor to their former very worthy master, Mr. Nott. It is surely a de light to every feeling heart, to see the aged poor made happy, the young instructed and brought up industriously, the way to be happy here and hereafter.</p><p>The Editor is much addicted, wherever she resides or stays, any little time at a place, to visit the <span class="hi">work-houses,</span> feeling tender pity for those who have not a penny to buy tobacco, snuff, or a little <span class="hi">two</span> shilling tea, and <span class="hi">sweetened sand,</span> called sugar, to season it. Her feelings suffered much whilst at Oxford; as she really conceives, from what she <span class="hi">herself</span> saw. The relation of two of her old servants, whom she frequently sent thither, that most well-regulated Bride wells are Paradises compared to the Oxford Work-house; in short, nothing out of the infernal regions can be worse, or worse conducted. Mrs. Berkeley's maid, sent thither one day to see after a poor sick woman, was obliged to take shelter in a room some poor creature opened to her; an audacious harlot flying through the house with a great knife to murder the then poor, stupid, ignorant mistress. They have no poundage from earnings: <span class="hi">once</span> in the year, at the <span class="hi">Races,</span> they have, some two-pence, some six-pence,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e390499">[Page cccxi]</span> given them, as one of the guardians told Mrs. <span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>, to <span class="hi">figure away</span> with on the Course.</p><p>Mrs. Berkeley, one day, on going out, gave a poor woman, who had called the mistress to her, and shewn her the <span class="hi">uncultivated</span> wretched garden, a shilling. The poor wo man's gratitude and extacies were sorely distressing, adding,<span class="q"> "I have not seen a shilling before for two years."</span>This poor creature had lived comfortably in London, her hus band a mason, killed by the breaking of a scaffold, when alas! she was wretched enough to belong to some parish in Oxford. Mrs. Berkeley enquired whom among the guar dians were tenderly disposed towards the poor, and was told, Mr. Slatter the baker, and Mr. Ayton the grocer. Mr. Slatter serving Dr. Berkeley's family with bread, she instantly set off to call on him, and never recollects to have seen a more sensible, well-behaved, humane person in humble station; he would make a better figure in an higher, than many who have scrambled up to it. He assured her, that, unable to combat with the <span class="hi">majority</span> of the guardians in defence of the poor, he had in despair relinquished it entirely.</p><p>She then went to Mr. Ayton, and received a similar an swer. She exhorted both, but, she fears, in vain. How ever unpleasant it might be to continue to fight the battles of the poor, she assured them there would come a time<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e391598">[Page cccxii]</span> when they would rejoice that they had done it. Their an swer was, that the lowest and most mercenary of the trades men were appointed guardians, and there was no opposing them. How different from Canterbury! two most re spectable tradesmen out of each of the sixteen parishes are annually chosen; sometimes, she conceives, rechosen; as, when she wished to get a poor creature going in com fortably deposited, she constantly went to Dr. Berkeley's baker, the very worthy, sensible well-bred Mr. Johnson, educated at the university of Cambridge. On the death of his father he most dutifully and affectionately went home, to assist his worthy mother in carrying on her business. Mr. Johnson, if not in office himself, constantly took care to apply to some worthy man who was. The Editor is no Democrat; feels horrors at the vile idea of Equality — but such direful <span class="hi">inequality</span> as a rich <span class="hi">bon-vivant</span> Oxford tradesman — and the poor, almost poisoned poor creatures in that vile workhouse, must hurt every heart who has ever redde in the Bible,<span class="q"> "Who maketh thee to differ from an other?"</span>&amp;c.</p><p>The Editor, after delivering her sentiments very freely on one class of people in Oxford, cannot quit the place without taking notice of a very different class, whom she once had it in contemplation to address in the Oxford Mercury, as she did not feel happy to quit Oxford without offering her very grateful acknowledgements to them — the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e392694">[Page cccxiii]</span> young gentlemen of the University. It is a general, an al most universal complaint amongst the Fair Sex. The Edi tor begs pardon for a misnomer; she ought to have written the RED SEX; for almost all now resemble <span class="hi">Rouge Dragon</span> in Heraldry; to be sure, the present dress makes them re sembles Heraldic animals, and Swift's yahoos. The Edi tor, famous amongst her friends for never wearing any cap or hat that did not become her sort of face, nor any colour that did not become her complexion, and was perpetually consulted on that subject by her friends, cannot help think ing, that the Father of Mischief has been the inventor of the present mode of dressing, particularly the vile, scooped out hats, or rather straw caps; she therefore styles them <span class="hi">Diabolls. </span>It is no wonder that husbands go astray from wives so odiously disfigured.</p><p>That all polite attentions from gentlemen to ladies is at an end, is a charge perhaps too well founded. An excel lent exaltedly pious friend of the Editor's, but lately gone to glory, the lady of the late very worthy amiable Thomas Baber, Esquire, of Sunninghill Park, and who had the hap piness to be the mother of Edward Baber, Esquire, well known to all in the East for his <span class="hi">inflexible</span> honesty. He had the happiness of throughly pious, as well as accomplished parents. This lady, once a most celebrated beauty, used to say,<span class="q"> "The young men of this day are quite Hottentots; all I expect of them is, that, if I happen to fall down,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e393883">[Page cccxiv]</span> they will be so good as to kick me aside, and not walk over me."</span>The Editor fears the charge may be too true; but she feels it a duty incumbent on her to say,<span class="q"> "that if politeness to females is banished from every other place, it has taken up its residence amongst the <span class="hi">young</span> gentle men of the university of Oxford — <span class="hi">true</span> politeness extending ever to <span class="hi">aged</span> females."</span></p><p>The Editor, as has been mentioned before, has at sixty every accomplishment that some are without at eighty; frequently, if walking alone, stepping into a <span class="hi">grey</span> puddle, mistaking it for a nice clean broad stone. The polite at tentions from young gentlemen in assisting her to cross the street, sometimes accompanying her half a street's length to direct her to a shop, opening the door for her, always giving her the wall, not driving her off the pave ment, as two officers did a few years ago at Newcastle, she leaning on her husband's arm — he being dressed in a short cassock, they supposed him a bishop, as they said <span class="hi">en passant,</span> and knew <span class="hi">(worthy wights!)</span> he could not <span class="hi">challenge</span> them, but he severely reproved their <span class="hi">brutality. </span>The Editor happened to hear that the wife of one of them <span class="hi">amply</span> re venged her quarrel. He almost deserved it.</p><p>The Editor certainly owes her life to the polite humanity of one gentleman, whose name, although she took much pains to learn it, she never could find out, until the even ing<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e395018">[Page cccxv]</span> before she quitted Magdalene Lodge, at the close of November 1795, or every grateful, respectful attention would have been rendered to the Reverend Mr. Williams, Sub-warden of Wadham College.</p><p>A Lady of fashion, well known in the polite circles, now of an age, as well as the Editor, to dress for <span class="hi">comfort,</span> not for shew, having an house in the neigbourhood of Oxford, often walking in the street with the Editor, said,<span class="q"> "Your remark is very just, that the young men here are <span class="hi">certainly very well-bred;</span> if they were not, they would laugh at us — for, to be sure, you with your black beaver gypsey hat, tied down and hiding half your little (politeness prevented her adding, withered) face, and your rusty black cloak; and <span class="hi">I</span> in my <span class="hi">old</span> hat and <span class="hi">old</span> great coat, are two curious enough figures."</span>The Editor's excellent relation and herself are both old-fashioned, in making it a point to pay their butcher and baker every Monday morning. And the Editor used always to tell Dr. Berkeley, and her Son, when she got a lecture for walking out in a morning without a servant, that she did not like a footman attending her, when she did not appear as if she could pay him his wages.</p><p>The Editor never met with any impertinence, but twice, during her <span class="hi">sejour</span> in Oxford. — One day walking by Baliol College, a poor creature in <span class="hi">(she supposes)</span> a servitor's gown,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e396117">[Page cccxvi]</span> expressing his dislike of her hat, and after she was passed, said,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">he would give a crown to know who she was,</span>"</span>the Editor languished to have turned on her heel, and have said,<span class="q"> "Young man, save your crown to buy Trusler's edition of 'Lord Chesterfield's Advice to the amiable Phil. Stanhope. ' — I will tell you, without reward, that I am the wife of Dr. Berkeley, Prebendary of Canterbury;"</span>but, having with her a lady who always returns pertness by <span class="hi">silent disdain</span> (which affects not fools, it may wise persons) the Editor's <span class="hi">generosity</span> in gratifying the poor low-lived crea tures curiosity <span class="hi">gratis</span> would have hurt her dignity. The other was, one very hot evening, the Editor had taken in her hand a <span class="hi">para-sol;</span> a shower coming on, she held it over her head, to protect a very good hat. Not far from Christ church she met a number of gentlemen, pushing home from the shower, who all passed her with their usual politeness, stepping off the very narrow pavement, to avoid incom moding her; the rear was brought up by a <span class="hi">little</span> insignificant looking animal in a gown, who in a voice, resembling any thing but that of a young man, squeaked out,<span class="q"> "Look, look, here is a lady holding a <span class="hi">para-sol</span> over her in this violent shower — what a fool she must be!!!"</span>The Editor heard two or three of the gentlemen say,<span class="q"> "Not at all — it did not rain (she supposes they added) when she set out."</span>The name of this wise <span class="hi">little miss,</span> in a black gown, is concealed in pity to his <span class="hi">poor</span> parents — it is enough to be <span class="hi">burthened</span> with <span class="hi">such</span> a poor little<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e397422">[Page cccxvii]</span> creature, without seeing him held up to public con tempt.</p><p>A very worthy friend of the Editor's, whom she has not had the <span class="hi">delight</span> of seeing for many years, Mrs. M.

They resemble, in some respects, holy Job, who says,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">Eyes was I to the blind, feet was I to the lame,</span>"</span>&amp;c. The Editor sincerely hopes, that they may never be afflicted as he was; and that those of her polite assisters, who choose to marry, may meet with wiser and more pious wives than<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e398479">[Page cccxviii]</span> <span class="hi">at first</span> fell to the lot of, certainly a <span class="hi">favourite</span> of the ALMIGHTY's; HE naming him one of the three with Noah and Daniel, who should deliver their own souls.

The Editor wishes she could get her income from Ire land, as easily as her Books (which, alas! have been so ill kept, that they have not defrayed the expence of carriage and duty. But, that many of them being wanted to complete sets in England, it had been wiser to have permitted the Irish worms to have finished them in their native country); the Custom-house Officers would not seize that.

That it is not yet accomplished, nor probably ever will, was not to be attri buted to want of every exertion of the amiable Dr. Ser grove, master of Pembroke College. This produced a de gree of intimacy. Mrs. Berkeley, ever wishing, with little ability, to benefit all her friends children, took the liberty to recommend to his attention and protection, a very sen sible, fine youth of his College, a son of the very worthy Mr. Andrews, surgeon at Stanmore in Middlesex, one of fourteen olive-branches to whom this throughly amia ble hearted, benevolent man was exceedingly attentive and kind, and told the Editor,<span class="q"> "that it had pleased him, and he dared say would please her, that young Andrews had, on Dr. Johnson's rooms becoming vacant, earnestly so licited to have them assigned to him."</span>Young Andrews and his whole family, have as strong understandings as Dr. Johnson. They are famed for it. May he make as good use of it as did his predecessor in the rooms! This agreable friend visited at Magdalene Lodge three days be fore he went to town — to return, alas! no more — request ing Mrs. Berkeley and Mrs. Frinsham earnestly to honour<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e401354">[Page cccxx]</span> him, as he politely termed it, by drinking tea, and spend ing the evening at the Master's lodgings, saying, he would invite some ladies, whom he named, the rector of Lincoln, and some other sensible, agreable friends to meet them. The very tender state of Mrs. Berkeley's health forced her to decline it, which she now regrets. He promised to visit Datchet; alas! may his obliged friend meet him in a <span class="hi">still</span> pleasanter place.</p><p>Mrs. Berkeley, on her revisiting Oxford for a few days, offered for the Reverend Mr. Williams's acceptance, and which she hopes he received, one of the copies on royal paper, gilt, &amp;c.

About the year 1785, the shop of a very respectable woollen-draper and master-tailor was broke open, and robbed of goods and money to a large amount. Every one was at a loss to guess who had done the deed, excepting the worthy sufferer. A gentleman of large for tune, of strict integrity, on whom the Editor bestowed the title of RHADAMANTHUS, as apt to say unpleasant things, as his sweetly amiable son is to utter pleasing ones, thought proper to say,<span class="q"> "Mr. <span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>(the name not recollected by the Editor) <span class="hi">had robbed himself.</span> "</span>This naturally rouzed the honest man, who said,<span class="q"> "he <span class="hi">must now</span> find out the burg larian at any rate."</span>He immediately procured a war rant to apprehend his journeyman, who had served a seven years 'apprenticeship to him, and behaved himself in the most exemplary manner. He immediately accused his accomplice, a journeyman hair-dresser. They were both examined by the Mayor, and committed to prison. Mr. Berkeley coming home, the Editor at dinner asked him<span class="q"> "if he knew this young Jew who had committed the robbery;"</span>to which he replied,<span class="q"> "Poor creature, he had never committed this, nor probably any other robbery, if he had not been drawn in by a vile rascal of a Chris tian, as he is by courtesy styled, a villain. It was<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e410317">[Page cccxxviii]</span> moving to hear how excellent a character his worthy master gave of him, until, he said, within these last few months, that he became acquainted with this <span class="hi">Christian</span> rascal, when he became idle, and, of course, vicious."</span>No human being, surely, ever had a greater dread of idle ness than Mr. Monck Berkeley; and often, during the lat ter part of his illness, used to exclaim,<span class="q"> "What an idle life I lead! Surely God will, I fear, call me into judgement for it. I do nothing; I write nothing."</span></p><p>Mr. Berkeley lamented, that, through the stupidity of the <span class="hi">then</span> town clerk, the poor creature had not been admitted to bail. After dinner he retired to his own apartment, and consulted his law books. He was to leave Canterbury very early the next morning, in company with his very amiable neighbour, William Deedes, Junior, Esquire, of St. Stephen's, Canterbury, both being obliged to keep term that day at the Temple — Mr. Deedes, that he might not idle away a large estate, which he now possesses and spends most worthily; Mr. Berkeley, that he might get one, as he probably would have done, had it pleased God to have blessed him with health.</p><p>About eleven o'clock at night Mr. Berkeley came home, and thus accosted his Mother:<span class="q"> "My dear Madam, you must be pleased to <span class="hi">promise me,</span> that you will go to-mor row morning, the minute you have breakfasted, <span class="hi">before</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e411427">[Page cccxxix]</span> <span class="hi">you go to church,</span> to this poor creature's parents, and tell them, that if they do not retain Garrow to plead for their son, he will certainly be sentenced to death — that Gar row can and will get him off.

Don't let them <span class="hi">hackle</span> with him; for he will not come for a less fee, and I know he will come for that; and <span class="hi">I</span> repeat it, and I de sire you to say, that <span class="hi">nothing else can</span> save their son — poor fellow!"</span></p><p>Mrs. B. —<span class="q"> "I know not even where they live."</span></p><p>Mr. B. —<span class="q"> "Oh!

In the morning, a little before five, the hour the chaise was ordered, Mr. Berkeley crept into the chamber like a zephyr, that he might not disturb his<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e412532">[Page cccxxx]</span> Father, a very bad sleeper, and repeated in his Mother's ear all she was to say. The promise once obtained, he had no uneasiness on that score. The Editor, after breakfast, set off for Best's Lane, where she witnessed <span class="hi">such</span> a scene, as (her dear compassionate Son being removed) she trusts, and thinks, no one can <span class="hi">ever again</span> compel her to witness.</p><p>On entering the house, she saw affliction personified in the figure of a decent middle-aged woman. Mrs. Berke ley, conceiving her the mother of the unfortunate young man, began condoling with her. Soon coming to the point, telling her who she was, and delivering her Son's message, the poor woman exclaimed,<span class="q"> "My God, what goodness! that <span class="hi">such</span> a gentleman should condescend to think about such a <span class="hi">poor wretch</span> as I am. Oh! may God reward him!!! Well! to be sure, somebody <span class="hi">did</span> tell me that a fine young gentleman, one of the Prebendary's Sons, did say, walking on the Parade with other gentle men, that my <span class="hi">poor boy need not</span> have been committed to gaol."</span>She instantly rose, and called her husband. On his entering the room, she repeated Mr. Berkeley's message with delight — when, horrid to relate, — what can one call him? not a descendant of Abraham by Sarah, not a <span class="hi">Sara cen,</span> as the descendants of Esau style themselves, that they be not mistaken for the descendants of Abraham by Hagar. he must have been an <span class="hi">Ishmaelite,</span> worse than an Ishmaelite; for not only his hand, but his HORRID tongue, was against<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e413726">[Page cccxxxi]</span> his <span class="hi">own</span> child; for, in an hoarse surly voice, he said,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">No, no; I shall do not such thing; let him take his chance; if he can't get off, he must be hanged.</span>"</span>Mrs. Berkeley, on seeing the agonies of the poor distracted mother, longed to have said to him,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">You will be damned.</span>"</span>She did, however, re strain her indignation a little, and joined the supplications of the wretched Mother, elevated with Mr. Berkeley's message into confidence of her poor son's life, now thrown into the deepest despair. Never did the Editor so much wish for a large fortune as at that moment, to have given the mother the fee for the counsel that Mr. Monck Berkeley so earnestly recommended. After finding all soothing utterly in vain, she gave a loose to her indignation, saying every thing that it suggested to her. At length, bidding farewel to this wretched mourning mother, she returned home, without deigning to look at the old father. Much it may be sup posed <span class="hi">he</span> felt this. Not so his kind adviser, Mr. Monck Berkeley. One of the Editor's <span class="hi">minor</span> punishments for her children, when young, until ten or twelve years old, was,<span class="q"> "You have not behaved well, in so, or so; I will not look at you until to-morrow dinner time."</span>This was so keenly felt by her eldest Son, Mr. Monck Berkeley, that he would often, in the sweetest voice, supplicate,<span class="q"> "Now do forget it, and look at me a little."</span>A proof this, of what the Editor frequently asserts,<span class="q"> "That a little common sense, and great steadiness, may rescue children from <span class="hi">much</span> cor poral<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e414994">[Page cccxxxii]</span> punishment, and make a more lasting impression on their minds."</span></p><p>Compassion carried her, sometimes, when taking her morning walk, to visit this<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">House of moarning.</span>"</span>This melancholy affair happened several weeks before the assizes. The wretch remained inflexible, and the poor mother in such a state of despair, as never to wash her hands or face, put on or take off her cloaths, sitting the whole day without uttering a word. At length, just before the trial was to come on, some more powerful orator than Mrs. Berkeley; probably some modern TERTULLUS, prevailed on the old wretch to send and retain Mr. Garrow, who came on from Maidstone to Canterbury; and, as Mr. Berkeley had fore told, got the poor young Jew off for transportation for life. Some kind Christian neighbour (for she and her children were esteemed by all, as the poor soul justly said, for more than twenty years past) flew out of the Guildhall, and told her the<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">joyful tidings.</span>"</span>— She started up, fell on her knees, thanked God, went up stairs, dressed herself neatly as formerly, went out to the fish-market, and ordered hom her matters for her family as usual.</p><p>Dr. Berkeley, on hearing it, as all the city was talking of it, expressed his astonishment, that the mind could so soon, after such length of time, recover its wanted energy. The Editor, it may be supposed, did not fail to call in Bests<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e416095">[Page cccxxxiii]</span> Lane, and obey the delightfully pleasing injunction of the Apostle —<span class="q"> "Rejoice with them that do rejoice."</span>The worthy woman's gratitude, ascribing the <span class="hi">temporal</span> salvation of her son to Mr. Monck Berkeley's judicious, amiably kind advice, in which all agreed, was very delightful to the fond heart of his happy mother.</p><p>It is impossible to omit mentioning here, that, in the year 1793, Dr. Berkeley had with him, at Canterbury, Mr. Patrick Satterley, eldest son of the skilful, successful, humane Mr. Satterley, surgeon and apothecary, of Hastings, for whom Dr. Berkeley had taken a lodging, accidentally, at a silversmith's in Palace Street, whose worthy wife was sister to the young man rescued from the gallows by Mr. Berkeley. Mr. Satterley getting a violent fever, and Dr. Berkeley going to him, they discovered that he was the father of their brother's benefactor, and immediately declared that no nurse was necessary, for that they esteemed it their duty to render every possibly attention to any friend of that dear good Mr. Berkeley, who had been the means of rescuing their poor brother from an ignominious death.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley, on going to Hastings, was told by his surgeon in town, Mr. Blicke, that he would find a most skilful, attentive, medical man in Mr. Satterley.

The night before he was to commence his journey to London, he stayed with him till eleven o'clock (a late hour in the those wiser times), telling him, that, setting aside the <span class="hi">indignity</span> of the business, it would be the destruction of his <span class="hi">antient</span> family and <span class="hi">large</span> estate: at length, the excellent pastor, unable to prevail on his <span class="hi">steady</span> patron, took his leave. Early the next morning Mr. Gurdon set out for London; a long narrow lane lay between his house and the high road — on a sudden the coach stopped, with a violent jerk, in the narrowest part of the lane. The coachman called out to the postillion, to know why he dared to stop so suddenly. He replied,<span class="q"> "The horses won't go on."</span>—<span class="q"> "Whip them then."</span>—<span class="q"> "I can't, for Dr. <span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>(name forgotten by the Editor) lies across the road, all in the mud.

On the King's return, Mr. Gurdon was attained, as one of the King's Judges; his name is in the list, the Editor thinks, in Nalson's "Life of Charles the First;" but it was happily proved that Mr. Gurdon <span class="hi">did not attend. </span></span></span> of Assenwick Hall, in Suffolk, both gentlemen of<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e426448">[Page cccxl]</span> fortune; but the idea of detaining a Curate's salary, how ever rich he might be, always hurt him.

Walking out one evening, she called at a farm-house, to enquire for some pigeons. The mistress presented her self. Mrs. Berkeley, wishing to shorten her walk home requested the good woman to direct her the nearer way in crossing the fields. Mrs. Berkeley, not to appear proud, began enquiring what family she had?

As also, that he spent the whole of the summer at Dr. Berke ley's, his curate constantly going to Mr. Hamilton's house in Warwickshire, in May, and remaining there until November, in order that Mr. Hamilton might, as Dr. Berkeley used to say,<span class="q"> "give <span class="hi">him</span> all the time he could spare from his <span class="hi">friends,</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e431530">[Page cccxlv]</span> the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the river."</span>Mr. Hamilton, although an excellent scholar, was wonderfully fond of hunting, shooting, and fishing. Dr. Berkeley, living on the banks of the Thames, had al ways a large pleasure-boat of his own, in which Mr. Hamil ton, an excellent sailor and rower, was perpetually on the water, alone, early in the morning, but frequently took Mr. Monck Berkeley with him. Mrs. Berkeley, dreading his too volatile agility, feared that, in <span class="hi">attempting</span> to ASSIST Mr. Hamilton in sailing or rowing, he might be drowned; notwithstanding her strong opinion, still retained by the Editor, although often laughed at by Mr. Hamilton, that infants, if put into the water, would swim naturally, as well as puppies, kittens, calves, &amp;c. He often urged her to <span class="hi">try the experiment</span> on her own little boy. Mrs. Berkeley told him she was not an <span class="hi">experimental</span> philosopher, and was terribly afraid he might be drowned, with his garments, <span class="hi">not</span> provided by nature like kittens, &amp;c<span id="o5280-n00635_return"><a class="notelink collapsed" title="During Mr. Berkeley's stay at the King's school, nothing could prevail upon him to swim out of his depth; to the great discontent of his mother.

One day, after having been some time at Eton, a young gentleman from Eton came over to see him; and, happening to relate something, said to Mrs. Berkeley,<span class="q"> "You know he swims as well as you do."</span>— To which the Editor re plied,<span class="q"> "That is not at all I suppose."</span>— <span class="q">O yes, Madam, Berkeley is, I really think, the best swimmer in the school.

I, horridly frighted, instantly swam after them, and have swum, as he says, 'like a duck,' ever since. I am sure I was much obliged by them;</span>adding,<span class="q"> "Eton for ever, say I!"</span>The Editor had frequently, before her Son was born, heard Lady<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>relate this prac tice of the Etonians to a new comer; and it actually occasioned her worrying her Lord out of his <span class="hi">determination</span> of sending his son to Eton. Folly, thy name is <span class="hi">Woman. </span>Accordingly <span class="hi">Lordy,</span> as they style the Peers 'eldest son in Scotland, had NOTHING of Eton about him when he came out into life. The Editor's kindred had always been Etonians and Oxonians. She does not remember to have heard that any of them turned out foolish <span class="hi">vaut-riens. </span>Mr. Berkeley, like most Eton men, was a very excellent rower, as was most happily experienced by a party of ladies and gentlemen in his father's boat. Dr. Berkeley, &amp;c. had gone up the river, to dine at Medenham Abbey — soon after they had entered the boat to return, a most dreadful storm of thunder, lightning, and rain came on. Some of the ladies were much terrified; which Mr. Berkeley perceiving, said to Mr. Wrightson,<span class="q"> "Come, John, give me your oar;"</span>and the Editor fears to set down in how short a time Mr. Berkeley, and his father's gardener, formerly a most excellent waterman, now an helpless aged almshouse-man at Maiden head, rowed eleven miles — the boat seemed to fly. But Mr. Berkeley exerted himself so violently, (happily for the party, for, within ten minutes after their landing, the storm became frightfully tremendous indeed,) that he could scarce use his elegant, astonishingly strong fingers for three days after. — Mr. Monck Berkeley, and several of the Monck family, have that sort of fingers which seem as if they have neither sinews or bone in them, but, when called into action, feel like iron. The Editor used frequently to request her son, when he had given her his hand, feeling like peeling sattin, to <span class="hi">stiffen</span> it, which he would instantly do; and she conceives that no two men, without he chose it, could have unbent it. Neither his father nor his brother had their fingers so wonderfully formed by nature.</span> . begged Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e434905">[Page cccxlvi]</span> Hamilton to reject his suit, and leave him on the terrass. One day, seeing Mr. Hamilton preparing to sail,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e434994">[Page cccxlvii]</span> he screamed,<span class="q"> "Oh! dear Jemmy, pray take me with you."</span>—<span class="q"> "No, I must not; your Mamma is afraid you will be drowned."</span>Mr. Berkeley immediately walked into the Thames in his petticoats, being then little more than three years old, and pursued the boat. Mr. Hamilton, instantly putting back, asked him, if he was not afraid of being drowned, as he must have been if he had not put back. The spirited little creature replied,<span class="q"> "Aye, aye; <span class="hi">but I considered,</span> before I walked in, that you would <span class="hi">certainly</span> come back and take me before the water got up to my chin, because Mamma would have been <span class="hi">so</span> grieved if I had been drowned."</span>The same sound judgement and resolute spirit accompanied him through life.</p><p>A Scotch gentleman of consequence one day, at St. An drews, said to Dr. Berkeley,<span class="q"> "Sir, I last night saw your agree able Son as <span class="hi">fou</span> with water as most of the company were with wine."</span>Dr. Berkeley, who himself drank nothing but water, expressed his wonder at it. Mrs. Berkeley, sup posing the gentleman was a dealer in the marvellous, men tioned it to her Son in that way; to which he replied,<span class="q"> "Yes, my dear Madam, it is very true; I am often as drunk with water as others are with wine; with this, however very material difference, that when it is pro posed to break bottles, glasses, and burn chairs, tables, &amp;c. I instantly become as sober as a judge, and have sometimes prevented much mischief."</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e436178">[Page cccxlviii]</span><p>When Mr. Berkeley entered at the university of St. An drews, one of the college officers called upon him to depo sit a crown to pay for the windows he might break. Mr. Berkeley said, that<span class="q"> "as he should reside in his Father's house, it was little likely he should break any windows, having never, that he remembered, broke one in his whole life."</span>He was assured that he <span class="hi">would</span> do it at St. Andrews. He therefore made the deposit; the cause of which he some time after learned. On the rising of the session, several of the students said,<span class="q"> "Now for the win dows. Come, it is time to set off; let us sally forth."</span>Mr. Berkeley, being called upon, enquired what was to be done? They, with one voice, replied,<span class="q"> "Why, to break every window in college."</span>—<span class="q"> "For what reason?"</span>—<span class="q"> "Oh! no reason; but that it has always been done from time immemorial."</span>Mr. Berkeley sedately replied, that he begged to be excused joining the party: having never, when a <span class="hi">boy</span> at Eton, and sometimes with more wine in his head than was good for him, performed such a <span class="hi">valiant</span> feat, he should feel himself exceedingly ashamed to be guilty of it as a <span class="hi">young man. </span>He spoke so sensibly on the subject, that the practice was from that time entirely given up, and has probably never been revived. The money continued to be collected, as the following little aneodote will shew. A very good kind of man, formerly coachman at Lord Balcarras's, the College Porter, was the collector. He one day told a very intimate friend of Mr. Berkeley's, the young Laird of Kincaldrum,<span class="q"> "I am just<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e437475">[Page cccxlix]</span> come from a poor student indeed. I went for the win dow <span class="hi">croon;</span> he cried, begged, and prayed not to pay it, saying, 'he brought but a croon to keep him all the session, and he had spent six-pence of it; so I have got only four and six-pence.' How he is to live I can't tell, for they are very poor."</span>Away flew the amiable young Laird, saying,<span class="q"> "I must make a collection for him."</span>Amongst the students he first met Mr. Halket, eldest son of Sir J. Halket, a beloved Scotch friend of Mr. Monck Berkeley. This charming youth said,<span class="q"> "Here, take these few shillings; it is <span class="hi">all</span> I have till I hear from home again."</span>The young Laird said,<span class="q"> "Such an one will give a shilling, and such an one half a crown; and <span class="hi">I</span> will <span class="hi">make</span> my dear Berkeley give a crown."</span>The idea of his saying <span class="hi">make,</span> diverted the whole university, who all knew Mr. Berkeley's wonderful liberality to the poor. He soon met Mr. Berkeley, who not only tossed out the crown, but said,<span class="q"> "We will make a <span class="hi">good</span> collection; go you, Bower, (the young Laird's name,) to the Scotch, and I to the Eng lish."</span>Mr. Berkeley posted home, and made his Father, Mother, and Aunt subscribe largely, as also all the English gentlemen students. The subscription, when closed, was a very noble one. This poor youth was the son of a la bourer, who, having <span class="hi">two</span> fields, about eight miles from St. Andrews, kept <span class="hi">three</span> cows; one cow was sold to dress him for the University, and put the <span class="hi">lamented</span> croon in his pocket, to purchase coals. All the lower students study by<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e438793">[Page cccl]</span> fire light. He brought with him a large tub of oatmeal, and a pot of salted butter, on which he was to subsist from the 20th of October until the 20th of May, the space of five months, but for this lucky affair of the <span class="hi">croon,</span> and the lovely nature of the young Laird of Kincaldrum, as accom plished as amiable. In what is called in Scotland an <span class="hi">high dance,</span> this young gentleman could keep himself more than half a minute — near a minute — in air. No one, who has not seen a company of Highland soldiers dance, can form <span class="hi">any</span> idea of it, more than our great-grandsires could of electri city before Dr. Franklin's time.</p><p>The very humane worthy college cook agreed with the young Laird and Mr. Berkeley to provide him a good din ner of flesh or fish through the session. The Editor is sorry to say, some of his countrymen said,<span class="q"> "that it was not <span class="hi">quite roight</span> of these young gentlemen to make this subscription — they might be made every day."</span></p><p>This brings to the Editor's mind the <span class="hi">indignation</span> of, she is very sorry to say, <span class="hi">a Divine,</span> against her Son at Hastings, for a similar offence. On the arrival of the three hundred French clergy, within two days, at Hastings, Mr. Berkeley said to his friend Mr. Grimston,<span class="q"> "It is impossible to let these poor persecuted strangers starve in a foreign country; we must try and make a subscription for them."</span>Mr. Grimston, <span class="hi">jelon son coutume,</span> tossed down his guinea. Mr.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e439956">[Page cccli]</span> Monck Berkeley cried,<span class="q"> "Stop, stop, my dear friend, not <span class="hi">so</span> fast, you will ruin all! No, I will draw up their case, and you and I will set down against our names half a-crown each; half-a-crown cannot distress any one who has any thing to give. We may give as much more as we please, but set down only two shillings and six-pence."</span>They accordingly did so, and amongst their acquaintance got many subscribers. The paper was left at one of the circulating libraries. The following account was related to the Editor by a gentleman who was an eye-witness of the transaction. The door opened, and a stout man entered, saying,<span class="q"> "Who is <span class="hi">this</span> MR.

The corpse was soon let down into the grave, which was filled up, when every man took off his hat, bowed at the grave, and the crowd began to disperse. Mrs. Berkeley, ex ceedingly shocked at what she had witnessed, asked a very sensible intelligent looking gentleman,<span class="q"> "if he could tell her what <span class="hi">could</span> have <span class="hi">induced so very aged</span> a person to have been her own executioner,"</span>(not, as the newspapers phrase it,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">put a period</span> to their <span class="hi">existence.</span>"</span>—<span class="q"> "Alas! alas! that <span class="hi">they</span> cannot do.)"</span>— The gentleman replied,<span class="q"> "did she? poor woman!

And surely there is neither super stition or <span class="hi">Poppery,</span> as the Scotch speak Popery, in praying for <span class="hi">ourselves,</span> when God removes our friends or neighbours."</span>This gentleman, the Editor learned, was a worthy physician of Kelso. At her return to the inn, relating her anxiety on account of the poor good old Scotch woman, and her dialogue at the grave, Doctor and Mr. Berkeley laughed immoderately. Dr. Berkeley used frequently to relate it to his Scotch friends at St. Andrew's. Mr. Berkeley used to say, it was treating their dead friends just as we treat favourite dead dogs. Mr. Monck Berkeley always made his father's gardener dig an handsome grave in one of the kitchen gardens, at Cookham, for his dogs; and himself used to plant two rose trees of different sorts, one at the head, and one at the foot, of their graves, which were always kept nicely turfed; he had wonderful tenderness, and love liness in his <span class="hi">nature. </span>Dr. Berkeley's carriage, on their journey to Scotland, fre quently overtook, and was overtaken by, the hearse, containing the corpse of the sensible, amiable, well-judging, Lord Robert Kerr, who died at Newberry, in Berkshire, at the age of twenty-eight. His regiment had been quartered at Canterbury six years before. His unassuming manners, a colonel at <span class="hi">twenty-two,</span> his attachment to the worthy old grey-headed major, always consulting him in every thing relating to the regiment, endeared him to all who knew him. The Editor used to tell several worthy Scotch ministers, that she grieved to think sweet Lord Robert should be dragged so many miles to be buried like an <span class="hi">Eng lish</span> dog.</span><span style="display:block" class="p">Had Mr. Monck Berkeley retained in full force the ideas of his child hood, they could not have applied to any one <span class="hi">more</span> likely to assist them. When under four years old, playing one morning in the dressing-room, he, on a sudden, flew to his Mother, saying,<span class="q"> "Oh! Mamma, lay down your work, and <span class="hi">see about it. </span>For there is Dick States, the famous old sexton of Bray, burying a <span class="hi">poor</span> little child by <span class="hi">himself,</span> without either my Papa, or Mr. Har mer, to pray over it, or Mr. Wells, the clerk, to say Amen."</span>This pious accomplished Curate of Dr. Berkeley has an exquisitely accomplished son, educated at Oxford, who is, the Editor fears, <span class="hi">since</span> Dr. Berkeley's death, a <span class="hi">distressed</span> Divine in London. His skill in music and French, were he not a Divine, must have procured him a large salary. His father was a wonderfully fine performer on many instruments; and had the finest voice also in preaching and reading, as well as in singing, that the Editor ever heard. Mrs. Berkeley told the young <span class="hi">zealot,</span> that it was some poor little infant, that, having died very soon after its birth, had not been baptized. The Editor took care to have all her own babes baptized <span class="hi">within</span> the hour after their birth, lest a fit should carry them off. Mrs. Berkeley used to ex press her astonishment to her mother, that she permitted <span class="hi">her</span> to remain unbaptized ten days after her entrance into this<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">vale of tears.</span>"</span>It could for the first part of her life, hardly, with propriety, be styled such to her; as, after pushing forth one short cry, to <span class="hi">notisy,</span> as the Scotch phrase it, that<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">she was in life;</span>"</span>as an infant, she <span class="hi">never did cry at all;</span> which occasioned a learned <span class="hi">honest</span> physician's being consulted, to know whether she had not <span class="hi">some inward</span> disorder, that prevented her crying, as infants usually do. He replied,<span class="q"> "Not she. She is a pure healthy good-humoured little Puss; so does not plague you, or herself, by squaliing."</span>— Mr. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "Why, Mamma, <span class="hi">you</span> tell me, that God knows <span class="hi">every</span> thing <span class="hi">before</span> it happens. Now, if he <span class="hi">knew</span> that he <span class="hi">intended</span> this little child should stay such a <span class="hi">very</span> short time upon earth, <span class="hi">I</span> think it was <span class="hi">hardly</span> worth his while to give himself the <span class="hi">trouble</span> to send it down here <span class="hi">at all.</span>"</span>It is needless to add here, the Editor's comments to her <span class="hi">little</span> inquisitive <span class="hi">sceptie,</span> who, if the expression may be permitted, watched GOD's dealings with man with a most jealous eye, hoping to espy a <span class="hi">flaw. </span>His <span class="hi">com ments</span> on the twenty-seventh chapter of Genesis, which he stumbled on, rather than searched out for himself, finding he had been made to miss it in his course of reading, cost the Editor <span class="hi">much</span> trouble to rectify, although she retained an ac curate remembrance of <span class="hi">every</span> word of a sermon preached on <span class="hi">that whole chap ter</span> by the late very learned Archdeacon of Berks, Dr. Dodwell, when she was about sixteen years old.</span></span> him? "</span>— <span class="hi">Oui certainement.</span> —<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">Ah grace, au bon Dieu; quoi, Monsieur, quoi?</span>"</span>— Mr. Berkeley said he would shew it them. But he went too far, there was not a French Common Prayer Book to be procured in<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e448081">[Page cccliv]</span> Hastings. He therefore most amiably took his pen, and translated the whole of our delightful burial-service into French for them, excepting the Lesson and Psalms, which he shewed them in his Greek Testament and Latin Bible. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e448245">[Page ccclv]</span>They were in extacies with it. They wished to attend the Marquis to the grave; but feared, as the French <span class="hi">ever</span> did, being knocked down by the <span class="hi">English. </span>Mr. Berkeley assured them, the English were not <span class="hi">such</span> savages. But all in vain<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e448437">[Page ccclvi]</span> was his rhetoric, unless Monsieur <span class="hi">Berquelée</span> would<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">avoir la bontée</span>"</span>to walk at their head, as <span class="hi">chief</span> mourner for <span class="hi">le cher Marquis;</span> which, by the undertaker's omitting to bring a cloak, he did in his <span class="hi">Royal Archer's coat. </span>In a letter to his mother, he says,<span class="q"> "Do think of <span class="hi">your</span> son, marching in pro cession at the head of three hundred French Priests, as chief mourner to a poor persecuted French Noble!"</span></p><p>The elegant accomplished Bishop of (the Editor thinks) Avranches, on quitting the house of a very respectable clergyman, who kindly received and entertained him, and requested Mr. Monck Berkeley to visit and converse with him, the gentlemen not speaking French, his gratitude to Mr. Berkeley, for what his Lordship termed his <span class="hi">etonante bonté</span> to his poor brethren, and exquisitely polite attentions to him self, he declared himself at a loss for words to express. He conjured Mr. Berkeley, when things were again settled in France, that he would visit him at his palace. Alas! thou elegant amiable Prelate — thou wilt probably visit Paradise before thou doest Paris,</p><p>Mr. Berkeley often mentioned with pleasure the worthi ness and propriety of many of the three hundred clergy. Not a man would receive a shilling who had brought any money with him: others, who had friends in town, would only take barely enough to defray the expence of their journey to London.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e449488">[Page ccclvii]</span><p>Had the Editor time to look over her Son's letters, she would give his account of the landing of the good old Curate of Dieppe, aged 84; the farewel between him and his flock of sailors.

I have the delight of thinking, that GOD will go with him <span class="hi">wherever</span> he goes."</span></p><p>But to return to the subject of dancing, in which the young Laird of Kincaldrum has been already noticed. How delightfully do the Scotch dance every thing but a mi nuet! The first time the Editor saw her Son (esteemed a very good dancer, having learned in England and in France for ten years <span class="hi">de suite</span>) dance a country-dance and cotillon in Scotland, it turned her quite sick. She thought he danced like a ploughman, until some mi nuets were attempted between the country-dances; which a little consoled her. The next morning she requested Mr. Berkeley to let her treat him with a master, that he might learn to dance like a Scotch man. The offer was gratefully accepted; and the very able Mr. Jenkins attended Mr. Berkeley every day, greatly to the improvement of Mr. Berkeley, as has been above mentioned, and exceedingly through his kindness, to the finances of Mr. Jenkins, who, just before, or soon after, Mr. Berkeley quitted St. Andrews, by his wise<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e450607">[Page ccclviii]</span> advise, migrated to London, where he attended, by Mr. Berkeley's recommendation, many young persons of high rank and fashion.</p><p>Mr. Berkeley made it a point, when at Oxford, and the Temple, to spend every Christmas vacation with his Pa rents.

I will <span class="hi">not</span> stay any longer, say what you will, I am re solved."</span></p><p>The very worthy Dr. Lambe, Prebendary of Worcester, became Principal of Magdalene Hall not long after Mr. Berkeley's entering there. He happened to be in the hall when Dr. Lambe arrived; and most of the other mem bers were absent. Mr. Berkeley instantly waited on his new superior, and with his usual polite benignity offered his services in every way in which they could be useful. The Editor recollects to have heard her Son say, that, after certain necessary things performed, and dinner ended, the new Principal asked Mr. Berkeley,<span class="q"> "if they ought not to go to chapel?"</span>to which Mr. Berkeley replied in the affirmative, <span class="hi">if</span> they could get a reader, and muster a con gregation. The Editor thinks it was either the com mencement or the end of the term, and that there was only one member in the Hall besides Mr. Berkeley, who,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e453139">[Page ccclx]</span> she thinks, was the very worthy amiable, now Reverend, Mr. Sloman, a beloved, respected friend of Mr. Berkeley's, who has frequently delighted the Editor by saying,<span class="q"> "that he conceived he owed his life to Mr. Berkeley, as did many other gentlemen at the same time."</span></p><p>A party of gentlemen, many of them members of the Hall, had agreed, that on the first fine day they would sail down the river some miles — the Editor does not recollect to what place, but thinks it was to Godstow Abbey. The party consisted of eleven; and Mr. Berkeley, ever delight ing to give pleasure to young and old, begged to take with him a lad, son to a lady, a relation of his Mother's, at home for the holydays. Accordingly, on Easter Monday they set out; when they had sailed two or three miles, some accident happened to the boat; the waterman saw it coming, and threw himself out; for which Mr. Berkeley always, when mentioning it, styled him a sad villain, add ing,<span class="q"> "He left the whole number to perish, for <span class="hi">he</span> did not know that any of us could swim."</span>The boat instantly overset; only two of the party could swim, Mr. Pearce, nephew to the late Bishop of Rochester; and Mr. Monck Berkeley; being both Eton men, they were good swim mers, and soon escaped to shore, when Mr. Pearce humanely said,<span class="q"> "Berkeley, we must try to save them all. Let us go in instantly."</span>To which Mr. Berke ley replied,<span class="q"> "If we do, we are dead men, Pearce. No,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e454353">[Page ccclxi]</span> we must wait till they are more spent, or they will in fallibly cling so fast, that they will sink us."</span>This wise advice was followed. Mr. Berkeley first rescued his little kinsman, as considering himself in some sort responsible for him, as a lad of eleven years old, of whom he had taken the charge. After some little time, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Berkeley plunged in, and, by the blessing of God, brought every one safe on shore. They sent to Oxford for coaches, and on their arrival getting rid of their drenched cloaths, Mr. Berkeley immediately wrote to his Mother, assuring her, that whatever lamentable history the newspa per might happen to make of it, by the mercy of God, he had still the happiness to be able to subscribe himself her dutiful Son, &amp;c. His attentions to the feelings of his Mother,<span class="q"> "for an only Son,"</span>were incessant. The Editor had, from his youth, told Mr. Berkeley, that, if he should be expelled from Eton, or get his name entered in the Black Book at Oxford, she was very sure that she should lie down and die of grief, as she and he verily believed she would have done. He would frequently through life say,<span class="q"> "If I do so, or so, I shall kill my Mother."</span>He is receiving his blessed reward.

If, in a large company of friends, Mr. Berkeley spoke two or three times to his Mother, and she did not attend to answer him; he used to say,<span class="q"> "Well Madam, if you do not listen to me, I protest, I will call you <span class="hi">Mrs. Berke ley;</span> and that, <span class="hi">I am sure,</span> will make you mind me."</span>The Editor's sensible, agreeable friend, and <span class="hi">quondam</span> neighbour, Admiral Sir G<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>Y<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, pursues the same plan with his throughly worthy Lady; frequently saying,<span class="q"> "Aye, she wont mind me, I may call Nanny till I am hoarse; I'll say Lady Y<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>, and you'll see she'll listen to me in a minute.

There are countries where, perhaps, the younger Prelates might so admonish the elders to their profit. To the admonisher of Mr. C.

Seeing Sir Edward Hulse look out at his chariot window, he instantly took a quantity of boxes and vials, gave them to one of his <span class="hi">belaced</span> lacqueys, saying,<span class="q"> "Give my compli ments to Sir Edward; tell him, these are all I have with me, but I will send him ten dozen more to-morrow."</span>Sir Edward, astonished at the message, and effrontery of the man, actually took them into his chariot; on which the mob, with one consent, all cried out,<span class="q"> "See, see, all the Doctors, even the King's, <span class="hi">buy</span> their medicines of him."</span>In their youth, they had somewhere been fellow students; Rock, not succeeding in a regular way, metamorphosed himself into a <span class="hi">Quack. </span>In the afternoon he waited on Sir Edward, to beg his pardon for having played him such a trick: to which Sir Edward replied,<span class="q"> "My old friend, how can a man of your understanding condescend to harangue<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e483535">[Page ccclxxxiii]</span> the populace with such nonsense as you talked to-day.

Surely a <span class="hi">Spiritual</span> Court ought to have power to set such unfortunate persons at liberty. Some years ago the eldest son of a gentleman of great estate was exceedingly in love with an heiress of large fortune: the father threw cold water on it — the old gentleman persisted in refusing to give his consent — at length, violently urged by his son to find an objection to an accomplished, beau tiful, rich heiress, he replied,<span class="q"> "You d<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>d fool, the world is wide enough for you to find a wife, without marrying your own sister: that young lady is my daughter; therefore give up all thoughts of her.

The beloved object for ever gone, Miss<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>married the first man of large fortune that her parents recommended to her; but the loss of her first accomplished lover gave an unfortunate shock to her fine understanding. She early in life became a widow. The last time the Editor saw her, there appeared a sort of melancholy restlessness, that could not fail to distress every feeling heart that knew the cause. This lady had every thing <span class="hi">this</span> world could furnish, to pro duce happiness; two fine children, a son and daughter, both magnificently provided for. But she had not the society of the only man on earth whom she could love. She saw him happy with another. Had she learned to <span class="hi">feel,</span> as well as say,<span class="q"> "Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,"</span>it had been happy for her; had she humbly, patiently submitted, instead of sadly murmuring, and sadly cavilling, as she used alass! to do at some parts of Scripture.

During his short <span class="hi">séjour</span> in Dublin, he dis covered that the old servant, Mr. Richard Brinan, in whose arms Dean Swift expired, was poor as well as aged: he re lieved him, and ordered his Father's agent to pay him a small sum every month, to lighten the <span class="hi">unavoidable</span> suffer ings of old age; which <span class="hi">needs</span> not the aid of POVERTY, to render it unpleasant.

Dr. Berkeley was a too generous friend to numbers, whose present pride and covetousness has quite obliterated from their minds the poverty from which the amiable generosity of Dr. Berkeley long since rescued them. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e490811">[Page ccclxxxix]</span>HE is gone to receive his reward: THEY must in due time follow to receive theirs.</p><p>It has been mentioned, that Mr. Berkeley, in his first nove, "The Generous Rustic," has shewn his love and gra titude to the French friends of his early youth.

In that of Father Alberto, the reader is made ac quainted with the very sensible, highly accomplished, won derfully entertaining, polite, pious, Bishop Geddes, who had spent many years as a Bishop in New Spain, and has often delighted the Editor, when visiting at Dr. Berkeley's, with accounts of the wonderfully affectionate, respectful attachment the amiable Peruvians still retain for their Inca and his royal progeny, supplying him with fish, venison, game, &amp;c.; and the stratagems the Spaniards were obliged to employ to convey the then Inca from New to Old Spain, where he is a grandee.

Lord Berkeley's life, very many years before his death, had been not only exemplary, but exaltedly pious. The Editor will take leave to relate an anecdote of his Lordship and the Princess Amelia. Mrs. Berkeley happening to be staying at Lambeth Palace when Archbishop Secker related it to the late amiable Bishop Trevor, of Durham, it made so deep an impression that she can set it down verbatim. — Bishop of Durham:<span class="q"> "I cannot conceive what is come to Princess Emely lately: people don't usually grow <span class="hi">better</span> tempered as they grow old; but, from having been all her life the<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span><span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span><span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span><span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>(the blanks must be filled up by those who read) she is become so humble, so affable, so condescending, so kind and charitable (her Royal Highness used frequently to send Dr. Berkeley ten guineas, with a re quest that he would distribute it, as he thought best, amongst the poor of his parish of Acton) that it delights one to hear it; every body wonders, but nobody can tell what has caused this astonishing change. "</span>Every one at the table professed themselves glad, and contrasted it with her Royal Highness's conduct when Ranger of Richmond Park, and the odious stiles erected to deter persons from crossing it. The Archbishop, in his usual deliberate man ner, and in his wonted deliberate tone of voice, said,<span class="q"> "I can inform your Lordship what it is that has wrought this wonderful, this <span class="hi">very happy</span> change in her Royal Highness's manners and conduct. You know that my Lord Berkeley of Stratton is always one of her Royal Highness's select party. — One day she told him, she found that she grew old, and she wished his Lordship would recommend some good book to her to read, to make her better. His Lordship bowed, and said, 'he would endeavour to find one to suit her Royal Highness.' According the next time he went to Gunnersbury House, he took a large folio in his coach, and, carrying it in under his arm, presented it to her Royal Highness, saying, 'that he had obeyed her Royal Highness's commands, and had brought her a book that he hoped and be lieved she would like.'

He benevolently answered them all, and generally directed them into a track that led them right. The plan he pursued was once practised <span class="hi">against</span> himself.

The Editor has repeatedly heard Dr. Berke ley relate to various persons — (it happened before she was acquainted with Dr. Berkeley) — the Archbishop wrote to Dr. Berkeley (the letter still exists); Dr. Berkeley answered it <span class="hi">per</span> return of post, telling his Grace that, according to <span class="hi">one</span> statute he had sworn to observe, Lord Lichfield was not eligible; and, al though he respected Lord Lichfield, his conscience would not permit him to vote for him — that he had always determined not to vote <span class="hi">against</span> him; and most sincerely wished he might be elected Chancellor. Soon after Dr. Berkeley went to stay at Lambeth, he told his Grace that such a statute said so and so. His Grace replied,<span class="q"> "HAH! I believe it may; but I never understood it so before.

This, however, may be pardoned, for they are beautiful, and she repeats the hymn of which they form a part every day; but repeating her own remarks or comments she laments, as she does her <span class="hi">seeming</span> ingratitude, when, mentioning the amiable hospitality of Scotland, she perceives she has omitted to mention the very highly polite attentions received by Dr. Berkeley's family, from the very elegant sister of the worthy Lord Newark, resident at St. Andrew's when Dr. Berkeley's family went to reside there;<span class="q"> "although last, yet not least,"</span>&amp;c.</p><p>A lady, the other day, said to the Editor,<span class="q"> "that our Nobility wanted a <span class="hi">little</span> humbling; that to be sure they had carried the matter <span class="hi">much too far</span> in France; but a <span class="hi">little</span> humbling would do them service for both worlds."</span>The Editor begged that the <span class="hi">Scottish</span> in general, excepting some few, might be spared; and, as they took the advice of our blessed Master, and amiably<span class="q"> "humbled themselves, that they and some few English might be exempted from the <span class="hi">said humbling.</span>"</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e672920">[Page dxxxiii]</span><p>The Editor has not the honour to be known at present to many Noblesse,<span class="q"> "<span class="hi">The world forgetting, by the world forgot;</span>"</span>but she is apt to think that <span class="hi">modern</span> Nobility are addicted to set more value on a coronet than those to whom it has de scended by hereditary succession through several genera tions.</p><p>Mrs. Berkeley some years ago had the honour to cor respond with some English Nobles of both sexes, now no more. Very many of their letters are preserved — as polite as if <span class="hi">she</span> had been noble.</p><p>Several years ago the Editor took leave to write to a modern Peeress, requesting a very small favour for a young lady, <span class="hi">very very</span> much Mrs. Berkeley's superior, not to say by birth the Peeress's. The answer was returned on an half-sheet of common paper, sealed with a wafer pricked with a pin, expressing astonishment that the Editor could suppose she could do what she requested, — use her interest to procure a vacant twenty pounds <span class="hi">per annum</span> for a poor lady, who must have had the PAS of the Peeress until her Lord was a few years ago created a Peer. What made it <span class="hi">still stranger</span> to the <span class="hi">poor simple</span> Editor was, that when the Peeress and herself were both girls, the Peeress's lovely mother felt, at least expressed herself (she had the grace of humility)<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e673925">[Page dxxxiv]</span> obliged by the Editor's mother's attentions to her and her little girl, now the <span class="hi">little</span> Peeress. This occured not long after the Editor's return to England, and she supposed that some great revolution in politeness had taken place during her absence, and that poor untitled gentry must approach Nobility as Swift makes the subjects of Japan approach their Emperor, and<span class="q"> "lick the dust as they crawl towards him."</span></p><p>The Editor's ideas concerning a revolution in manners were, however, soon corrected, by her having the honour to receive letters <span class="hi">à l'égarde de son cher fils</span> from her amiable friend, Lord Loughborouh. An instance of his Lordship's amiability, related to her by another old friend, the agree able Mr. Berridge, the hospitable master of John à Gaunt's Castle, emboldened her, at the distance of near a quarter of a century, to write to his Lordship to introduce that dear young man, telling his Lordship,<span class="q"> "that naturalists as sure us, that the most timid animals become courageous where their young are concerned, that she felt the truth of the assertion."</span>His Lordship's, and good Lady Lough borough's attentions are carefully registered in her grateful memory. His Lordship's answer was most polite and friendly. Their amiable Graces of Marlborough, and the late excellent Lady Effingham, who have chanced to honour the Editor with letters, have written on <span class="hi">whole</span> sheets of gilt paper, most condescendingly subscribed, and sealed<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e674974">[Page dxxxv]</span> — as to a gentlewoman — not to be mantua-maker. Indeed the Editor used to write more respectfully to the famous Mrs. Munday, her old playfellow, niece of John Breedon, Esquire, of Bear-Court, Berks, when she wanted a new <span class="hi">négligée. </span></p><p>The poor lady for whom the Editor supplicated the Peeress's interest, for only a poor vacant twenty pounds <span class="hi">per annum,</span> has the honour, at least her grandfather had, and upwards for <span class="hi">very many</span> centuries, the honour to have two crowned heads, put on mourning at their decease, (as, whilst there was a King in France, was always done by that King when the head of the Courtney family died,) which the Editor is <span class="hi">very</span> sure no crowned head ever did for <span class="hi">her</span> an cestors, nor, as she verily believes, for those of Captain<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>, father of the Peeress. The poor young lady shewed her high birth, by submitting with, the Editor really thinks, unexampled fortitude and true unaffected dignity, to the distresses to which an imprudent match, in <span class="hi">very</span> early youth, had unavoidably subjected herself, her elegant husband, and lovely little girl. Although Mrs. Berkeley failed to obtain relief from the <span class="hi">courtly,</span> COURTEOUS <span class="hi">Peeress,</span> the amiable Dr. Berkeley's pocket failed not to alleviate their <span class="hi">deep</span> distress; for which the young gentleman blessed him when dying. His sensible, grateful relict and lovely daughter continue to bless his sweet memory.

Mentioning the selection Mr. Monck Berkeley first made would too plainly mark out the Peeress, who, it is hoped, although she is now turned three score, may live to grow older — and wiser. The Editor ne ver wishes<span class="q"> "her pocket cat-o-nine tails"</span>to <span class="hi">wound</span> any but the vicious and the ungrateful, and only to make the <span class="hi">insolent tingle</span> a little.

Most of the great Churches in town have what is called a Clerk in Orders; I believe they seldom officiate themselves, but ge nerally by deputy; but if they do, although in Priests<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e755116">[Page dxcviii]</span> Orders, I fancy they do not supplicate for the Congregation as this <span class="hi">zealous</span> Clerk does. There are several other curious <span class="hi">varieties,</span> but this may suffice to shew how <span class="hi">happy</span> we are in a Clerk. Pews are here exceedingly scarce; and the good Lady who <span class="hi">rented</span> this house before I took it, when she quitted the town, bequeathed her <span class="hi">non-right</span> in the pew in which she sat to a <span class="hi">little valiant Sea-officer,</span> not now in employ. He, perhaps, considering himself as at sea, crowded himself and three cousins in with Mrs Frinsham and myself (the pew is small for four persons); blustered so violently, and swore in Church, and at length prevailed, by his eloquence <span class="hi">or</span> his oaths, on the <span class="hi">respectable</span> Vestry (after all the gentlemen were retired), to write me a very curious letter indeed (it is carefully preserved by Mrs. Frinsham amongst her <span class="hi">odd</span> curiosities), forbidding me to sit in the seat any more, <span class="hi">they</span> having given it to Captain BLUS TER, and his uncle the Coal-dealer, who are much <span class="hi">too genteel</span> ever to go to Church in an afternoon, or on week days. I was beginning to fear we must attend Divine Ser vice as used to do the excellent Mrs. Yorke of Pirton, my mother's aunt, who, for some years before her death, being a cripple by the gout, was constantly lifted in and out of her coach to take the air, or make a visit, but could not drive into the Church; she was therefore regularly carried to Church twice every Sunday, and every Saint's day, Wednesdays, and Fridays, in her sedan-chair, placed in the aile, and the poles drawn out, not to incommode persons<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e756392">[Page dxcix]</span> passing to their pews; but, having at present no sedan chair, it occurred to me, that, unless the amiable Prelate of this Diocese was wonderfully altered for the worse in a few years, he would be happy to assist an old friend. I accordingly wrote to him, stating our hard case. His Lordship honoured me with a very polite answer, inclosing one to the Churchwardens of Chertsey, recommending it to them to provide me with a pew; which they immediately did, near the little Captain's, where we hear him talk, but not <span class="hi">now</span> swear and curse. — So much fore cclesiastical matters; only remarking, that the title bestowed on the Curate of Chertsey, as Mr. White told us, is the <span class="hi">Journeyman</span> Parson.

It has been often asserted, that NO young lady, brought up by Mrs. Sheeles and the pious sensible Mrs. Gambier, ever lost their character, excepting a wretched little girl, who, long before she attained the age of fourteen, was one Christmas holydays, after she had been about a year in Queen's Square, SOLD by her vile Guardian to a vile<span class="gap" title="blank">_+</span>shire 'Squire, whose mother ill-using the poor VERY <span class="hi">weak</span> girl, contemporary with the Editor, she ran away from him. The poor creature, as many others have done, experienced the truth of the wise Spanish Proverb,<span class="q"> "bien et casada que tien ni Sugero ni Canada."</span>Mrs. Sheeles sadly lamented to Mrs. Berkeley, about thirty years ago, that she suffered herself to be persuaded by Lady<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>to take her daughters. No two Earls daughters in England have exceeded these two<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>ladies in a variety of<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>matches. Mrs. Sheeles was a most accomplished woman, of very good family, grand-daughter of the excellent Sir John Smith, cousin-german to the late<span class="gap" title="blank"> _____ </span>Lord Montford. It always rejoices Mrs. Berkeley to hear of the happiness and prosperity of her grand-children.</span> Sheeles's twenty different sets of company came, Mrs. then Miss Anne Frinsham was certain to exhibit to every different company. Her ear for music was so exquisitely accurate, that the Editor has frequently, in her youth, and a very little before her lamented death, heard her say, that, when at school, (always in mischief,) like, and perpetually with, her dearly beloved friend, the wonderfully sensible, highly cultivated, accomplished Mrs. A. Langley, of the Manor-house, York, she has repeatedly <span class="hi">tried</span> to dance out of time, but never could do it more than two steps, the third was not in her power. It used to be said by the governesses, teachers, &amp;c. <span class="q"> "The eldest Miss Frinsham looks as if she would fly over the moon, the youngest as if butter would not melt in her mouth; yet Miss Frinsham is never in mischief, Miss Anne never out of it."</span>It was innocent mischief, although it subjected the two Miss Annes frequently to have recourse to their Common Prayer Book to learn a Psalm, sometimes to their Bible to learn a chapter by heart, esteemed a pretty weighty, although not a disgraceful, punishment, like the Fool's-cap or the Red-tongue. Schools well conducted are excellent places for children of both sexes surely. Mrs. Frinsham used through life to laugh, and tell Dr. and Mr. Monck Berkeley, when the Editor used to say,<span class="q"> "that <span class="hi">as a girl she</span> found no pleasure in <span class="hi">their escampades</span> to the parlour door at night,"</span>&amp;c.<span class="q"> "Aye, she was a <span class="hi">poor, pusillanimous, stupid, little puss. </span>She would never get up after she was in bed, never slip out of the school-room. She never saw the kitchen at Mrs. Sheeles's in her life. She was a sad poor coward indeed."</span></span>, and the appearance of her eyes, seemed to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e790922">[Page dcxxvi]</span> be <span class="hi">praising,</span> rather than supplicating that Saviour-God whom she had laboured so faithfully to serve for very many years.</p><p>Although her outward sufferings were very heavy, all was bright within. No self-reproach for <span class="hi">broken</span> SABBATHS, for neglect of public worship on WEEK DAYS, one grand cause of the decay of Christian piety in this Nation, which the Editor, doomed, alas! to attend dying beds, has twice witnessed, to her great distress, not, blessed be God, either<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e791273">[Page dcxxvii]</span> her Mother, Son, or Husband! Her sole anxiety was on account of her poor, now, alas! throughly forlorn, deso late, <span class="hi">trebly-widowed</span> Sister, left to struggle alone, with variety of perplexing businesses, without one near, dear relative to counsel and to soothe her; yet, blessed be the mercy of an all-gracious God, she was enabled to say to her almost idolizing Sister,<span class="q"> "Dearest of friends, I am not ALONE; for God is with me, <span class="hi">will</span> be with me. I have been constantly, as you know, praying to him from the age of seventeen, '<span class="hi">Cast me not away in the time of age, when my strength faileth, when I am grey-headed.</span>' And he has graciously promised ALL his <span class="hi">real</span> children, '<span class="hi">I</span> will NEVER leave thee, nor <span class="hi">forsake</span> thee.' And I may adapt the language of Holy David, and instead of saying, 'When my Father and my Mother forsake me, the LORD taketh me up.' But, when it pleases HIS wisdom to chastize his poor sinful child, by taking from her her idolized Son, her tenderly beloved Husband, her darling Sister; HE <span class="hi">will</span> take her up, and conduct her safely, she wishes she might presume to say shortly, to the realms of bliss, there to rejoin those lovely spirits, her dear happy TRIO, to part no more."</span>The lovely Saint was <span class="hi">exceedingly</span> consoled to find that the Giver of every good gift had, in the midst of <span class="hi">such anguish</span> of soul, vouchsafed such a measure of his <span class="hi">best gift,</span> FAITH.

The above choice was made just a month before his death, when in good health, in high gay spirits, being just come in from playing with some of his school-fellows.</div>! </div><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e876098">[Page 166]</span><div id="o5280-l09865" class="l"> "I ask not earthly treasures to obtain:</div><div id="o5280-l09870" class="l">" Be poverty my lot, if Christ's my gain<span id="o5280-n01500_return"><a title="When he was but seven years old, reading that part of the Gospel, where our blessed Saviour says, &#34;How hardly shall they that are rich enter into the …" href="#o5280-n01500" class="notelink collapsed" aria-controls="o5280-n01500" aria-expanded="false" data-toggle="collapse"><sup>‡</sup></a></span><div id="o5280-n01500" class="collapse note "><sup>‡</sup> <p>When he was but seven years old, reading that part of the Gospel, where our blessed Saviour says,<span class="q"> "How hardly shall they that are rich enter into the kingdom of Heaven!"</span>he started, dropped the Bible on the table, and said:<span class="q"> "What, can NO rich people go to Heaven?"</span>Being desired to proceed, and see what would follow, he redde,<span class="q"> "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven."</span>He added,<span class="q"> "Then, I am sure, it is impossible."</span>On being told, that Christ says, how hard it is for those, who trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; and that riches are apt to draw off the heart from God, although that is not always the case; he laid down his book, considered some time in silence, then addressed his Mother as before,<span class="q"> "Mamma, Mamma, pray listen to me!"</span>and said,<span class="q"> "I do desire to be poor, and to go to Christ, rather than to be very rich, and live without him."</span>He naturally loved money exceedingly, and never parted with it willingly, but to the poor.

His Father and Aunt used to amuse themselves with borrowing six pence of him, and then pretending they could not pay it, that they might witness his <span class="hi">extreme</span> anxiety not to lose it.

What a contrast to his generous Brother! Yet both were delightfully amiable children in their different ways. It is supposed, that Bishop Berkeley was <span class="hi">naturally</span> a lover of money. An Irish nobleman, an intimate friend of the Bishop's, often mentioned to the Editor, that, on his <span class="hi">urging</span> Bishop Berkeley to accept the primacy offered to him by Lord Chesterfield, the Bishop replied,<span class="q"> "No, my dear Lord, I very early in life got the love of money here," (lifting up his leg, and setting it down with such force, that it shook his library, and every thing in it;) "and here, by the grace of God, I will <span class="hi">always</span> keep it."</span>This was uttered in the most energetic tone of voice. A younger brother of Dr. Berkeley's, who died at about seventeen, had the same spirit as his little nephew. The Bishop early gave his sons a large allowance for cloaths, &amp;c. A collection was making for a distressed Baronet. The Bishop called on his sons to contribute. Dr. Berkeley flew to his room, and brought down twenty guineas. The Bishop said,<span class="q"> "Willy, where is yours?"</span></p><p>William. —<span class="q"> "Presently, my Lord."</span></p><p>Bp.

Mrs. Farrant, a neighbour's daughter, lived from her early youth many years in Dr. Berkeley's family. She is one of the best tempered of women. Her little charge, when very young, one night took it into his head that he would sing two or three lines of a little song upon every step as he ascended the stair-case. Mrs. Berkeley, happening to pass, stood still to listen, and overheard the amiable servant say,<span class="q"> "Come, Sir, come you must go up quicker, or I must call my Mistress."</span>To which he replied,<span class="q"> "No, no, my dear Molly, I know very well you won't <span class="hi">do that.</span>"</span>On which Mrs. Berkeley presenting herself, the little man skipped off to his room in an instant, and his Mother said,<span class="q"> "Molly, how many fibs you do tell that child! for you know that you never told a tale of him in your life, nor would if he was to torment you from morning till night."</span>—<span class="q"> "No, to be sure Madam, I should not; for at last, by threatening him with YOU, I get him to do what he should do."</span>Mrs. Berkeley, till within these very few years, made an annual grateful offering to a worthy woman, who lived with her mother when SHE was six years old, for not telling of her when she climbed the trees like a boy.</div> who always waited upon him,<span class="q"> "Molly teach me to pray."</span>She replied, with tears,<span class="q"> "My angel, God will teach you to pray."</span>He said, with great earnestness,<span class="q"> "Lord, teach my heart to pray."</span>He had always been told, that the prayer which <span class="hi">reacheth</span> to God must come <span class="hi">from</span> the <span class="hi">heart,</span> and with the heart this lovely creature often did pray. He always used Bishop Kenn's prayers and hymns in The Winchester Scholar. Whenever Mrs. Berkeley was alone, her children always offered their prayers, and repeated or sang their hymns with her. One evening, as he was repeating the following verse in Bishop Kenn's evening hymn,<div class="q"><div id="o5280-l10185" class="l">But though sleep o'er my frailty reigns,</div><div id="o5280-l10190" class="l"> Let it not hold me long in chains,</div><div id="o5280-l10195" class="l"> And now and then let loose my heart,</div><div id="o5280-l10200" class="l"> Till it an Hallelujah dart —</div></div>his Mother desired him to omit it, saying,<span class="q"> "Although it might suit the exalted piety of Bishop Kenn, it was in him (little <span class="hi">Robert</span>) mocking God, as she did not believe he had devotion sufficient to wish to wake in the middle of the night to praise God."</span>He stood about a minute silent, pensive; then replied,<span class="q"> "Why, Mamma, I do desire to awake to praise God in the night; so, if you please to give me leave, I will say it as I always do when I say it to Molly Phipps,"</span>the very worthy woman above named, who doated on him, and he on her. His Mother rejoiced that her child excelled her in piety, she always omitting it herself. He was, perhaps, the most ingenious and accomplished little creature any where to be seen. As his brother was resolved not to learn to read, so he seemed resolved to learn without being taught. He would conjure his mother not to tell him, and clap his little hand over her mouth, lest she should begin, or rather go on speaking; but, as he termed it, let him <span class="hi">guess it out</span> himself, how words were to be spelt or pronounced. At the age of four and an half he redde as well as he could have done at fourteen. He could find out in the Calendar the lessons for the day, for Sundays, and holydays, whilst he remained in petticoats. On <span class="hi">week</span> days, he sat with his Mother in the seats appropriate to the Prebendaries 'Ladies. The amiable worthy lady of the late Dr. Caryl, both of whom doated on him, used to say,<span class="q"> "It is like the idea one has of praying in Heaven, to hear this <span class="hi">little</span> Cherubring this great choir when he chaunts. I really believe he understands better what he is about than half the <span class="hi">grown-up people</span> that come hither."</span>Accident discovered to his mother the strength of his memory: her own was once pretty good, she having often heard her mother say, that she learned the alphabet at once shewing; that the next day she knew every letter: but Robert much excelled his mother. Mrs. Berkeley, being a pretty good <span class="hi">Bible scholar,</span> used to work with her needle, as she never put out any work of any sort or kind, whilst her children were reading the Scriptures. In History, Geography, &amp;c. that would not do. One day, observing little Robert going on perfectly right, and finding his eyes fixed at the other end of the room, she enquired what he was at, looking off his book? He replied,<span class="q"> "Why, Mamma, you know when one has redde any thing <span class="hi">in</span> the book <span class="hi">once,</span> one can read it <span class="hi">without</span> the book afterwards; and a little while ago I redde this chapter <span class="hi">in</span> the book in the servants 'hall Bible; so now I can <span class="hi">read</span> it <span class="hi">without</span> the book to you to-day."</span>A boy, having cut off some of his fine curling ringlets, which hung below the bottom of his back, he was very angry, and said,<span class="q"> "He would never forgive him."</span>— His Mother assured him,<span class="q"> "He would go to hell if he did not."</span>— He then replied,<span class="q"> "Then, I will forgive him; <span class="hi">but I will never forget it.</span>"</span>—<span class="q"> "Yes, you must, or God will not love you."</span>—<span class="q"> "Well then, if God <span class="hi">will have</span> me forget it, he must MAKE me do it, for I never did forget any thing I ever heard or saw in my whole life."</span>When a little child, not being allowed scissors for fear of his beautiful eyes, he with his fingers pinched out in paper, birds, beasts, ships, flowers, &amp;c. so accurately as was astonishing; he drew very finely; his second lesson, a cow's head, is preserved as a prodigy of genius. He danced delightfully, and could go through all the military exercise of the infantry, Dr. Berkeley always paid a serjeant for attending his Sons. He spoke French as fluently as he did English. He, as well as his Brother, repeated by heart, and acted delightfully. He chaunted and sang finely. His beloved school-fellows were, lovely little Tatton, the present sensible, worthy, Samuel Saw-bridge, esq. of Ollantigh, and the learned Dr. Herbert Packe, son of the celebrated Dr. Packe, of Canterbury. The Saturday on which he sickened in the evening, he flew up at twelve o'clock, to conjure his Mother, to give him permission to invite<span class="q"> "my dear Sam to dinner to-day."</span>It was, alas! the last dinner he ever ate; he sickened about eight in the evening. Here follows a proof of this gentleman's honesty in very early youth. <span class="hi">Some</span> of the Upper School Boys had a <span class="hi">shameful</span> trick of <span class="hi">robbing</span> the very worthy Mrs. Longley, in the church-yard, of <span class="hi">a dozen</span> oranges when they <span class="hi">purchased half a dozen. </span>It was necessary to have one little boy as an assistant to this honourable action. Samuel Sawbridge was enticed; to which he sensibly, nobly replied,<span class="q"> "What! take Mrs. Longley's oranges <span class="hi">without paying</span> for them! Miss Tucker teaches me my Catechism; and that says," THOU SHALT NOT STEAL; "and <span class="hi">she</span> tells me," that taking any thing from any body, without paying for it, <span class="hi">is stealing;</span> so I won't go with you. "</span>This gentleman not then quite seven years old, all Canterbury rang with this tale. Mrs. Berkeley asked her little Robert if he thought he should have been as honest as his dear friend Samuel? To which he made the following reply:<span class="q"> "God knows — God knows, my dear Mamma, if I had been tempted, what <span class="hi">I might</span> have done; THANK God, THANK God, they did not <span class="hi">ask</span> me;"</span>and he shuddered as he energetically uttered the reply. This lovely creature was, to be sure, wonderfully ambitious. He repeatedly, until told it was a wicked idea, asked his mother,<span class="q"> "Mamma, if I was to read Greek and Latin all day and all night, and study violently hard, could I come to be a King? I should <span class="hi">like</span> to be a King."</span>Such a thought never entered the head of his dear brother, nor perhaps of any other child.</div>!

About a fortnight before his lamented death he received a letter from a gentleman of the Commons, telling<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28531e898529">[Page 186]</span> him that the Court had rejected the will of Captain Lawley.</p><p>It were much to be wished that the Ecclesiastical Court could sometimes act as a Court of EQUITY. They would, they should surely, had they been applied to, have set aside the will of a wretched old Fanatic of Hull, who after having kept his dutiful, amiable, only son near nine years with an eminent Clergyman of the Church of England, who takes private pupils, sent him down to Scotland to the University of St. Andrew's; as he wrote to Dr. Forrest, one of the Professors,<span class="q"> "that he might learn to preach the <span class="hi">everlasting Gospel,</span> as a <span class="hi">Presbyterian</span> minister in England."</span>Mr. Rogers was accordingly, to his great distress, entered of the Divinity Colledge.

Miss Talbot, ever chearful, evèr delighting to look forward with joy to <span class="hi">that</span> world where she, through faith, well knew that happiness <span class="hi">was</span> to be found, which she <span class="hi">too</span> well knew <span class="hi">was not</span> to be found here, said,<span class="q"> "I never could bear that Poem of Norris's."</span>Several, with one voice, exclaimed,<span class="q"> "Who could have written a finer on <span class="hi">that</span> subject?"</span>She, laughing, replied,<span class="q"> "Any one."</span>Some one said,<span class="q"> "I wish you would, then."</span><span class="q"> "Well, go get me the book, and a pen; and I will at least, if not make a better, mend that;"</span>which she immediately certainly did as above. This is copied from the altered one in the hand-writing of that loveliest of women. That entirely beloved friend, who gave it to the Editor the next day, by whom it has been carefully preserved for more than thirty years, she (Miss Talbot) saying,<span class="q"> "I cannot bear to hear persons, who I really think believe in the all-sufficiency of Christ, admire such stuff as<div class="q"><div id="o5280-l10295" class="l"> "Death could not a more <span class="hi">sad</span> retinue find,</div><div id="o5280-l10300" class="l">" Sickness and Pain before — <span class="hi">Darkness</span> behind. " </div></div></span>Poets sometimes take <span class="hi">strange</span> flights. Good Mr. Norris, in one of his Poems, shocked the Editor, when she was a very young woman, hardly a woman; — saying, in his Poem on the death of some young Norfolk lady,<span class="q"> "that Heaven wanted the presence of her (I think Mrs. Margaret Pastarn's) spirit, to make it a place of <span class="hi">complete</span> happiness."</span>She flew to her Mother, to enquire if it was not BLASPHEMY. Were Mrs. Frinsham still on earth, the Editor would not trouble her concerning those lines, she thinking of them just as she did at fifteen. She blesses GOD that no <span class="hi">such</span> flights are to be found in Mr. Monck Berkeley's Poems. The Editor cannot omit mentioning here two short con versations held with her Son at the distance of almost ten years. When a <span class="hi">very</span> young man, he shewed to his Mother some charming verses that he had written to a friend on the death of a <span class="hi">very near</span> and dear relation. His Mother said,<span class="q"> "You seem to offer all your consolation from Heathen Philosophers."</span>He replied,<span class="q"> "Best of Mothers! what could I do? Would you have had me offered it from the Bible to a man <span class="hi">that you</span> know does not believe that blessed Book!"</span>The second, near ten years after — Mrs. Berkeley said,<span class="q"> "My dear, I dare say, although <span class="hi">I</span> am no judge, that the lines are very fine; but there is not a <span class="hi">tittle</span> said of the <span class="hi">only</span> thing that could console <span class="hi">you,</span> were the Almighty to deprive you of your poor Mother — that she was gone to Christ."</span>Mr. Berkeley looked sweetly sad, and replied,<span class="q"> "Oh, best of Mothers! <span class="hi">But I could</span> not offer THAT consolation concerning one who I have, alas! <span class="hi">too good</span> reason to fear <span class="hi">did not</span> believe <span class="hi">in</span> CHRIST — Surely SUCH <span class="hi">can never go to</span> HIM. I have said all that my <span class="hi">conscience</span> would suffer me to say, to soothe a <span class="hi">little</span> the anguish of their spirits on the loss of an <span class="hi">agreeable</span> Mother."</span>Christ says,<span class="q"> "Except ye believe that I AM, ye shall die in your sins."</span>What a threat to SOCINIANS and to the ARIANS! Lord Monboddo, in his "Ancient Metaphysics," says,<span class="q"> "The ARIAN HERESY was the <span class="hi">subtlest</span> that ever infected the Christian Church."</span>Many years ago, a gentleman on a visit at Dr. Berkeley's at Cookham said, that, in his way through London on the preceding Sunday, resting on the Sabbath day, he had heard the following sentence uttered from the pulpit by a very learned Divine, preaching on the above-cited words of our adored Redeemer,<span class="q"> "If ye believe not that I AM,"</span>&amp;c.<span class="q"> "If JESUS CHRIST be not GOD, perfectly equal with the Father, I had <span class="hi">rather trust</span> to the BLOOD of a DOG for my Salvation than to that of CHRIST, who, if not <span class="hi">absolutely equal</span> with the Father, <span class="hi">is</span> an IMPOSTOR."</span>Some one said,<span class="q"> "That is very <span class="hi">strong</span> lan guage!"</span>Dr. Berkeley replied,<span class="q"> "But it is certainly right, or true,"</span>(the Editor forgets which word he used. Whatever ARIAN can be happy enough to lay eyes on the <span class="hi">wonderful</span> work of the late very deeply learned Reverend Meredith Jones, many years Chaplain to the present venerable Lord Bishop of Chichester,<span class="q"> "must be convinced."</span>The Editor has one, which she lends out for one week only: if not returned, she threatens the borrower with an <span class="hi">action of trover. </span></div><h1><span class="head">.</span></h1></header><div id="o5280-s01005" class="lg"><div id="o5280-l10305" class="l">IT must be done, my Soul!
