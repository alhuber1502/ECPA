to fortune.

from Metastasio.

unstable goddess! why, with care severe,
 still do thou strew with thorn my rugged path? 
think thou i tremble at thy frown? or ever
 will crouch submissive to avert thy wrath? 
preserve thy threat for thy unhappy slave,
 the shudder victim of thy treacherous power;
 my soul, thou know, amid overwhelm wave,
 shall smile superior in the rough hour. 
with i as oft as thou will proud wage
 the combat urge by thy malicious ire,
 full well thou know, that from thy baffle rage
 my soul have seem fresh vigour to acquire;
 so the bright steel beneath the hammer blow
 more polish, more refine, and keen grow.
