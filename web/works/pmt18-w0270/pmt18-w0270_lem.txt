to the memory of Margaret Tighe:

take from we June 7th, 1804. — ætat 85. 

sweet, placid spirit! bless, supreme bless,
 who life be tranquil, and who end be rest;
 it be not for thou our general tear shall flow,
 our loss be selfish, selfish be our woe:
 we mourn a common parent, common friend,
 centre, round who thy child love to bend:
 where hand divide, meet again to move
 in one sweet circle of unite love:
 we mourn the tender, sympathise heart
 so prompt to aid, and share the sufferer part;
 the liberal hand, the kindly patient ear,
 pity soft sigh, and ever ready tear;
 the graceful form, yet lovely in decay,
 the peace inspire eye benignant ray;
 the lip of tenderness that soothe the sad,
 and love to bid the innocent be glad;
 the gentle, soften, reconcile word,
 the ever cheerful, hospitable board:
 the unassuming wisdom, pious prayer,
 the still renew, prolong, maternal care:
 all — all be lose! — of thou, bless saint, bereave,
 we mourn, to who impoverish life be leave:
 mourn for ourselves! secure thy lot must be,
 with those who pure in heart their god shall see.
