write in the hermitage of Braid

surround with the shade tree,
 entrance in sweet delight,
 i hail the day, i bless the hour,
 which give i life and light. 

though from my birth the child of chance,
 i prize what heaven have lend;
 and with the little that be my lot,
 i feel myself content. 

do not the beauteous orb of heaven
 impartial dart his beam,
 alike to all the wood, the hill,
 the gentle fall stream? 

do not the god who make they thus,
 alike impartial deal? 
he do â€” have vain delude man
 the sense to see and feel. 

if i again behold this day,
 and languish in distress,
 thou, power supreme, support my soul,
 and make the struggle less. 

but if it be thy gracious will,
 to give i health and ease,
 with grateful heart i will praise thy name
 below these shade tree.
