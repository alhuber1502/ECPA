o thou, who labour in this rugged mine

by miss cooper (now mrs. madan) in her brother coke upon Littleton.

o thou, who labour in this rugged mine,
may thou to gold the unpolished over refine!
may each dark page unfold its haggard brow!
doubt not to reap, if thou can bear to plough.
to tempt thy care, may each revolve night,
purse and mace swim before thy sight!
from hence in time to come, adventurous deed!
may thou essay, to look and speak like Mead.
when the black bag and rise no more shall shade
with martial air the honour of thy head;
when the full wig thy visage shall enclose,
and only leave to view they learn nose:
safe may thou defy beaux, wit, and scoffer;
while tenant, in fee simple, stuff thy coffer.
