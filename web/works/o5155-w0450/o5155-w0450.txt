O Thou, who labour'st in this rugged mine

By Miss COOPER (now Mrs. MADAN) in her Brother's Coke upon Littleton.

O Thou, who labour'st in this rugged mine,
May'st thou to gold th' unpolish'd ore refine!
May each dark page unfold its haggard brow!
Doubt not to reap, if thou canst bear to plough.
To tempt thy care, may each revolving night,
Purses and maces swim before thy sight!
From hence in times to come, advent'rous deed!
May'st thou essay, to look and speak like Mead.
When the black bag and rose no more shall shade
With martial air the honours of thy head;
When the full wig thy visage shall enclose,
And only leave to view they learned nose:
Safely may'st thou defy beaux, wits, and scoffers;
While tenants, in fee simple, stuff thy coffers.
