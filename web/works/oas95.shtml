For what could be a more moving consideration, then that a Lady, who had all that Youth, Beauty, Virtue, and Power could bestow, should be so suddenly snatch'd from us? A Lady that was serv'd by the Sword, and celebrated by the Pen of my Lord <span class="hi">Cutts. </span>Though indeed, if we rightly esteem'd things, we should lament for our <span class="hi">own</span> sakes, not <span class="hi">Hers;</span> so Poor a thing it is to make an Evil of that, which is certainly the kindest Boon of Nature, our <span class="hi">Dissolution. </span>But the Men of Honour are not so ungratefull to their <span class="hi">Friend</span> Death, as to look at him in the ghastly dress the World gives him, of Rawbones, Shackles, Chains, Diseases, and Torments; they know that he is so far from bringing such Company, that he relieves us from 'em. So little is there in what Men make such Pother about, and so much is it an Irony to call it <span class="hi">brave</span> to expire calmly, and <span class="hi">resolution</span> to go to rest. This<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29679e1344">[Page]</span> is no News to your Lordship, whom Death has so often allur'd with the <span class="hi">Glory</span> of Dangers, and with the <span class="hi">Beauty</span> of Wounds, I'll not be so Poetical to say, your Muse hover'd about you, and sav'd you inspight of the many you have receiv'd, but am sure, I may say, she'll preserve you, when you can receive no more: For <span class="hi">Apollo</span> is a Physician ev'n <span class="hi">after Death:</span> As to my Verses, all, methinks, on the Dead Queen ought to be address'd to your Lordship; who, in the Dedication of your own Works, best adorn'd her Living; if Good for your Entertainment, Bad for your Pardon; if, when these are thrown aside, an Eye cast upon 'em introduces the mention of so excellent a Princess, where otherwise She had not been spoken off, I have my full end; nor do I think I come late on a Subject, which all Good Men will Eternally dwell upon; I am sensible how short I have fall'n of expressing the gracefull concern of some Honourable Personages, whose Names I have presum'd with; I design'd 'em only an oblique Commendation, and nam'd 'em for the very Reason they walk'd at the <span class="hi">Funeral,</span> which was not to showe themselves, but to do Honour to the Queen. But should it prove any way offensive, <span class="hi">I</span> hope to shun their, and your Lordship's Resentment by the concealment of my name, and borrow the unknown Knight's device, in Sir <span class="hi">Philip Sidney,</span> of the Fish <span class="hi">Sepia,</span> which when catch'd in the Net, casts a black Ink about it, and so makes it's escape.
