on mrs. lâ€”s.  

such sweetness and goodness together combine;
 so beauteous her face, and so bright be her mind;
 so love, yet chaste; and so humble, yet fair;
 so comely her shape, and so decent her air;
 so skilful, that nature improve by her art;
 so prudent her head, and so bounteous her heart;
 so wise without pride, and so modest neat;
 it be strange, this agreeable creature be a cheat! 
for, though she to man, for a mortal, be give,
 these virtue betray her extraction from heaven.
