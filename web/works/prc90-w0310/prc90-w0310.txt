ON MR ****** ACTOR

GReat child of nature, well you play your part,
 Yet nature sure would need a little art. 
Excuse me ****** but I'm forc'd to tell,
 In nought so much as bawling you excell. 
And where there's no occasion for a storm,
 Your head's too giddy, and your blood too warm. 
For instance now, when men are making love,
 They bill and coo, as gentle as the dove;
 But you, all foaming like a savage bear,
 Attempt with blust'ring cries to move the fair. 
How inconsistent, vain unthinking boy,
 To rage a tyrant, while you look a toy. 
You gain applause â€” good faith, I grant it true,
 Nothing like roaring charms the vulgar crew. 
But men, whose judgement's rather more acute,
 Astonish'd stare, with indignation mute.
