Written in the Beginning of MEZERAY's History of FRANCE.

I.

Whate'er thy Countrymen have done
 By Law and Wit, by Sword and Gun,
 In Thee is faithfully recited:
 And all the Living World, that view
 Thy Work, give Thee the Praises due,
 At once Instructed and Delighted. 

II.

Yet for the Fame of all these Deeds,
 What Begger in the Invalides,
 With Lameness broke, with Blindness smitten,
 Wished ever decently to die,
 To have been either Mezeray,
 Or any Monarch He has written? 

III.

It strange, dear Author, yet it true is,
 That down from Pharamond to Lo√ºis,
 All covet Life, yet call it Pain:
 All feel the Ill, yet shun the Cure:
 Can Sense this Paradox endure? 
Resolve me, Cambray, or Fontaine. 

IV.

The Man in graver Tragic known
 (Tho' his best Part long since was done)
 Still on the Stage desires to tarry:
 And He who play'd the Harlequin,
 After the Jest still loads the Scene,
 Unwilling to retire, tho' Weary.
