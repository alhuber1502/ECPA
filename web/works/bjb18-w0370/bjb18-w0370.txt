SECOND DEVOTIONAL SONG.

OUR heavenly Father sent his Son
 From hateful sin to save us,
 And precious blessings many a one,
 Health, friends and freedom gave us. 

And all we see, each beauteous sight,
 The woods, the fields, the ocean,
 The sun by day, the moon by night,
 Should fill us with devotion. 

Then let our praises be expressed
 In light and lively measure,
 He loves the grateful homage best
 That is bestowed with pleasure.
