second devotional song.

our heavenly father send his son
 from hateful sin to save we,
 and precious blessing many a one,
 health, friend and freedom give we. 

and all we see, each beauteous sight,
 the wood, the field, the ocean,
 the sun by day, the moon by night,
 shall fill we with devotion. 

then let our praise be express
 in light and lively measure,
 he love the grateful homage best
 that be bestow with pleasure.
