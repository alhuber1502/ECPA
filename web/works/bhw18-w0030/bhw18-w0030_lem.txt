the bastille,

a vision.

i 

 "drear cell! along who lonely bound,
 unvisited by light,
 chill silence dwell with night,
 save where the clang fetter sound! 
abyss, where mercy never come,
 nor hope the wretch can find;
 where long inaction waste the frame,
 and half annihilate the mind! 

ii.

 "stretch helpless in this live tomb,
 o haste, congenial death! 
seize, seize this linger breath,
 and shroud i in unconscious gloom. 
Britain! thy exile son no more
 thy blissful vale shall see —
 why do i leave thy hallow shore,
 ah, land adore, where all be free?" 

iii.

bastille! within thy hideous pile,
 which stain of blood defile,
 thus rise the captive sigh,
 till slumber seal his weep eye. 
terrific vision hover near! 
he see a awful form appear! 
who drag his step to deep cell,
 where stranger, wild horror dwell! 

iv.

 "o! tear i from these haunt wall,
 or these fierce shape control! 
lest madness seize my soul! 
that ponderous mask of iron fall,
 i see—" "rash mortal, ha! beware,
 nor breathe that hide name! 
shall those dire accent wound the air,
 know death shall lock thy stiffen frame. 

v. 

 "hark! that loud bell which sullen toll! 
it wake a shriek of woe
 from yawn depth below;
 shrill through this hollow vault it roll! 
a deed be do in this black cell
 unfit for mortal ear —
 a deed be do when toll that knell,
 no human heart can live and hear! 

vi.

 "arouse thou from thy numb glance,
 near yond thick gloom, advance;
 the solid cloud have shake;
 arm all thy soul with strength to look —
 enough! — thy start lock have rose —
 thy limb have fail — thy blood have freeze! —
 on scene so foul, with mad affright,
 i fix no more thy fasten sight. 

vii.

 "those trouble phantom melt away! 
i lose the sense of care —
 i feel the vital air —
 i see — i see the light of day! 
vision of bliss! — eternal power! 
what force have shake those hate wall? 
what arm have rend those threaten tower? 
it fall — the guilty fabric fall!" 

viii.

 "now, favour mortal, now behold! 
to soothe thy captive state
 i open the book of fate;
 mark what its register unfold:
 where this dark pile in chaos lie,
 with nature execration hurl,
 shall freedom sacred temple rise,
 and charm a emulate world! 

ix.

 "it be her awaken voice command
 those firm, those patriot band;
 arm to avenge her cause,
 and guard her violate law! —
 do ever earth a scene display
 more glorious to the eye of day,
 than million with accord mind,
 who claim the right of human kind? 

x.

 "do the fame roman page sublime
 a hour more bright unroll,
 to animate the soul,
 than this love theme of future time? —
 posterity, with rapture meet,
 the consecrate act shall hear;
 age shall the glow tale repeat,
 and youth shall drop the burn tear! 

xi.

 "the peasant, while he fond see
 his infant round the hearth
 pursue their simple mirth,
 or emulous climb his knee,
 no more bewail their future lot,
 by tyranny stern rod oppress;
 while freedom cheer his straw-roofed cot,
 and tell he all his toil be bless! 

xii.

 "philosophy! o, share the meed
 of freedom noble deed! 
it be thy each truth to scan,
 and dignify the rank of man! 
it be thy all human wrong to heal,
 it be thy to love all nature weal;
 to give our frail existence worth,
 and shed a ray from heaven on earth."
