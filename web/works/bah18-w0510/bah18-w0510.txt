THE SPIRIT'S SONG.

HARK what I tell to thee,
 Nor sorrow o'er the tomb,
 My spirit wanders free,
 And waits till thine shall come. 

All pensive and alone,
 I see thee sit and weep,
 Thy head upon the stone,
 Where my cold ashes sleep. 

I watch thy speaking eyes,
 And mark each precious tear,
 I catch thy parting sighs,
 Ere they are lost in air. 

HARK what I tell to thee,
 Nor sorrow o'er the tomb,
 My spirit wanders free,
 And waits till thine shall come.
