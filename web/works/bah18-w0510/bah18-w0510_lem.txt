the spirit song.

hark what i tell to thou,
 nor sorrow over the tomb,
 my spirit wander free,
 and wait till thy shall come. 

all pensive and alone,
 i see thou sit and weep,
 thy head upon the stone,
 where my cold ash sleep. 

i watch thy speak eye,
 and mark each precious tear,
 i catch thy part sigh,
 ere they be lose in air. 

hark what i tell to thou,
 nor sorrow over the tomb,
 my spirit wander free,
 and wait till thy shall come.
