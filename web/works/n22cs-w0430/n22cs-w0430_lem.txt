sonnet [43] xliii.

the unhappy exile, who his fate confine
 to the bleak coast of some unfriendly isle,
 cold, barren, desert, where no harvest smile,
 but thirst and hunger on the rock repine;
 when, from some promontory fearful brow,
 sun after sun he hopeless see decline
 in the broad shipless sea — perhaps may know
 such heartless pain, such blank despair as i;
 and, if a flatter cloud appear to show
 the fancy semblance of a distant sail,
 then melt away — anew his spirit fail,
 while the lose hope but aggravate his woe! 
ah! so for i delusive fancy toil,
 then, from contrast truth — my feeble soul recoil.
