a translation of the latin epitaph on sir THOMAS Hanmer.

by the same.

thou, who survey these wall with curious eye,
 pause at this tomb where hanmer ash lie;
 his various worth through vary life attend,
 and learn his virtue, while thou mourn his end. 

his force of genius burn in early youth,
 with thirst of knowledge, and with love of truth;
 his learning, join with each endear art,
 charm every ear, and gain on every heart. 

thus early wise, the endanger realm to aid,
 his country call he from the studious shade;
 in life first bloom his public toil begin,
 at once commence the Senator and man. 

in business dextrous, weighty in debate,
 thrice ten long year he labour for the state;
 in every speech persuasive wisdom flow,
 in every act refulgent virtue glow. 
suspend faction cease from rage and strife,
 to hear his eloquence, and praise his life. 

resistless merit fix the senate choice,
 who hail he speaker, with unite voice. 
illustrious age! how bright thy glory shine,
 when Hanmer fill the chair, and ANNE the throne. 

then, when dark art obscure each fierce debate,
 when mutual fraud perplex the maze of state,
 the moderator firm mild appear,
 behold with love, with veneration hear. 

this task perform, he seek no gainful post,
 nor wish to glitter at his country cost;
 strict, on the right he fix his steadfast eye,
 with temperate zeal, and wise anxiety;
 nor ever from virtue path be lure aside,
 to pluck the flower of pleasure or of pride. 

her gift despise, corruption blush and flee,
 and fame pursue he where conviction lead. 

age call at length his active mind to rest,
 with honour sate, and with care oppress;
 to letter ease retire, and honest mirth,
 to rural grandeur, and domestic worth;
 delight still to please mankind, or mend,
 the patriot fire yet sparkle in the friend. 

calm conscience then his former life survey,
 and recollect toil endear the shade;
 till nature call he to the general doom,
 and virtue sorrow dignify his tomb.
