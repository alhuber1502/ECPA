Lysander to cloe.

it be true, my wish will never find
another nymph so fair, so true;
since all that be bright, and all that be kind,
in those expressive eye i view.

and i with grateful zeal can haste
to china for the mere toy;
can scorch on lybia barren waste,
to give my dear a moment joy.

but fickle as the wave or wind,
i once may flight those lovely arm;
pardon a free ingenuous mind,
i do not half deserve thy charm.

if i in any praise excel,
it be in soft theme to paint my flame;
but cloe sweetness bid i tell,
i shall not long remain the same.

i know its season will expire,
replace by cool esteem alone;
nor more thy matchless breast admire
than i detest and scorn my own.

this interval my fate allow,
and friendship dictate all i say;
o shun to hear my future vow,
when giddy love resume the lay.

so some poor maniac can foresee
the random hour of madness nigh;
he mourn the fates severe decree,
and caution who he love to fly.
