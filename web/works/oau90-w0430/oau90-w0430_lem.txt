a second burlesque letter write for a friend, suppose to be a cuckold ghost, come from hell, and answer a satyr of STUM claret his brother vintner; with a conjugal reprimand to Salacia his late mournful widow.

in limbo where there loud howl
cuckold, and cuckold maker soul,
where courtier with their wealth and wit
be dame as well as snivel cit;
and lady fair, with shape divine,
be rank with Ioan that milk the kine.
where country knight, and country clown,
esquire and ploughman be all one;
to show all fool who pride do seize,
hell and the grave know no degree;
there be a dismal smoky hole,
the cell of many a wretched soul,
who sin of marriage be occasion
of his remediless damnation.
a crew of ghost infest this place,
pale monster of so strange a race,
that torture imp this cavern shun,
as far more dreadful than their own,
round a blue fire compose of soul,
of rampant wife instead of coal,
poor cockold come, and fry by turn,
and thump each other with their horn,
like rut deer, with antlet large,
or ram they vigorous charge,
doom to this kind of punishment,
for give a ill president;
and change bless single life,
for that perpetual plague a wife,
from this forlorn eternal grave,
which Belzebub call cuckold cave,
this melancholy brimstone bed,
i come to answer Tory Ned,
and school a woman that surprise,
nay quite outdo all hell with vice:
but first, dull ghost, how can it be,
that thou shall dare to lash at i,
with thy late fenceless poetry.
thou have in hell, i be sure, thy share,
if devil can show justice there,
for every deadly sin of thy,
million against thy head combine
who thou have poison with dame wine,
and though i be with these horn make rich,
for marry a salacious Bâ€”
shake thy and i in bag together,
you will find there be chastity in neither;
thy will have fear no tongue reproach,
for set of her cask a broach,
have not age cool she by degree,
and sink the liquour to the lees,
then what a plague make thou a roar,
and scribble on my fubse whore;
for be she in her fame as odious,
as the lewd wife of Cesar Claudius,
that twenty five one morning try,
yet go away unsatisfied;
or pose the world in these lewd time
with a new catalogue of crime,
she in the vicious mystery
can never outdo thy wife and thou;
the cause of all her crime have be,
because to thou she be near of kin,
she may have prove a hopeful piece
have she not chance to be thy niece;
for as in cock of game there be
a metal which can never miss,
where if the breed be true, not one,
shall ever leave the pit and run:
so it be in kindred understand,
vertue and vice run in the blood,
and whore and rogue from each relation,
descend to the twentieth generation;
if this be true, thou wretched ghost,
how do thou dare to leave thy post,
when thou be bottle Molten lead,
which be in hell thy daily trade,
as punishment for many a cheat,
do in thy transitory state,
to dam thy self by poetry
upon Agario and i?
thy haggard genius vile spend
her heat, for know, as fate intend
cuckold be always make by friend,
it be your friend still that top your spouse,
for stranger come not to your house,
at least to have acquaintance there,
like friend familiar and near,
and i with he be satisfy,
in all thing that concern my bride,
for whether husband be or not,
if their wife itch, it will be so;
therefore leave off, good Ned, in time,
and tempt no more my rage in rhime,
for i agario muse inherit,
and double portion of his spirit;
and shall so thump thy clod brain,
if thou do dare to write again,
the devil shall think it a abuse,
to have in hell so dame a muse,
and send thou back to mortal life,
condemn to a worse plague thy wife.
and now i talk of wife, i groan
to think how i must maul my own,
though ill, i will not let thou use she,
i have a title to abuse she;
and must long smother silence break,
loser have always leave to speak,
and if that common rule prevail,
sure cuckold may have leave to rail.
* oh thou swear foe to all my ease,
thou curse disturber of my peace,
when live i no rest can have,
nor now can find it in the grave,
thy mischief be so manifold,
they have pierce through the crumble mould,
and raise i from the shade again
to be divulger of thy sin,
waste not enough, oh thou Obsceen.
proud, salt, lascivious, rampant quean;
that i have endure the country scorn,
and draw within my hat my horn;
and when i have broach some hogshead new,
have see some other tap you;
yet small account of the object make,
believe it be to force a trade:
have i not hide my patient noddle,
when bully rock have call for bottle,
and take you to some inner room,
to beat a march upon your drum?
nay, to complete thy nauseous crime,
when friend Agario come sometime;
when thou with flatter smile have meet he,
and thy mouth water to be at he;
i like a man that know good breed,
have slip away no matter heed,
because a friend of he we make,
and for each kiss he sound pay,
and can thou be a base detractor,
of one so much thy benefactor,
and with dame female spite decry,
one that know all as oft as i,
that do our family such good,
and be so free to amend our blood;
to we and to our son, pox rot he,
be full as kind as if he get he,
though a true rogue as ever twang,
and will in all due time be hang,
for to what end can he be bring,
that by thy moral have be teach;
and can thou, worse than fiend of hell,
thou jilt incomprehensible;
can thou forswear thing plain as light,
nay thing unquestionable right,
and do not pillory plague thy mind
with loss of ear which wretch find,
that be in spite of conscience blind;
plain be thy sex vice by thou,
make obvious to posterity:
that when a woman once grow lewd,
no art can turn she back to good,
the spread seed have take root,
and spite of industry will shoot,
our wholesome grain we vain sow,
spite of our art the tares will grow,
and gay and flourish appear,
as if the devil have sow they there;
no woman of the former time
arrive to know thy height of crime,
thy falsehood, baseness, perjury,
ingratitude and villainy,
be never know in this degree;
for have the scripture ever express,
a woman with thy devil possess,
our saviour will have be in doubt
whether his power can cast'em out,
the herd of swine have be too small,
and never have contain they all;
how happy then be that good man,
that cloak thy sin now i be go,
that at the Mark still wide shoot,
and wear with pleasure my old boot,
or if the truth be plain find,
the boot of all the country round?
faith if a cuckold ever behave
himself with merit to be save,
thy case, poor fool, be singular,
for thou have so much hell from she,
it be even pity thou shall know
a second penance here below.
can thou not find, egregious sot,
why thou be marry, or for what?
can thou be ignorant of all
the vermin in her trap do fall?
and never know 'till it be too late,
thy morsel be but for a bait;
or that it be thy noble place
to father all her spurious race,
that if she whelp a squaul lad,
the todpole imp may call thou dad;
although by man of all degree.
compound like a Chetworth cheese;
or be it real thy want,
bring thou to wed this widow saint,
as no one know a wretch case,
except he feel the same distress,
if so, thou be fall from bad to worse,
no poverty be half the curse
of he that have to dam his life,
a rampant strumpet for his wife,
thus say the fate, and last tell
thy precious mate, that i from hell,
and fiend that fill each gloomy room,
where she at last must sure come,
ascend to purge each vile offence,
and urge she to repent her sin,
with tear deny what late she swear,
and never henceforth play the whore;
else from my melancholy tomb,
with troop of ghost again i will come,
and fierce drag she hence to slaughter,
where all her priest and holy water,
with all the aid and foppery they can make,
shall never have the power to bring she back.
