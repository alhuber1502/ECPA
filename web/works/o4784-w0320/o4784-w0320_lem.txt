the executor. 

a greedy heir long wait to fulfil,
 as his executor, a kinsman will;
 and to himself his age repeat over,
 to his infirmity still add more;
 and nice keep the account of the expect store:
 when death, at last, to either give release,
 make one pain, the other be long cease;
 who to the grave must decent convey,
 ere he possession take the kindred clay,
 which in a coach be place, wherein he ride,
 and so no hearse, or follow train provide;
 reject Russel, who will make the charge
 of one dull tedious day, so vast large. 
when, at his death, the humble man declare,
 he wish thus private to be inter. 
and now, the luggage move in solemn state,
 and what it want in number, gain in weight. 
the happy heir can scarce contain his joy,
 while sundry muse do his thought employ,
 how he shall act, now every thing be he own,
 where his revenge, or favour shall be show;
 then recollect, draw a counterfeit groan. 
the a venue, and garden shall be change,
 already he the furniture have range,
 to ransack secret drawer his fancy fly,
 nor can the appear wealth his mind suffice. 
thus he a age run over betwixt the porch
 of his friend house, and the adjacent church
 while the slow Driver, who not reckon keep
 of what be leave, indulge nature, sleep;
 till on a bank, so high, the wheel be bear
 that in a moment all must overturn:
 while the rich heir now find the give dead
 less weighty in his gold, than in his lead;
 which fall just on his contrive breast,
 expel the soul, leave the corpse to rest
 in the same grave, intend for his friend. 
then why shall we our day in wish spend
 which, ere we see fulfil, be often at a end
