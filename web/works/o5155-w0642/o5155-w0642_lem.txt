book ii. ode xii. translate.

the war of Numantia and Hannibal dire,
on land, or on ocean the fighting,
Maecenas, never suit my peaceable lyre,
in subject much soft delight.

you love not of centaur embattle to hear,
nor of giant, a tale of such wonder,
who shake all the sky, make Jupiter fear,
until drive by alcides and thunder.

in prose, my good patron, more noble you write,
as your topic than these be much better,
how Caesar with glory can govern and fight,
and lead haughty king in his fetter.

alone my gay muse of Licinnia will sing,
the constant, good-natured, and pretty,
so graceful to dance with the maid in a ring,
so sparkle, so merry, and witty.

while you play with her hair that be careless curl,
while this way, now that way she twitch,
of your tease so kind complain, no world
can bribe for one lock with its riches.

thus bless with the nymph, how transport the joy!
who whimsical, wanton, amuse;
who pleasing forward, or pretty coy,
oft snatch the kiss she refuse.
