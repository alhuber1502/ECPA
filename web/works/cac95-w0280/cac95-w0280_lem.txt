ode on truth.

address to GEORGE Dyer.

where fancy paint with nature simple hue,
 and music soul-entrancing concord join,
 there shall my number hail the modest muse,
 as fervent she pour the generous line! 
while noble thought my ardent soul inspire
 to catch a glimpse of truth, and glow with nature fire. 

o truth! pure virtue uncorrupted source! 
how long shall art refract thy glorious ray,
 or prejudice repel thy genuine force,
 till mortal eye can scarce endure the blaze? 
how impious thus to quit the heavenly light
 for folly idle glare, and taper of the night! 

you, in who bosom passion hold its sway,
 who wild ambition prompt to raise a name;
 who, wander far from nature sober way,
 will rush impetuous to the mount of fame;
 know, while the steep with eager step you climb,
 that, truth must give you strength, truth only be sublime. 

whether you mingle with the ecstatic throng
 who thrill with skilful touch the sound wire;
 or dare the lofty flight of heavenly song;
 or to the painter noble art aspire;
 whatever the path, whatever mean be try,
 nature and truth your step must always guide. 

yet be thou hide, fair truth, from human eye,
 exist pure, yet never unsullied find. 
O! clear those cloud which still infest our sky,
 dissolve those specious show which still confound;
 burst every limit which obstruct thy ray,
 and to the mental eye unfold a cloudless day. 

thou, who fraternal love and freedom fire,
 who wide benevolence unbounded flow,
 who unaffected muse those truth inspire
 which prove that nature in thy bosom glow;
 through thou have truth shoot forth her potent beam,
 and simple nature praise resound in thy theme. 

that lyre, which sweet tune its polish strain,
 and sing of pity, liberty, and peace,
 the muse shall invite to strike again,
 and may their virtuous votary still increase! 
still truth, through thou, shall dart her pure ray,
 and simple nature woo thy modest, plaintive lay.
