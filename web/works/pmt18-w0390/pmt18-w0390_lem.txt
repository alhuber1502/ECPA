the lily.

may, 1809. 

how wither, perish seem the form
 of yond obscure unsightly root! 
yet from the blight of wintery storm,
 it hide secure the precious fruit. 

the careless eye can find no grace,
 no beauty in the scaly fold,
 nor see within the dark embrace
 what latent loveliness it hold. 

yet in that bulb, those sapless scale,
 the lily wrap her silver vest,
 until vernal sun and vernal gale
 shall kiss once more her fragrant breast. 

yes, hide beneath the moulder heap
 the undelighting slight thing;
 there in the cold earth bury deep,
 in silence let it wait the spring. 

oh! many a stormy night shall close
 in gloom upon the barren earth,
 while still, in undisturbed repose,
 uninjured lie the future birth;

and ignorance, with sceptic eye,
 hope patient smile shall wonder view;
 or mock her fond credulity,
 as her soft tear the spot bedew. 

sweet smile of hope, delicious tear! 
the sun, the shower indeed shall come;
 the promise verdant shoot appear,
 and nature bid her blossom bloom. 

and thou, o virgin queen of spring! 
shall, from thy dark and lowly bed,
 burst thy green sheath silken string,
 unveil thy charm, and perfume shed;

unfold thy robe of pure white,
 unsullied from their darksome grave,
 and thy soft petal silvery light
 in the mild breeze unfettered wave. 

so faith shall seek the lowly dust
 where humble sorrow love to lie,
 and bid she thus her hope entrust,
 and watch with patient, cheerful eye;

and bear the long, cold, wintery night,
 and bear she own degrade doom,
 and wait till heaven revive light,
 eternal spring! shall burst the gloom.
