upon listen to the vibration of a clock.

instructive sound! i be now convince by thou
 time in its womb may bear infinity. 
how the past moment die, and throb no more! 
what world of part compose the roll hour! 
the least of these a serious care demand;
 for though they be little, yet they be golden sand:
 by some great deed distinguish all in heaven,
 for the same end to i by number give! 
cease, man, to lavish sum thou never have tell! 
angel, though deathless, dare not be so bold!
