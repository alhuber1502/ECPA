hymn on the title of Christ.

i 

arise, my soul, arise
 thy saviour sacrifice! 
all the name that love can find,
 all the form that love can take
 Jesus in himself have join,
 thou, my soul, his own to make. 

ii.

equal with god, most high,
 he lay his glory by:
 he, the eternal god be bear,
 man with man he deign to appear,
 object of his creature scorn,
 please a servant form to wear. 

iii.

hail everlasting lord,
 divine, incarnate word! 
thou let all my power confess,
 thou my late breath proclaim;
 help, you angel choirs, to bless,
 shout the love immanuel name. 

iv.

fruit of a virgin womb
 the promise blessing come:
 Christ the father hope of old,
 Christ the woman conquer seed,
 Christ the saviour! long foretell,
 bear to bruise the serpent head. 

v. 

refulgent from afar
 see the bright morning-star! 
see the day-spring from on high
 late in deep darkness rise,
 night recede, the shadow fly,
 flame with day the open sky! 

vi.

our eye on earth survey
 the dazzle shechinah! 
bright, in endless glory bright
 now in flesh he stoop to dwell
 god of god, and light of light,
 image of the invisible. 

vii.

he shine on earth adore
 the presence of the lord:
 god, the mighty god and true,
 god by high heaven confess,
 stand display to mortal view,
 god supreme, for ever bless. 

viii.

Jesus! to thou i bow
 the almighty fellow thou! 
thou, the father be only son;
 please he ever be in thou,
 just and holy thou alone
 full of grace and truth for i. 

ix.

high above every name
 Jesus, the great i be! 
Bows to Jesus every knee
 thing in heaven, and earth and hell,
 saint adore he, demon flee,
 fiend and man and angel feel. 

x. 

he leave his throne above
 empty of all, but love:
 who the heaven can contain
 god vouchsafe a worm to appear,
 lord of glory, son of man,
 poor, and vile, and abject here. 

xi.

his own on earth he seek,
 his own receive he not:
 he, a sign by all blaspheme,
 outcast and despise of man,
 he they all a madman deem,
 bold to scoff the Nazarene. 

xii.

hail galilean king! 
thy humble state i sing;
 never shall my triumph end,
 hail deride majesty,
 Jesus, hail! the sinner friend,
 friend of publican â€” and i! 

xiii.

thy eye observe my pain
 thou good Samaritan! 
spoil i lie and bruise by sin,
 gasp my faint, expire soul,
 wine and oil thy love pour in,
 close my wound, and make i whole. 

xiv.

hail the life-giving lord,
 divine, engraft word! 
thou the life my soul have find,
 thou the resurrection prove:
 dead i hear the quicken sound,
 own thy voice; believe, and love! 

XV. 

with thou go up on high
 i live, no more to die:
 first and last, i feel thou now,
 witness of thy empty tomb,
 Alpha and Omega thou
 be, and art, and art to come!
