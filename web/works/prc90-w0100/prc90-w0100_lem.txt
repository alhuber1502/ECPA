word of course

of all your friend, when at your last resource,
 avoid the man that deal in word of course. 
damon in love, he swear, with you alone;
 another come, his heart be not all your own. 
yet still he swear, and still he keep his word,
 nor ever break it, till appear a third. 
Alexis now be kneel at my foot;
 it be strange, he can see i on the street. 
sandy my friend, no other aid i claim;
 in time of need, ah! sandy change his name! 
i start other day, when Willie say
 to Jessie, you be a most unequalled maid. 
she smile, he sneer, i stare he in the face;
 he whisper i, these word be common place. 
they be, it be well, too long i have feel their force,
 curse on your folly, and your word of course!
