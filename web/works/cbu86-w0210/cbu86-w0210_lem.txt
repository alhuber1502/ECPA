to a mountain-daisy,

on turn one down, with the plough, in April — 1786. 

we, modest, crimson-tipped flower,
 thou' meet i in a evil hour;
 for i must crush among the stour
 thy slender stem:
 to spare thou now be past my power,
 thou bony gem. 

alas! it be not thy neebour sweet,
 the bony lark, companion meet! 
bend thou among the dewy weet! 
wi spreckle breast,
 when upward-springing, blythe, to greet
 the purple east. 

cauld blow the bitter-biting north
 upon thy early, humble birth;
 yet cheerful thou glint forth
 amid the storm,
 scarce rear above the parent-earth
 thy tender form. 

the flaunt flower our garden yield,
 high-shelt'ring wood and wall must shield,
 but thou, beneath the random bield
 of clod or stane,
 adorn the histie stibble-field,
 unseen, alone. 

there, in thy scanty mantle clad,
 thy snawie bosom sunward spread,
 thou lift thy unassuming head
 in humble guise;
 but now the share uptear thy bed,
 and low thou lie! 

such be the fate of artless maid,
 sweet floweret of the rural shade! 
by love simplicity betray,
 and guileless trust,
 till she, like thou, all soil, be lay
 low in the dust. 

such be the fate of simple bard,
 on life rough ocean luckless starred! 
unskilful he to note the card
 of prudent lore,
 till billow rage, and gale blow hard,
 and whelm he over! 

such fate to suffer worth be give,
 who long with want and woe have strive,
 by human pride or cunning drive
 to misery brink,
 till wrench of every stay but heaven,
 he, ruin, sink! 

even thou who mourn the daisy fate,
 that fate be thy — no distant date;
 stern ruin plough-share drive, elate,
 full on thy bloom,
 till crush beneath the furrow weight,
 shall be thy doom!
