line address to a mother in Ireland.

will she, who kind maternal care
 enlighten my untutored mind,
 who all her joy with i do share,
 but to her breast each grief confine,

accept these tear that free flow â€”
 accept this tributary lay? 
it be all that friendship can bestow,
 or weep gratitude repay. 

whether constraint my footstep lead
 amid a hate world, or free
 i wander over the russet mead,
 my constant thought be fix on thou. 

on lehena enchant scene,
 i muse, where we delight stray;
 the slope hill, the valley green,
 the lawn in bright flower array. 

say, do thou in those meadow rove,
 where taste with nature be combine? 
or do thou haunt that silent grove,
 that charm so oft my pensive mind? 

o may those scene a bliss bestow
 which rural life alone can boast;
 and thou, dear friend, each comfort know,
 which by thy absence i have lose. 

may sprightly health, with rosy lip
 breathe rich vermilion over thy cheek! 
light round thy path may pleasure trip,
 and young content with aspect meek! 

may science gild each tedious hour,
 and spread her store before thy eye:
 and friendship with resistless power,
 repress each sad intrude sigh! 

may peace around thy honour head
 her fair olive wreath entwine;
 soft slumber guard thy downy bed,
 and hope, fond charmer, still be thy! 

may truth and innocence descend,
 their pure blessing to impart;
 blessing that on thyself depend,
 unknown but to the virtuous heart! 

yet, when thy circle friend appear,
 and greet thou on ierne shore,
 devote one sympathetic tear
 to she who see thou now no more!
