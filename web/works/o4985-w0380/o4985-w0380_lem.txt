ode on saint cecilia day.

by the same.

i 

from your lyre-enchanted tower,
 you musical mystic power,
 you, that inform the tuneful sphere,
 inaudible to mortal ear,
 while each orb in ether swim
 accordant to the inspire hymn;
 hither paradise remove,
 spirit of harmony and love! 
thou too, divine Urania, deign to appear,
 and with thy sweetly-solemn lute
 to the grand argument the number suit;
 such as sublime and clear,
 replete with heavenly love,
 charm the enrapture soul above. 
disdainful of fantastic play,
 mix on your ambrosial tongue
 weight of sense with sound of song,
 and be angelical gay. 

ii.

and you, you son of harmony below,
 how little less than angel, when you sing! 
with emulation kindle warmth shall glow,
 and from your mellow-modulating throat
 the tribute of your grateful note
 in union of piety shall bring. 
shall echo from her vocal cave
 repay each note the shepherd give,
 and shall not we our mistress praise,
 and give she back the borrow lay? 
but farther still our praise we pursue;
 for even Cecilia, mighty maid,
 confess she have superior aid —
 she do — and other rite to great power be due:
 high swell the sound and high:
 let the wing number climb:
 to the heaven of heaven aspire,
 solemn, sacred, and sublime:
 from heaven music take its rise,
 return it to its native sky. 

iii.

music a celestial art;
 cease to wonder at its power,
 though lifeless rock to motion start,
 though tree dance light from the bower,
 though roll flood in sweet suspense
 be hold, and listen into sense,
 in penshurst plain, when Waller, sick with love,
 have find some silent, solitary grove,
 where the vague moonbeam pour a silver flood
 of tremulous light athwart the unshaven wood,
 within a hoary moss-grown cell,
 he lay his careless limb without reserve,
 and strike, impetuous strike each querulous nerve
 of his resound shell. 
in all the wood, in all the plain,
 around a lively stillness reign;
 the deer approach the secret scene,
 and weave their way through labyrinth green;
 while Philomela learn the lay,
 and answer from the neighbour bay. 
but Medway, melancholy mute,
 gentle on his urn recline,
 and all-attentive to the lute,
 in uncomplaining anguish pine:
 the crystal water weep away,
 and bear the tiding to the sea:
 Neptune in the boisterous sea
 spread the placid bed of peace,
 while each blast,
 or breathe its last,
 or just do sigh a symphony and cease. 

iv.

behold Arion — on the stern he stand,
 pall in theatrical attire,
 to the mute string he move the enliven hand,
 great in distress, and wake the golden lyre:
 while in a tender orthian strain
 he thus accost the mistress of the main:
 by the bright beam of cynthia eye,
 through which your wave attract rise,
 and actuate the hoary deep;
 by the secret coral cell,
 where love, and joy, and Neptune dwell,
 and peaceful flood in silence sleep;
 by the sea-flower, that immerge
 their head around the grotto verge,
 dependent from the stoop stem;
 by each roof-suspended drop,
 that light linger on the top,
 and hesitate into a gem;
 by thy kindred watery god,
 the lake, the rivulet, fount and flood,
 and all the power that live unseen
 underneath the liquid green;
 great Amphitrite (for thou can bind
 the storm, and regulate the wind)
 hence waft i, fair goddess, oh waft i away,
 secure from the man, and the monster of prey! 

v. 

he sing — the wind be charm to sleep,
 soft stillness steal along the deep,
 the Triton and the nereid sigh
 in soul-reflecting sympathy,
 and all the audience of water weep. 
but Amphitrite her dolphin send — the same,
 which erst to Neptune bring the noble perjure dame. —
 please to obey, the beauteous monster fly,
 and on his scale as the gild sunbeam play,
 ten thousand variegate die
 in copious stream of lustre rise,
 rise over the level main, and signify his way. —
 and now the joyous bard, in triumph bear,
 ride the voluminous wave, and make the wished-for shore. 
come, you festive, social throng,
 who sweep the lyre, or pour the song,
 your noble melody employ,
 such as become the mouth of joy;
 bring the sky-aspiring thought,
 with bright expression rich wrought;
 and hail the muse ascend on her throne,
 the main at length subdue, and all the world her own. 

vi.

but over the affection too she claim the sway,
 pierce the human heart, and steal the soul away;
 and as attractive sound move high or low,
 the obedient ductile passion ebb and flow. 
have any nymph her faithful lover lose,
 and in the vision of the night,
 and all the day-dream of the light,
 in sorrow tempest turbulent toss —
 from her cheek the rose die,
 the radiation vanish from her sun-bright eye,
 and her breast, the throne of love,
 can hardly, hardly, hardly move,
 to send the ambrosial sigh. 
but let the skilful bard appear,
 and pour the sound medicinal in her ear:
 sing some sad, some plaintive ditty,
 steep in tear that endless flow,
 melancholy note of pity,
 note that mean a worldof woe;
 she too shall sympathize, she too shall moan,
 and pity other sorrow sigh away her own. 

vii.

wake, wake the kettle-drum, prolong
 the swell trumpet silver song,
 and let the kindred accent pass
 through the horn meander brass. 
arise — the patriot Muse invite to war,
 and mount bellona brazen car;
 while harmony, terrific maid! 
appear in martial pomp array:
 the sword, the target, and the lance
 she wield, and as she move, exalt the pyrrhic dance. 
tremble the earth, resound the sky —
 swift over the fleet, the camp she fly
 with thunder in her voice, and lightning in her eye. 
the gallant warrior engage
 with inextinguishable rage,
 and heart unchilled with fear;
 fame number all the choose band,
 full in the front fair victory stand,
 and triumph crown the rear. 

viii.

but hark the temple hollow roof resound,
 and Purcell live along the solemn sound. —
 mellifluous, yet manly too,
 he pour his strain along,
 as from the lion Samson slay,
 come sweetness from the strong. 
not like the soft italian swain,
 he trill the weak enervate strain,
 where sense and music be at strife;
 his vigorous note with meaning teem,
 with fire, with force explain the theme,
 and sing the subject into life. 
attend — he sing Cecilia — matchless dame! 
it be she — it be she, — fond to extend her fame,
 on the loud chord the note conspire to stay,
 and sweet swell into a long delay,
 and dwell delight on her name. 
blow on, you sacred organ, blow,
 in tone magnificent slow;
 such be the music, such the lay
 which suit your fair inventress praise:
 while round religious silence reign,
 and loiter wind expect the strain. 
hail majestic mournful measure,
 source of many a pensive pleasure! 
bless pledge of love to mortal give,
 as pattern of the rest of heaven! 
and thou, chief honour of the veil,
 hail, harmonious virgin, hail! 
when death shall blot out every name,
 and time shall break the trump of fame,
 angel may listen to thy lute:
 thy power shall last, thy bay shall bloom,
 when tongue shall cease, and world consume,
 and all the tuneful sphere be mute.
