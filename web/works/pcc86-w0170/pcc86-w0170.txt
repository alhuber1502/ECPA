The three following beautiful Stanzas by Miss A. H. to the Author.

As musing I wander'd along
 The green banks where you often have stray'd,
 Where the thrush sweetly warbles her song,
 And primroses paint the gay mead;

I heard from the sad moaning dove,
 The loss of her mate who was true;
 And sighs from each tree of the grove,
 Lamenting the absence of you. 

Has Cinthia a heart to refuse
 The wish of each nymph on the plain;
 The wood, that's a friend to her Muse,
 Invokes her return here again.
