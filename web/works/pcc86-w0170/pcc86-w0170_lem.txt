the three follow beautiful stanza by miss a. H. to the author.

as muse i wander along
 the green bank where you often have stray,
 where the thrush sweet warble her song,
 and primrose paint the gay mead;

i hear from the sad moan dove,
 the loss of her mate who be true;
 and sigh from each tree of the grove,
 lament the absence of you. 

have Cinthia a heart to refuse
 the wish of each nymph on the plain;
 the wood, that be a friend to her muse,
 invoke her return here again.
