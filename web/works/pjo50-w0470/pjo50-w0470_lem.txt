birthday.

shall this day unheeded fly,
 and like vulgar day pass by? 
dull as — though i be,
 shall it pass unsung by i? 
no, when i this day forget,
 may i share that poet fate! 
sing what be daily say,
 rhyme what be never read. 

now for blessing, such as ease,
 health and joy, long life and peace. 
pray we next — for poet may
 sure, as well as prose-folk, pray —
 and as this day roll around,
 may you still be perfect find:
 still, in virtue noble race,
 press for the foremost place;
 scorn all that be low, or lewd,
 dare to be great and good:
 till your race of life be do,
 and the glorious meed your own;
 such as angel now receive,
 such as heaven alone can give.
