Gotham.

book i 

far off (not matter whether east or west,
 a real country, or one make in jest)
 not yet by modern mandevilles disgrace,
 nor by map-jobber wretched misplace,
 there lie a island, neither great nor small,
 which, for distinction sake, i Gotham call. 

the man, who find a unknown country out,
 by give it a name acquire, no doubt,
 a gospel title, though the people there
 the pious christian think not worth his care. 
bar this pretence, and into air be hurl
 the claim of Europe to the western world. 

cast by a tempest on the savage coast,
 some rove buccaneer set up a post;
 a beam, in proper form transverse lay,
 of his redeemer cross the figure make,
 of that redeemer, with who law his life,
 from first to last, have be one scene of strife;
 his royal master name thereon engrave,
 without more process, the whole race enslave,
 cut off that charter they from nature draw,
 and make they slave to man they never know. 

search ancient history, consult record,
 under this title the most christian lord
 hold (thanks to conscience) more than half the ball;
 overthrow this title, they have none at all. 
for never yet may any monarch dare,
 who live to truth, and breathe a christian air,
 pretend that Christ (who come, we all agree,
 to bless his people, and to set they free)
 to make a convert ever one law give,
 by which converter make he first a slave. 

spite of the gloss of a cant priest,
 who talk of charity, but mean a feast,
 who recommend it (while he seem to feel
 the holy glow of a real zeal)
 to all his hearer, as a deed of worth,
 to give they heaven, who they have rob of earth,
 never shall one, one true honest man,
 who, bless with liberty, revere her plan,
 allow one moment, that a savage sire
 can from his wretched race, for childish hire,
 by a wild grant, their all, their freedom pass,
 and sell his country for a bit of glass. 

or grant this barbarous right, let Spain and FRANCE,
 in slavery breed, as purchaser advance,
 let they, while conscience be at distance hurl,
 with some gay bauble buy a golden world;
 an Englishman, in charter freedom bear,
 shall spurn the slavish merchandise, shall scorn
 to take from other, through base private view,
 what he himself will rather die, than lose. 

happy the savage of those early time
 before europe son be know, and europe crime! 
gold, curse gold! sleep in the womb of earth,
 unfelt its mischief, as unknown its worth;
 in full content he find the true wealth;
 in toil he find diversion, food, and health;
 strange to the ease and luxury of court,
 his sport be labour, and his labour sport;
 his youth be hardy, and his old age green;
 life morn be vigorous, and her eve serene;
 no rule he hold, but what be make for use;
 no art he learn, nor ill which art produce;
 false light he follow, but believe they true;
 he know not much, but live to what he know. 

happy, thrice happy now the savage race,
 since Europe take their gold, and give they grace! 
pastor she send to help they in their need,
 some who can write, with other who can read,
 and, on sure ground the gospel pile to rear,
 send missionary felons every year;
 our vice, with more zeal than holy prayer,
 she teach they, and in return take they;
 her rank oppression give they cause to rise,
 her want of prudence mean, and arm supply,
 while her brave rage, not satisfy with life,
 rise in blood, adopt the scalping-knife;
 knowledge she give, enough to make they know
 how abject be their state, how deep their woe;
 the worth of freedom strong she explain,
 while she bow down, and load their neck with chain;
 faith too she plant, for her own end impress,
 to make they bear the worst, and hope the best;
 and while she teach on vile int'rest plan,
 as law of god, the wild decree of man,
 like phariser, of who the scripture tell,
 she make they ten time more the son of hell. 

but whither do these grave reflexion tend? 
be they design for any, or no end? 
brief but this â€” to prove, that by no act
 which nature make, that by no equal pact
 betwixt man and man, which may, if justice hear,
 stand good, that by no benefit confer,
 or purchase make, Europe in chain can hold
 the son of India, and her mine of gold. 
chance lead she there in a accurse hour,
 she see, and make the country she by power;
 nor, draw by virtue love from love of fame,
 shall my rash folly controvert the claim,
 or wish in thought that title overthrow,
 which coincide with, and involve my own. 

Europe discover India first; i find
 my right to Gotham on the self-same ground;
 i first discover it, nor shall that plea
 to she be grant, and deny to i. 
i plead possession, and till one more bold
 shall drive i out, will that possession hold. 
with europe right my kindred right i twine;
 she be the western world, be Gotham Mine.  

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

as on a day, a high and holy day,
 let every instrument of music play,
 ancient and modern; those which draw their birth
 (punctilio lay wide) from pagan earth,
 as well as those by christian make and Jew;
 those know to many, and those know to few;
 those which in whim and frolic light float,
 and those which swell the slow and solemn note;
 those which (while reason stand in wonder by)
 make some complexion laugh, and other cry;
 those which, by some strange faculty of sound,
 can build wall up, and raze they to the ground;
 those which can tear up forest by the root,
 and make brute dance like man, and man like brute;
 those which, while ridicule lead up the dance,
 make clown of Monmouth ape the fop of FRANCE;
 those which, where lady dullness with lord mayor
 prefide, disdain light and trifle air,
 Hallow the feast with psalmody, and those
 which, plant in our church to dispose
 and lift the mind to heaven, be disgrace
 with what a foppish organist call taste. 
all, from the fiddle (on which every fool,
 the pert son of dull sire, discharge from school,
 serve a apprenticeship in college ease,
 and rise through the ganiut to degree)
 to those which (though less common, not less sweet)
 from fame saint Giles, and more fame vine-street,
 (where heaven, the utmost wish of man to grant,
 give i a old house, and a old aunt)
 Thornton, while humour point out the road
 to her arch cub, have hitch into a ode;
 all instrument (attend you listen sphere,
 attend you son of man, and hear with ear)
 all instrument (nor shall they seek one hand
 impress from modern music coxcomb band)
 all instrument, self-acted, at my name
 shall pour forth harmony, and loud proclaim,
 loud but yet sweet, to the accord globe,
 my praise, while gay nature, in a robe,
 a coxcomb doctor robe, to the full sound
 keep time, like Boyce, and the world dance round. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice! 
lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

infancy, strain backward from the breast,
 tetchy and wayward, what he love best
 refuse in his fit, while all the while
 the mother eye the wrangler with a smile,
 and the fond father sit on other side,
 laugh at his mood, and view his spleen with pride,
 shall murmur forth my name, while at his hand
 nurse stand interpreter, through gotham land. 

childhood who, like a April morn, appear,
 sunshine and rain, hope cloud over with fear,
 please and displease by start, in passion warm,
 in reason weak, who, wrought into a storm,
 like to the fretful bully of the deep,
 soon spend his rage, and cry himself asleep,
 who, with a feverish appetite oppress,
 for trifle sigh, but hate they when possess,
 his tremble lash suspend in the air,
 half-bent, and stroke back his long, lank hair,
 shall to his mate look up with eager glee,
 and let his top go down to prate of i. 

youth, who fierce, fickle, insolent, and vain,
 impatient urge on to manhood reign,
 impatient urge on, yet, with a cast
 of dear regard, look back on childhood past,
 in the mid-chase, when the hot blood run high,
 and the quick spirit mount into his eye,
 when pleasure, which he deem his great wealth,
 beat in his heart, and paint his cheek with health,
 when the chase steed tug proud at the rein,
 and, here he start, have run over half the plain,
 when, winge with fear, the stag fly full in view,
 and in full cry the eager hound pursue,
 shall shout my praise to hill which shout again,
 and even the huntsman stop to cry amen. 

manhood, of form erect, who will not bow
 though world shall crack around he; on his brow
 wisdom serene, to passion give law,
 bespeak love, and yet command awe;
 dignity into grace by mildness wrought;
 courage attemper and refine by thought;
 virtue supreme enthrone; within his breast
 the image of his maker deep impress;
 lord of this earth, which tremble at his nod,
 with reason bless, and only less than god;
 manhood, though weep beauty kneel for aid,
 though honour call in danger form array,
 though, clothe with sackcloth, justice in the gate,
 by wicked elder chain, redemption wait,
 manhood shall steal a hour, a little hour,
 (be it not a little one?) to hail my power. 

old-age, a second child, by nature curse
 with more and great evil than the first,
 weak, sickly, full of pain; in every breath
 rail at life, and yet afraid of death;
 put thing off, with sage and solemn air,
 from day to day, without one day to spare;
 without enjoyment, covetous of pelf,
 tiresome to friend, and tiresome to himself,
 his faculty impair, his temper sour,
 his memory of recent thing devour
 even with the act, on his shatter brain
 though the stale register of youth remain;
 from morn to evening babble forth vain praise
 of those rare man, who live in those rare day
 when he, the hero of his tale, be young,
 dull repetition falter on his tongue,
 praise grey hair, sure mark of wisdom sway,
 even while he curse time which make he grey,
 scoff at youth, even while he will afford
 all, but his gold, to have his youth restore,
 shall for a moment, from himself set free,
 lean on his crutch, and pipe forth praise to i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

thing without life shall in this chorus join,
 and, dumb to other 'praise, be loud in i. 

the snowdrop, who, in habit white and plain,
 come on the herald of fair flora train;
 the coxcomb Crocus, flower of simple note,
 who by her side strut in a herald coat;
 the tulip, idle glare to the view,
 who, though no clown, his birth from holland draw,
 who, once full-dressed, fear from his place to stir,
 the fop of flower, the more of a parterre;
 the woodbine, who her elm in marriage meet,
 and bring her dowry in surround sweet;
 the Lilly, silver mistress of the vale,
 the rose of Sharon which perfume the gale;
 the jessamine, with which the queen of flower
 to charm her god adorn his favourite bower,
 which bride, by the plain hand of neatness dress,
 unenvied rival, wear upon their breast,
 sweet as the incense of the morn, and chaste
 as the pure zone, which circle DIAN's waist;
 all flower, of various name, and various form,
 which the sun into strength and beauty warm,
 from the dwarf Daisy, which, like infant, cling,
 and fear to leave the earth from whence it spring,
 to the proud giant of the garden race,
 who, mad rush to the sun embrace,
 overtop her fellow with aspire aim,
 demand his wed love, and bear his name;
 all, one and all, shall in this chorus join,
 and, dumb to other 'praise, be loud in i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

form a gloom, through which to spleen-struck mind
 religion, horror-stamped, a passage find,
 the ivy crawl over the hallow cell,
 where some old hermit wont his bead to tell
 by day, by night; the myrtle evergreen,
 beneath who shade love hold his rite unseen;
 the willow weep over the fatal wave,
 where many a lover find a watery grave;
 the cypress sacred hold, when lover mourn
 their true love snatch away; the laurel wear
 by poet in old time, but destine now
 in grief to wither on a whitehead brow;
 the fig, which, large as what in India grow,
 itself a grove, give our first parent clothes;
 the vine, which, like a blush new-made bride,
 cluster, empurple all the mountain side;
 the yew, which, in the place of sculpture stone,
 mark out the resting-place of man unknown;
 the hedgerow elm, the pine of mountain race;
 the fir, the scotch fir, never out of place;
 the cedar, who top mate the high cloud,
 while his old father Lebanon grow proud
 of such a child, and his vast body lay
 out many a mile, enjoy the filial shade;
 the oak, when live, monarch of the wood;
 the english oak, which, dead, command the flood;
 all, one and all, shall in this chorus join,
 and, dumb to other 'praise, be loud in i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing. 

the shower, which make the young hill, like young lamb,
 bind and rebound, the old hill, like old ram,
 unwieldy, jump for joy; the stream, which glide,
 while plenty march smile by their side,
 and from their bosom rise commerce spring;
 the wind, which rise with heal on their wing,
 before who cleanse breath contagion fly;
 the sun who, travel in eastern sky,
 fresh, full of strength, just rise from his bed,
 though in jove pasture they be bear and breed,
 with voice and whip, can scarce make his steed stir,
 step by step, up the perpendicular;
 who, at the hour of eve, pant for rest,
 roll on amain, and gallop down the west,
 as fast as Jehu, oil for ahab have sin,
 drive for a crown, or post-boy for a inn;
 the moon, who hold over night her silver reign,
 regent of tide, and mistress of the brain,
 who to her son, those son who own her power,
 and do she homage at the midnight hour,
 give madness as a blessing, but dispense
 wisdom to fool, and damn they with their sense;
 the star who, by i know not what strange right,
 preside over mortal in their own despite,
 who without reason govern those, who most
 (how true judge from hence!) of reason boast,
 and, by some mighty magic yet unknown,
 our action guide, yet can guide their own;
 all, one and all, shall in this chorus join,
 and, dumb to other 'praise, be loud in i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

the moment, minute, hour, day, week, month, year,
 morning and eve, as they in turn appear;
 moment and minute which, without a crime,
 can be omit in account of time,
 or, if omit, (proof we may afford)
 worthy by parliament to be restore;
 the hour which, dress by turn in black and white,
 ordain as handmaid, wait on day and night;
 the day, those hour i mean, when light preside,
 and business in a cart with prudence ride;
 the night, those hour i mean with darkness hang,
 when sense speak free, and folly hold her tongue;
 the morn, when nature, rouse from her strife
 with deathlike sleep, awake to second life;
 the eve, when, as unequal to the task,
 she mercy from her foe descend to ask;
 the week, in which six day be kind give
 to think of earth, and one to think of heaven;
 the month, twelve sister, all of different hue,
 though there appear in all a likeness too,
 not such a likeness, as, through hayman work,
 dull mannerist, in christian, Jew, and Turk,
 cloy with a sameness in each female face,
 but a strange something, bear of art and grace,
 which speak they all, to vary and adorn,
 at different time of the same parent bear;
 all, one and all, shall in this chorus join,
 and, dumb to other 'praise, be loud in i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

frore January, leader of the year,
 minc'd-pie in van, and calves-head in the rear;
 dull February, in who leaden reign,
 my mother bear a bard without a brain;
 march various, fierce, and wild, with wind-cracked cheek,
 by wild welchmman lead, and crown with leek! 
April with fool, and may with bastard bless;
 June with white rose on her rebel breast;
 July, to who, the dogstar in her train,
 saint JAMES give oyster, and saint Swithin rain;
 august, who, banish from she Smithfield stand,
 to Chelsea fly, with Dogget in her hand;
 September, when by custom (right divine)
 goose be ordain to bleed at michael shrine,
 while the priest, not so full of grace as wit,
 fall to, unblessed, nor give the saint a bit;
 October, who the cause of freedom join,
 and give a second GEORGE to bless mankind;
 November, who at once to grace our earth,
 saint Andrew boast, and our augusta's birth;
 December, last of month, but best, who give
 a Christ to man, a saviour to the slave,
 while, false grateful, man, at the full feast,
 to do god honour, make himself a beast;
 all, one and all, shall in this chorus join,
 and dumb to other 'praise, be loud in i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

the season as they roll; spring, by her side
 lechery and lent, lay-folly, and church-pride,
 by a rank monk to copulation lead,
 a tub of saint salt-fish on her head;
 summer, in light, transparent gawze array,
 like maid of honour at a masquerade,
 in bawdry gawze, for which our daughter leave
 the fig, more modest, first bring up by eve,
 pant for breath, inflame with lustful fire,
 yet want strength to perfect her desire,
 lean on sloth, who, faint with the heat,
 stop at each step, and slumber on his foot;
 autumn, when nature, who with sorrow feel
 her dread foe winter tread on her heel,
 make up in value what she want in length,
 exert her power, and put forth all her strength,
 bid corn and fruit in full perfection rise,
 corn fair tax, and fruit without excise;
 winter, benumb with cold, no long know
 by robe of fur, since fur become our own,
 a hag who, loathe all, by all be loathe,
 with weekly, daily, hourly libel clothe,
 vile faction at her heel, who, mighty grow,
 will rule the ruler, and foreclose the throne,
 will turn all state-affair into a trade,
 make law one day, the next to be unmake,
 beggar at home a people fear abroad,
 and, force defeat, make they slave by fraud;
 all, one and all, shall in this chorus join,
 and, dumb to other praise, be loud in i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

the year, grand circle, in who ample round
 the season regular and fix be bind,
 (who, in his course repeat over and over,
 see the same thing which he have see before. 
the same star keep their watch, and the same sun
 run in the track where he from first have run;
 the same moon rule the night, tide ebb and flow,
 man be a puppet, and this world a show,
 their old dull folly old dull fool pursue,
 and vice in nothing, but in mode, be new,
 he â€” a lord (now fair befall that pride,
 he live a villain, but a lord he die)
 Dashwood be pious, Berkley fix as fate,
 sandwich (thank heaven) first minister of state,
 and, though by fool despise, by saint unblessed,
 by friend neglect, and by foe oppress,
 scorn the servile art of each court-elf,
 found on honour, Wilkes be still himself)
 the year, encircle with the various train
 which wait, and fill the glory of his reign,
 shall, take up this theme, in chorus join,
 and, dumb to other 'praise, be loud in i. 

rejoice, you happy gothamite, rejoice;
 lift up your voice on high, a mighty voice,
 the voice of gladness, and on every tongue,
 in strain of gratitude, be praise hang,
 the praise of so great and good a king;
 shall Churchill reign, and shall not Gotham sing? 

thus far in sport â€” nor let our critic hence,
 who sell out monthly trash, and call it sense,
 too light of our present labour deem,
 or judge at random of so high a theme;
 high be our theme, and worthy be the man
 to feel the sharp stroke of satire pen;
 but when kind time a proper season bring,
 in serious mood to treat of serious thing,
 then shall they find, disdain idle play,
 that i can be as grave and dull as they. 

thus far in sport â€” nor let half patriot, (those
 who shrink from every blast of power which blow,
 who, with tame cowardice familiar grow,
 will hear my thought, but fear to speak their own,
 who, lest bold truth, to do sage prudence spite,
 shall burst the portal of their lip by night,
 tremble to trust themselves one hour in sleep,)
 condemn our course, and hold our caution cheap. 
when brave occasion bid, for some great end
 when honour call the poet as a friend,
 then shall they find, that, even on danger brink,
 he dare to speak, what they scarce dare to think.
