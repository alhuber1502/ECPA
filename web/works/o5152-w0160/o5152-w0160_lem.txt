epilogue to MARY, queen of Scot. 

design to be speak by mrs. Oldfield. 

by the same.

what can luxurious woman wish for more,
to fix her joy, or to extend her power?
their every wish be in this mary see,
gay, witty, youthful, beauteous, and a queen.
vain useless blessing with ill conduct join!
light as the air, and fleet as the wind.
whatever poet write, and lover vow,
beauty, what poor omnipotence have thou!

queen Bess have wisdom, council, power, and law;
how few espouse a wretched beauty cause!
learn thence, you fair, more solid charm to prize,
contemn the idle flatt'ter of your eye.
the bright object shine but while it be new;
that influence lessen by familiar view.
monarch and beauty rule with equal sway,
all strive to serve, and glory to obey;
alike unpitied when depose they grow —
man mock the idol of their former vow.

two great example have be show today,
to what sure ruin passion do betray;
what long repentance to short joy be due;
when reason rule, what glory do ensue.

if you will love, love like Eliza then;
love for amusement, like those traitor man.
think that the pastime of a leisure hour
she favour oft — but never share her power.

the traveller by desert wolf pursue,
if by his art the savage foe subdue,
the world will still the noble act applaud,
though victory be gain by needful fraud.
such be, my tender sex, our helpless case;
and such the barbarous heart, hide by the beg face.
by passion fire, and not withhold by shame,
they cruel hunter be; we, tremble game.
trust i, dear lady, (for i know they well)
they burn to triumph, and they sigh to tell:
cruel to they that yield, cully to they that sell.
believe i, it be by far the wise course,
superior art shall meet superior force:
hear, but be faithful to your interest still:
secure your heart — then fool with who you will.
