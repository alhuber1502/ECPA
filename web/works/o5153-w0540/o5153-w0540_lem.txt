on a message-card in verse.

send by a lady.

by the same.

Hermes, the gamester of the sky,
to share for once mankind delight,
slip down to earth, exceed sly,
and bid his coachman drive to White.
in form a beau; so light he trip,
you will swear his wing be at his heel;
from glass to glass alert he skip,
and bow and prattle while he deal.
in short, so well his part he play,
the waiter take he for a peer;
and even some great one whisper say
he be no vulgar foreigner.
whatever he be, he sweep the board,
win every bet, and every game;
strip even the rook, who stamp and roar,
and wonder how the devil it come!
he wonder too, and think it hard;
but find at last this great command
be owe to one favourite card,
which still bring luck into his hand.
the four of spade; whenever he see
its sable spot, he laugh at rule,
take odds beyond the game law,
and Hoyle and philidor be fool.
but now, for now it be time to go,
what gratitude shall he express?
and what peculiar boon bestow
upon the cause of his success?
suppose, for something must be do,
on Juno self he can prevail
to pick the pip out, one by one,
and stick they in her peacock tail,
shall Pallas have it, be a doubt,
to twist her silk, or range her pin;
or shall the muse cut it out,
for bridge to their violin.
to Venus shall the prize be give,
superior beauty just reward,
and against the next great rout in heaven
be send she for a message card.
or hold — by Jove, a lucky hit!
your goddess be arrant farce;
go, carry it to mrs. —
and bid she fill it full of verse.
