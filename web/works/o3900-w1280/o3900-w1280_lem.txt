congratulation to a friend, upon believe in Christ.

i 

what morn on thou with sweet ray,
 or bright lustre ever have shine? 
be bless the memorable day
 that give thou Jesus Christ to find! 
give thou to taste his perfect grace,
 from death to life in he to pass! 

ii.

o how diversify the scene,
 since first that heart begin to beat! 
evil and few thy day have be:
 in suffer, and in comfort, great,
 oft have thou groan beneath thy load,
 and sink — into the arm of god! 

iii.

long do all hell its power engage,
 and fill thy darken soul with fear:
 baffle at length the dragon rage,
 at length aton blood appear:
 thy light be come, thy mourning over,
 look up; for thou shall weep no more! 

iv.

bless be the name that set thou free,
 the name that sure salvation bring! 
the sun of righteousness on thou
 have rose with heal in his wing. 
away let grief and sigh flee;
 Jesus have die for thou — for thou! 

v. 

and will he now forsake his own,
 or lose the purchase of his blood? 
no! for he look with pity down,
 he watch over thou for good;
 gracious he eye thou from above,
 and guard and feed thou with his love. 

vi.

since thou be precious in his sight,
 how high favour have thou be! 
upbear by faith to glory height,
 the saviour-god thy eye have see,
 thy heart have feel its sin forgive,
 and taste anticipate heaven. 

vii.

still may his love thy fortress be
 and make thou still his darling care,
 settle, confirm, and establish thou,
 on eagle wing thy spirit bear:
 fill thou with heaven, and ever shed
 his choice blessing on thy head. 

viii.

thus may he comfort thou below,
 thus may he all his grace give:
 he but in part thou here can know:
 yet here by faith submit to live;
 help i to fight my passage through,
 nor seize thy heaven, till i may too. 

ix.

or if the sovereign wise decree
 first number thou among the bless,
 (the only good i will envy thou)
 translate to a early rest;
 near in thy late hour may i
 instruct, and learn of thou, to die. 

x. 

mix with the quire that hover round
 and all the adverse power control,
 angel of peace may i be find
 to animate thy part soul,
 point out the crown, and smooth thy way
 to region of eternal day. 

xi.

fire with the thought, i see thou now
 triumphant meet the king of fear! 
steadfast thy heart, serene thy brow;
 divine confident appear
 thy mount soul, and spread abroad,
 and swell to be dissolve in god. 

xii.

be this the soul so late weigh down
 by care and sin, by grief and pain! 
whither be all thy terror go? 
Jesus for thou the victory gain;
 and death, and sin and Satan yield
 to faith unconquerable shield. 

xiii.

bless be the god, that call thou home;
 faithful to thou his mercy prove:
 through death dark vale he bid thou come,
 and more than conquer in his love;
 robe thou in righteousness divine,
 and make the crown of glory thy!
