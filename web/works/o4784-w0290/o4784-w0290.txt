The EQUIPAGE. 

Written Originally in FRENCH by L'Abb√© Reigner. 

SInce the Road of Life's so ill;
 I, to pass it, use this Skill,
 My frail Carriage driving home
 To its latest Stage, the Tomb. 
Justice first, in Harness strong,
 Marches stedfastly along:
 Charity, to smooth the Pace,
 Fills the next adjoining Trace:
 Independance leads the Way,
 Whom no heavy Curb do's sway;
 Truth an equal Part sustains,
 All indulg'd the loosen'd Reins:
 In the Box sits vig'rous Health,
 Shunning miry Paths of Wealth:
 Gaiety with easy Smiles,
 Ev'ry harsher Step beguiles;
 Whilst of Nature, or of Fate
 Only This I wou'd intreat:
 The Equipage might not decay,
 Till the worn Carriage drops away.
