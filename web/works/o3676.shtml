                     </header>
                     <p>HAVING proposed to write some Pieces on Hu man Life and Manners, such as (to use my
                        Lord <span class="hi">Bacon</span>'s expression) <span class="hi">come home to Men's Busi ness and Bosoms,</span> I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering <span class="hi">Man</span> in the Abstract, his <span class="hi">Nature</span> and his <span class="hi">State</span>: since to prove any moral Duty, to inforce any moral Precept, or to examine the Perfection
                        or Imperfection of any Creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know what <span class="hi">Condition</span> and <span class="hi">Relation</span> it is placed in, and what is the proper <span class="hi">End</span> and <span class="hi">Purpose</span> of its <span class="hi">Being. </span></p>
                     <p>The Science of Human Nature is, like all other Scien ces, reduced to a <span class="hi">few, clear Points</span>: There are not many <span class="hi">certain Truths</span> in this World. It is therefore in the Ana tomy of the Mind as in that of the Body;
                        more Good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and perceptible
                        parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels as will for ever escape
                        our observation. The <span class="hi">Disputes</span> are all upon these last, and I will ven ture<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d9762e1108">[Page]</span> to say, they have less sharpen'd the <span class="hi">Wits</span> than the <span class="hi">Hearts</span> of Men against each other, and have diminished the Practise, more than advanced the
                        Theory, of Mora lity. If I could flatter my self that this Essay has any Merit, it
                        is in steering betwixt Doctrines seemingly op posite, in passing over Terms utterly
                        un-intelligible, and in forming out of all a <span class="hi">temperate</span> yet not <span class="hi">inconsistent,</span> and a <span class="hi">short</span> yet not <span class="hi">imperfect</span> System of Ethics.
                     </p>
                     <p>This I might have done in Prose; but I chose Verse, and even Rhyme, for two reasons.
                        The one will ap pear obvious; that Principles, Maxims, or Precepts so written, both
                        strike the reader more strongly at first, and are more easily retained by him afterwards.
                        The other may seem odd but is true; I found I could ex press them more <span class="hi">shortly</span> this way than in Prose itself, and nothing is more certain than that much of the
                        <span class="hi">Force</span> as well as <span class="hi">Grace</span> of Arguments or Instructions depends on their Conciseness. I was unable to treat
                        this part of my subject more in <span class="hi">detail,</span> without becoming dry and tedious; or more <span class="hi">poetically,</span> without sacrificing Perspi cuity to Ornament, without wandring from the Precision,
                        or breaking the Chain of Reasoning. If any man can unite all these, without diminution
                        of any of them, I freely con fess he will compass a thing above my capacity.
                     </p>
                     <p>What is now published, is only to be considered as a ge neral <span class="hi">Map</span> of <span class="hi">MAN,</span> marking out no more than the <span class="hi">Greater</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d9762e2261">[Page]</span> <span class="hi">Parts,</span> their <span class="hi">Extent,</span> their <span class="hi">Limits,</span> and their <span class="hi">Connection,</span> but leaving the Particular to be more fully delineated in the Charts which are to
                        follow. Consequently, these Epistles in their progress will become less dry, and more
                        susceptible of Poetical Ornament. I am here only opening the <span class="hi">Foun tains,</span> and clearing the passage; To deduce the <span class="hi">Rivers,</span> to follow them in their Course, and to observe their Effects, will be a task more
                        agreeable.
