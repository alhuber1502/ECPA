address to a beech tree, on observe that some of its leaf be tinge by the smoke of a fire that have be kindle under it.

what taint thy shade — or do the year decay? 
yet soon again — thy tender leaf revive. 
i too, in silence, to the grave go down;
 but hope inspire — that still a sweet spring
 await new joy;

sweet than even these field;
 where oft the muse in plaintive note
 invite the come year,
 or mourn the time delay.
