To a Gentleman, who had abus'd Waller.

I grieve to think that Waller's blam'd,
 Waller, so long, so justly, fam'd. 
Then own your Verses writ in Haste,
 Or I shall say, you've lost your Taste. 

Perhaps your loyal Heart disdains
 A Poet, who could take such Pains,
 To tune his sweet, immortal Lays
 To an usurping Tyrant's Praise:
 And, where you hate the Man, I see,
 You never like his Poetry. 
The Truth of this your Verse discovers;
 So you abus'd the Conscious Lovers. 

Tho' in your Principles you glory,
 The Muses are nor Whig nor Tory:
 So from your Sentence they appeal,
 Nor will be judg'd by Party Zeal. 
Whene'er a Poet's to be try'd,
 Let Pope hereafter be your Guide. 
 " Survey the Whole, nor seek slight Faults to find,
 "Where Nature moves, and Rapture warms the Mind.
