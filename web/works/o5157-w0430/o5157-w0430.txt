To Miss ****.

By Miss ELISA CARTER.

I.

THE midnight moon serenely smiles
O'er nature's soft repose,
No lowring cloud obscures the skies,
Nor ruffling tempest blows.

II.

Now every passion sinks to rest,
The throbbing heart lies still,
And varying schemes of life no more
Distract the labouring will.

III.

In silence hush'd, to reason's voice
Attends each mental power;
Come dear Amanda, and enjoy
Reflection's favourite hour.

IV.

Come, while this peaceful scene invites,
Let's search this ample round;
Where shall the lovely fleeting form
Of Happiness be found?

V.

Does it amidst the frolic mirth
Of gay assemblies dwell?
Or hide beneath the solemn gloom
That shades the hermit's cell?

VI.

How oft the laughing brow of joy
A sick'ning heart conceals,
And thro' the cloister's deep recess
Invading sorrow steals.

VII.

In vain thro' beauty, fortune, wit,
The fugitive we trace!
It dwells not in the faithless smile
That brightens Clodio's face.

VIII.

Howe'er our varying notions rove,
All yet agree, in one,
To place its being in some state,
At distance from our own. 

IX.

O blind to each indulgent gift
Of power, supremely wise,
Who fancy happiness in aught
That Providence denies.

X.

Vain is alike the joy we seek,
And vain what we possess,
Unless harmonious reason tunes
The passions into peace.

XI.

To temp'rate bounds, to few desires,
Is happiness confin'd,
And deaf to folly's noise attends
The music of the mind.
