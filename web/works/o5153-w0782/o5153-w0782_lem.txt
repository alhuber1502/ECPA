sonnet xiii.

to the right Hon. mr. â€”, with the forgo sonnet.

thou, who successive in that honour seat
preside, the feud of jar chief to 'suage,
to check the boisterous force of party rage,
raise modest worth, and guide the high debate,

sometime retire from the toil of state,
thou turn the instructive greek or roman page,
or what our british bard of late age
in scarce inferior number can relate:

amid this feast of mind, when fancy child,
sweet Shakespear, rap the soul to virtuous deed,
when SPENSER warble tune his doric lay,
or the first man from paradise exile
great Milton sing, can aught my rustic reed
presume to sound, that may deserve thy praise?
