to the honourable mrs. Eâ€” stretchy.

the artful hand of nature never display
 more skill, then when your charm self be make:
 a shape, a face, and meen so rare, that we
 think you her boast masterpiece to be;
 while that bright soul that heaven have place within,
 make every charm with double-lustre shine:
 but since i on my lyre can touch no string,
 equal to those great merit, i will sing,
 hopeless, to give such mighty charm their due,
 i will leave the world to bright thought of you.
