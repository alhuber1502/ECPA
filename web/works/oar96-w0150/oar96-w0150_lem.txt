upon king William pass the boyn, etc. 

what mighty genius thus excite my breast
 with flame too great to manage or resist;
 and prompt my humble muse at once to sing,
 (unequal task) the hero and the king. 
oh be the potent inspiration less! 
i may find word its rapture to express;
 but now i neither can its force controul,
 nor paint the great idea of my soul:
 even so the priest inspire, leave half the mind
 of the unutterable god behind. 
too soft my voice the hero to express;
 or, like himself, the war-like prince to dress;
 or, speak he act in the dreadful field,
 as brave exploit as e'r the sun behold;
 (secure, and threaten as a martial god,
 among the thick of his foe he ride;
 and, like a angry torrent force his way
 through all the horror that in ambush lie:)
 or at the Boyne describe he as he stand
 resolve, upon the edge of the flood:
 on, on, great William; for no breast but thy,
 be ever urge with such a bold design:
 indulge the motion of this sacred heat;
 for none but thou can wield a thought so great. 
he be launch, he be launch; the foremost from the shore;
 the noble weight that e'r the river bear. 
to smooth their stream, the smile Naides have;
 and, rise, do he homage as he pass:
 and all the shape of death and horror —
 no more — ah stay — though in a cause so good;
 it be pity to expend that sacred blood. 
why will thou thus the bold danger seek,
 and foremost through the hostile squadron break? 
why will thou thus so brave venture all? 
oh, where be unhappy Albion, shall thou fall? 
keep near he still, you kind aethereal power;
 that guard he, and be please, the task be you. 
all the ill fate that threaten he oppose;
 confound the force of his foreign foe,
 and treacherous friend less generous then those;
 may heaven success to all his action give,
 and long, and long, and long, let WILLIAM live:
