ode for music.

i 

descend you nine! descend and sing;
 the breathe instrument inspire,
 wake into voice each silent string,
 and sweep the sound lyre! 
in a sadly-pleasing strain
 let the warble lute complain:
 let the loud trumpet sound,
 till the roof all around
 the shrill echo rebound:
 while in more lengthen note and slow,
 the deep, majestic, solemn organ blow. 
hark! the number, soft and clear,
 gentle steal upon the ear;
 now loud, and yet loud rise,
 and fill with spread sound the sky;
 exult in triumph now swell the bold note,
 in break air, tremble, the wild music float;
 till, by degree, remote and small,
 the strain decay,
 and melt away
 in a die, die fall. 

ii.

by music, mind a equal temper know,
 nor swell too high, nor sink too low. 
if in the breast tumultuous joy arise,
 music her soft, assuasive voice apply;
 or when the soul be press with care
 exalt she in enliven air. 
warrior she fire with animate sound;
 pour balm into the bleed lover wound:
 at music, melancholy lift her head;
 dull Morpheus rouse from his bed;
 sloth from its lethargy awake,
 and listen envy drop her snake;
 intestine war no more our passion wage,
 even giddy faction hear away their rage. 

iii.

but when our country be cause provoke to arm,
 how martial music every bosom warm! 
so when the first bold vessel dare the sea,
 high on the stern the thracian raise his strain,
 while Argo see her kindred tree
 descend from pelion to the main. 
transport demi-god stand round,
 and man grow hero at the sound,
 inflame with glory charm:
 each chief his sevenfold shield display,
 and half unsheathed the shine blade;
 and sea, and rock, and sky rebound
 to arm, to arm, to arm! 

iv.

but when through all the infernal bound
 which flame phlegeton surround,
 sad Orpheus seek his consort lose;
 the inexorable gate be bar,
 and nought be see, and nought be hear
 around the dreary coast,
 but dreadful gleam,
 dismal scream,
 fire that glow,
 shriek of woe,
 sullen moan,
 hollow groan,
 and cry of torture ghost. 
but hark! he strike the golden lyre;
 and see! the torture ghost respire,
 see shady form advance! 
thy stone, o sysiphus, stand still;
 Ixion rest upon his wheel,
 and the pale spectre dance! 
the fury sink upon their iron bed,
 and snake uncurled hang listen round their head. 

v. 

by the stream that ever flow,
 by the fragrant wind that blow
 over the elysian flower,
 by those happy soul who dwell
 in yellow mead of asphodel,
 or amaranthine bower:
 by the hero arm shade
 glitter through the gloomy glade,
 by the youth that die for love,
 wander in the myrtle grove,
 restore, restore Eurydice to life;
 oh take the husband, or return the wife. 
he sing, and hell consent
 to hear the poet prayer;
 stern Proserpine relent,
 and give he back the fair. 
thus song can prevail
 over death and over hell,
 a conquest how hard and how glorious? 
though fate have fast bind she
 with Styx nine time round she,
 yet music and love be victorious. 

vi.

but soon, too soon, the lover turn his eye:
 again she fall, again she die, she die! 
how will thou now the fatal sister move? 
no crime be thy, if it be no crime to love. 
now under hang mountain,
 beside the fall of fountain,
 or where Hebrus wander,
 roll in maeander,
 all alone,
 unheard, unknown,
 he make his moan;
 and call her ghost
 for ever, ever, ever lose! 
now with fury surround,
 despair, confound,
 he tremble, he glow,
 amid rhodope snow:
 see, wild as the wind, over the desert he fly;
 hark! Haemus resound with the bacchanal cry —
 — ah see, he die! 
yet even in death Eurydice he sing,
 Eurydice still tremble on his tongue,
 Eurydice the wood,
 Eurydice the flood,
 Eurydice the rock, and hollow mountain ring. 

vii.

music the fierce grief can charm,
 and fate severe rage disarm:
 music can soften pain to ease,
 and make despair and madness please:
 our joy below it can improve,
 and antedate the bliss above. 
this the divine Cecilia find,
 and to her maker praise confine the sound. 
when the full organ join the tuneful choir,
 the immortal power incline their ear;
 bear on the swell note our soul aspire,
 while solemn air improve the sacred fire;
 and angel lean from heaven to hear! 
of Orpheus now no more let poet tell,
 to bright Cecilia great power be give;
 his number raise a shade from hell,
 she lift the soul to heaven.
