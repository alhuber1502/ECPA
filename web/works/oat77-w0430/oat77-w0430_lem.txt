melancholy.

i 

malignant humour, poyson to my blood!
Bane of those active spirit that glide
and sport within the circle tide,
as fish expire in a infect flood. 
when all the horizon of my soul be clear,
and i suspect no change of weather near,
strait like a sudden storm i find
thy black fume gather in my mind,
transform all t'egyptian darkness there;
darkness where nought occur to sight
but flash, more amaze than the night;
and fiery spectre glide through the trouble air.

ii.

sleep that in other malady bring ease,
feed and enrage this disease;
for when my weary Lidds i close
and slumber, it be without repose. 
this fury still into my dream will creep
to hag my timorous fancy while i sleep;
through charnel house then i be lead,
those gloomy mansion of the dead,
where pensive ghost by their love relic stay,
and curse the approach day.
by merciless foe pursue and take;
oft shipwrecked on the main,
beneath the flood i seem to dive;
oft in wild sarra desert force to engage
some savage monster rage.
oft (typhon-like) beneath a mountain weight i strive!

iii.

may i the book of fate peruse,
to read the lot for i design,
i shall perhaps auspicious find
those planet i accuse;
but while for information i
consult the false astrology
of melancholy fear,
dark and ore-cast my future day appear:
all possible misfortune while i dread,
i draw all possible misfortune on my head;
while this solicitous fear of future ill
my credulous thought employ,
(though false its augury, yet) it destroy
my present rest, and still
divert i from pursuit of certain joy.
who seek for happiness with nice care
must watch its season, and frequent its haunt. 
delight be a rich tender plant
that spring not in all soil, and all the year:
it be like the manna which in plenty lie,
if early seek, around
each hebrew tent, but if till heat of day
their search they do delay.
the ambrosial food be no where to be find.
