the resolve. 

1. 

for what the world admire i will wish no more,
nor court that airy nothing of a name:
such flit shadow let the proud adore,
let they be suppliant for a empty fame.

2. 

if reason rule within, and keep the throne,
while the inferior faculty obey,
and all her law without reluctance own,
account none more fit, more just than they.

3. 

if virtue my free soul unsullied keep,
exempt it from passion and from stain:
if not black guilty thought disturb my sleep,
and no past crime my vex remembrance pain.

4. 

if, though i pleasure find in live here,
i yet can look on death without surprise:
if I have a soul above the reach of fear,
and which will nothing mean or sordid prize.

5. 

a soul, which can be depress by grief,
nor too much raise by the sublime joy;
which can, when trouble, give it self relief,
and to advantage all its thought employ.

6. 

then be i happy in my humble state,
although not crown with glory nor with bay:
a mind, that triumph over vice and fate,
esteem it mean to court the world for praise.
