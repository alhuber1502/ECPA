anacreontic.

gay Bacchus like estcourt wine,
 a noble meal bespeak we;
 and for the guest that be to dine,
 bring Comus, love, and jocus. 

the god near Cupid draw his chair,
 near Comus, jocus place;
 for wine make love forget its care,
 and mirth exalt a feast. 

the more to please the sprightly god,
 each sweet engage grace
 put on some clothes to come abroad,
 and take a waiter place. 

then Cupid name at every glass
 a lady of the sky;
 while Bacchus swear he will drink the lass,
 and have it bumper-high. 

far Comus toss his brimmer over,
 and always get the most;
 jocus take care to fill he more,
 wheneve he mist the toast. 

they call, and drink at every touch;
 he fill, and drink again;
 and if the god can take too much,
 it be say, they do so then. 

gay Bacchus little Cupid sting,
 by reckon his deceit;
 and Cupid mock his stammer tongue,
 with all his stagger gait:

and jocus droll on comus way,
 and tale without a jest;
 while Comus call his witty play
 but waggery at best. 

such talk soon set they all at odds;
 and, have i Homer pen,
 i will sing you, how they drink like god,
 and how they fight, like man. 

to part the fray, the grace fly,
 who make they soon agree;
 nay, have the fury self be nigh,
 they still be three to three. 

Bacchus appease, raise Cupid up,
 and give he back his bow;
 but keep some dart to stir the cup
 where sack and sugar flow. 

jocus take comus rosy crown,
 and gay wear the prize,
 and thrice, in mirth, he push he down,
 as thrice he strive to rise. 

then Cupid seek the myrtle grove,
 where Venus do recline,
 and Venus close embrace love,
 they join to rail at wine. 

and Comus loud curse wit,
 roll off to some retreat,
 where boon companion grave sit
 in fat unwieldy state. 

Bacchus and jocus, still behind,
 for one fresh glass prepare;
 they kiss, and be exceed kind,
 and vow to be sincere. 

but part in time, whoever hear
 this our instructive song;
 for though such friendship may be dear,
 they can continue long.
