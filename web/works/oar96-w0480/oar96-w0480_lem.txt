parthenea,

a elegy.

with sing angel hence she post away,
 as lovely now and excellent as they:
 for one short moment death grim look she bear,
 but never shall see his ghastly visage more. 
release from her dull fetter; as the light,
 active, and pure, Parthenia take her flight;
 and find, at last, the awful secrecy,
 how spirit act, and what they do, and be. 
but now she be swallow in a flood of light,
 and scarce endure the splendour of the sight:
 dear shade, who heaven do so soon remove
 from these cold region to the land of love;
 to endless pleasure, and eternal day;
 how glitter now? how satisfy and gay
 be thou? methinks i do but half lament
 the lovely saint from my embrace rend:
 nor can to those fair mansion cast my eye,
 to which she be flee, and not recall my sigh. 
my grief for she be as unjust, as vain,
 if from that bliss it will hurry she again:
 for though the charm friend on earth i have lose,
 yet she the while may the advantage boast:
 and shall her pure unfettered soul but deign
 a careless glance on these dark coast again,
 it will smile, as conscious, where she leave her chain;
 and smile again at the surprise odds
 of her late dwelling, and those bright abode;
 those bright abode where now, secure bless,
 she sing the anthem of eternal rest.
