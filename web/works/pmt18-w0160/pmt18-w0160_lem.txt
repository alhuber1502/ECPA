write at the eagle nest, Killarney.

July 26, 1800. 

here let we rest, while with meridan blaze
 the sun ride glorious amid the cloudless sky,
 while over the lake no cool zephyr fly,
 but on the liquid glass we dazzle gaze,
 and faint ask for shade: lo! where his nest
 the bird of Jove have fix: the lofty brow,
 with arbutus and fragrant wild shrub dress,
 impendent frown, nor will approach allow:
 here the soft turf invite; here magic sound
 celestial respondent shall enchant,
 while melody from yond steep wood rebound
 in thrill cadence sweet. sure, life can grant
 no bright hour than this; and memory oft
 shall paint this happy scene with pencil soft.
