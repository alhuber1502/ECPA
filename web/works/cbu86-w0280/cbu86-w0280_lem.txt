to the same.

while new-caed kye rout at the stake,
 and powny reek in pleugh or braik,
 this hour on evening edge i take,
 to own i be debtor,
 to honest-hearted, old l*****k,
 for his kind letter. 

forjesket fair, with weary leg,
 rattlin the corn out-owre the rig,
 or deal through among the nag
 their ten-hour bite,
 my awkart Muse sore plead and beg,
 i will not write. 

the tapetless, ramfeezled hizzie,
 she be saft at best and something lazy,
 quo' she, 'you ken we have be so busy
 'this month and more,
' that troth, my head be grow right dizzy,
 'and something fair.' 

her dowf excuse pat i mad;
 'conscience,' say i, 'you thowless jad! 
' i will write, and that a hearty blaud,
 'this vera night;
' so do you affront your trade,
 'but rhyme it right. 

 'shall bald l*****k, the king of heart,
' though mankind be a pack of cart,
 'Roose you so well for your desert,
' in term so friendly,
 'yet you will neglect to shaw your part
' and thank he kind? ' 

sae i get paper in a blink,
 an, down go stumpy in the ink:
 quoth i, 'before i sleep a wink,
' i vow i will close it;
 'and if you will make it clink,
' by Jove i will prose it! ' 

sae I have begin to scrawl, but whether
 in rhyme, or prose, or both thegither,
 or some hotch-potch that be right neither,
 let time make proof;
 but i shall scribble down some blether
 just clean aff-loof. 

my worthy friend, never grudge and carp,
 though fortune use you hard and sharp;
 come, kittle up your moorlan harp
 with gleesome touch! 
never mind how fortune waft and warp;
 she be but a b-tch. 

she be gien metaphor money a jirt and fleg,
 sin i can striddle our all rig;
 but by the l â€” d, though i shall beg
 with lyart pow,
 i will laugh, and sing, and shake my leg,
 as long' i dow! 

now come the sax and twentieth simmer,
 i have see the bud upon the timmer,
 still persecute by the limmer
 from year to year;
 but yet, despite the kittle kimmer,
 i, Rob, be here,

do you envy the city-gent,
 behint a kiss to lie and sklent,
 or purse-proud, big with cent per cent,
 and muckle wame,
 in some bit Brugh to represent
 a baillie name? 

or be it the paughty, feudal thane,
 with ruffle sark and glancin cane,
 who think himself no sheep-shank bane,
 but lordly stalk,
 while cap and bonnet off be take,
 as by he walk? 

 'o thou who give we each guide gift! 
' gie i of wit and sense a lift,
 'then turn i, if thou please, adrift,
' through Scotland wide;
 'with cit nor laird i will shift,
' in all their pride! ' 

be this the charter of our state,
 'on pain of hell be rich and great,'
 damnation then will be our fate,
 beyond remead;
 but, thanks to heaven, that be not the gate
 we learn our creed. 

for thus the royal mandate run,
 when first the human race begin,
 'the social, friendly, honest man,
' whatever he be,
 'it be he fulfil great nature plan,
' and none but he. ' 

o mandate, glorious and divine! 
the follower of the ragged nine,
 poor, thoughtless devil! yet may shine
 in glorious light,
 while sordid son of mammon line
 be dark as night! 

though here they scrape, and squeeze, and growl,
 their worthless nieveful of a soul,
 may in some future carcase howl,
 the forest fright;
 or in some day-detesting owl
 may shun the light. 

then may l*****k and b**** arise,
 to reach their native, kindred sky,
 and sing their pleasure, hope and joy,
 in some mild sphere,
 still close knit in friendship tie
 each pass year!
