sonnet vii.

c**e, with who, my pilot and my guide,
please i have traverse thy sabrina flood,
both where she foam impetuous soil with mud,
and where she peaceful roll her golden tide.

never, o never let ambition pride
(too oft pretext with our country good)
and tinseled pomp, despise when understand,
or thirst of wealth thou from her bank divide.

reflect how calm, like her infant wave,
flow the clear current of a private life;
see the wide public stream by tempest toss,
of every change wind the sport, or slave,
soil with corruption, vex with party strife,
cover with wreck of peace and honour lose.
