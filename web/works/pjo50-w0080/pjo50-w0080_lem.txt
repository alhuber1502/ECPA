matrimony. 

cloe, coquet and debon—,
 haughty, flatter, vain, and — fair;
 no long obstinate — coy,
 let loose her soul to dream of — joy. 
she take the husband to she — arm,
 resign her freedom and her — charm;
 grow tame, and passive to he — will,
 and bid her eye forbear to — kill. 
but mighty happy still at — heart,
 nor room be there for pain, or — smart. 

at length she find the name of — wife
 be but another word for — strife. 
that cheek, which late outblush the — rose,
 now with unwonted fury — glow. 
those tender word, "my dear, i — die,"
 the move tear, and melt — sigh,
 be now exchange for something — new,
 and feign emotion yeild to — true. 
reproach, debate, and loss of — fame,
 intrigue, disease, dun, and — shame. 
no single fault he strive to — hide;
 madam have virtue, therefore — pride. 
thus both resent, while neither — spare,
 and curse, but can break their — snare.
