SONNET [38] XXXVIII. From the Novel of Emmeline. 

WHEN welcome slumber sets my spirit free,
 Forth to fictitious happiness it flies,
 And where Elysian bow'rs of bliss arise
 I seem, my Emmeline — to meet with thee! 
Ah! Fancy then, dissolving human ties,
 Gives me the wishes of my soul to see;
 Tears of fond pity fill thy soften'd eyes;
 In heav'nly harmony — our hearts agree. 
Alas! these joys are mine in dreams alone,
 When cruel Reason abdicates her throne! 
Her harsh return condemns me to complain
 Thro' life unpitied, unreliev'd, unknown. 
And as the dear delusions leave my brain,
 She bids the truth recur — with aggravated pain.
