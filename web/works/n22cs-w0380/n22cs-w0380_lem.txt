sonnet [38] xxxviii. from the novel of Emmeline. 

when welcome slumber set my spirit free,
 forth to fictitious happiness it fly,
 and where elysian bower of bliss arise
 i seem, my Emmeline — to meet with thou! 
ah! fancy then, dissolve human tie,
 give i the wish of my soul to see;
 tear of fond pity fill thy soften eye;
 in heavenly harmony — our heart agree. 
alas! these joy be i in dream alone,
 when cruel reason abdicate her throne! 
her harsh return condemn i to complain
 through life unpitied, unrelieved, unknown. 
and as the dear delusion leave my brain,
 she bid the truth recur — with aggravate pain.
