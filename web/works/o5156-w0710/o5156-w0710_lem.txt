hymn to miss Laurence, in the pump-room.

bath, 1753. 

naiad of this healthful stream,
fair Laurentia, if i deem
right of thy office here,
if the theme may please thy ear,
listen gracious to my lay,
while the spring of health i praise:
nor will less thy glory shine,
if their praise i blend with thy.
for of their renown of old
story many fame have tell:
ancient bard their name have sing
hero, king, and god among,
and with various title grace,
while their fountain-head they trace.
whether Bladud, king of yore,
skill in philosophic lore,
mingle various kind of earth,
metallic, give the water birth,
king's-bath name, beneath thy foot
Boiling ay with mineral heat:
or, whether from his car on high
Phoebus see with amorous eye
the fountain-nymph, with humid train,
light of foot, trip over the plain;
strait the god, inflame with love,
swift descend from above,
all in fervour bright array
press her bosom; and the maid
glad to his warm embrace
yield: whence the happy place,
where the nymph he woo and win,
be call the water of the sun.
fame that title wide spread;
yet, ere roman legion flee
the wrath of sturdy british knight,
Pallas claim religious right;
british Palladour then rise,
from the goddess name, who choose
near the favourite stream to dwell,
guardian of the sacred well.

but long since hygeia fair
under her peculiar care
receive the spring; for well she know
each salubrious rill that flow
forth from subterranean vault,
store by nature hand with salt,
steel, or sulphur: for her use
nature open every sluice,
which hygeia give in charge
to several nymph: herself at large
roam over hill, and dale, and plain,
lackey by a duteous train;
oread, naiad, dryad pay
service glad: some smoothe her way,
or mist disperse, or brush the tree;
other waft the morning-breeze
from mountain-top: down the hill
other pour refresh rill,
or bathe her limb in fountain neat,
aid, all, her influence sweet.
she with smile eye survey
rustic labour, and convey
strength to the active thresher arm,
to village-maiden beauty charm.

happy be the son of earth
who the goddess at their birth
shine on. yet, her heavenly ray
number, not respect, stray
from her presence, and pursue
luxury path, who sordid crew,
lust inordinate, and sloth,
and gluttony unwieldy growth,
lead they on to shame, and pain,
and malady, a endless train.
oft with pang distract tear
they hygeia absence mourn;
bitter change! their languid eye
feel not joy in sunny sky;
nor do night, with slumber bless,
close they at the hour of rest.
and oft with sigh, and tear, and prayer
half-suppressed by sad despair,
they the queen of health implore
her wish presence to restore.

nor unmindful of their woe
be the goddess; for i choose
thou, Laurentia, lovely maid
among thy sister nymph, who play
on the bank of Avon, thou,
bright-eyed nymph, she choose to be
her substitute, and power she give
sovereign over the heal wave
which thou rule with gentle sway.
thou the smoke tide obey
joyous; and at thy command
wash thy rosy-fingered hand;
thence in crystal cup convey
yield their salutary aid
to all, who thou with look benign
smile on round hygeia shrine;
all of appetite deprave,
those who pale-eyed spleen enslave,
cripples bend with gouty pain,
who jaundice tinge with muddy stain,
or who frame of nerve, with stroke
benumb, tremulous palsy break.
these the balmy, cordial stream
quaff, rejoice; thou, their theme
of praise, extol; thy tender care,
thy soft address, and courteous air:
and while harmony, the friend
of health, delight to recommend
thy ministry, thy charm inspire
love and joy, and gay desire:
for the goddess, when she give
rule imperial over the wave,
to adorn the gift, and grace thy state,
on thou bid youth and beauty wait.

nor do thou not taste delight
where thou sit in duteous plight;
for the joy, thy hand bestow,
back to thou redound flow,
when the cheek of fade hue,
thou see display rose new.
thou suspend crutch please,
signal trophy from disease
win to health victorious. hail,
comfort, and support of frail
human state! hail, bloom maid!
nymph belove! without thy aid,
he, who, greeting thou, his lay
now attune to note of praise,
mute have be, oppress with pain
of spasm rheumatic. hail again,
priestess of hygeia shrine!
still dispense her gift divine,
still her votary lead to health;
else, what profit Marlborough wealth,
 Eliza form, and stanhope wit,
and all the eloquence of Pitt?
