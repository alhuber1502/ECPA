the peasant in search of his heifer.

a tale, after m.  de la fontaine. 

it so befall: a silly Swain
have seek his heifer long in vain;
for wanton she have frisk stray,
and leave the lawn, to seek the shade.
around the plain he roll his eye,
then, to the wood, in haste he hie;
where, single out the fair tree,
he climb, in hope to hear or see.

anon, there chance that way to pass
a jolly lad and buxom lass:
the place be apt, the pastime pleasant;
occasion with her forelock present:
the girl agog, the gallant ready;
so light down he lay my lady.
but so she turn, or so be say,
that she some certain charm display,
which with such wonder strike his sight,
(with wonder, much; more, with delight)
that loud he cry in rapture, what!
what see i, god! what see i not!
but nothing name; from whence it be guess,
it be more than well can be express.

the clown aloft, who lend a ear,
strait stop he short in mid career:
and loud cry, ho! honest friend,
that of thy see see no end;
do see the heifer that i seek?
if do, pray be so kind to speak.
