a ode on aeolus's harp. 

by the same.

i 

aetherial race, inhabitant of air!
who hymn your god amid the secret grove;
you unseen being to my harp repair,
and raise majestic strain, or melt in love.

ii.

those tender note, how kind they upbraid?
with what soft woe they thrill the lover heart?
sure from the hand of some unhappy maid
who die of love, these sweet complain part.

iii.

but hark! that strain be of a grave tone,
on the deep string his hand some hermit throw;
or he the sacred bard! who sit alone,
in the drear waste, and weep his people woe.

iv.

such be the song which zion child sing,
when by euphrates stream they make their plaint:
and to such sad solemn note be string
angelic harp, to sooth a die saint.

v. 

methinks i hear the full celestial choir,
through heaven high dome their awful anthem raise;
now chant clear, and now they all conspire
to swell the lofty hymn, from praise to praise.

vi.

let i, you wander spirit of the wind,
who as wild fancy prompt you touch the string,
smite with your theme, be in your chorus join,
for until you cease, my muse forget to sing.
