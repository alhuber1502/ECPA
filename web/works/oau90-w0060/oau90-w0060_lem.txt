a parallel.

in old italian prose, we read,
a youth by riot and fond love undo,
have yet a falcon leave of famous breed,
his chief diversion in his fatal need,
and sole companion when he leave the town.
the saint that do his soul possess,
touch with a generous sense of his distress
make he a visit at his poor retreat,
who his heart noble feast, but, alas,
his empty purse can get,
nothing be good enough for she to eat:
till rack with shame, and a long fruitless search,
he more to make his love appear,
his darling hawk snatch from the perch,
and dress it for his dear,
which generous act do so entire gain she,
she give he all her love and wealth,
and noble pay her entertainer.
so when my love with fate at strife
have spend its whole estate,
and nature short-winged hawk my life
be doom a dish for fate;
divine Olympia change the sad decree,
and with infallible divinity,
give a new be to my soul and i.
