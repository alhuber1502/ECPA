on a screen, work in flower by her royal highness ANNE, princess of orange.

illustrious nymph! who art can raise
 this skilful monument of praise,
 forgive the bard, who strike the lyre;
 accept the verse, your toil inspire:
 for, when your labour strike my eye,
 the voluntary number rise. 
who can be silent, when they view
 this fair creation, wrought by you? 
each flower do with such lustre shine,
 such beauty crown the gay design;
 that nature fix in wonder stand,
 to see she be rival by your hand;
 and, jealous of your art, display
 a blush, when she the work survey. 
yet this accomplish piece, we find,
 show a faint image of your mind;
 the lovely charm, and grace here,
 but copy those, that centre there.
