to ruin.

i 

all hail! inexorable lord! 
at who destruction-breathing word,
 the mighty empire fall! 
thy cruel, woe-delighted train,
 the minister of grief and pain,
 a sullen welcome, all! 
with stern-resolved, despair eye,
 i see each aim dart;
 for one have cut my dear tie,
 and quiver in my heart. 
then lower, and pour,
 the storm no more i dread;
 though thicken, and blacken,
 round my devote head. 

ii.

and thou grim power, by life abhor,
 while life a pleasure can afford,
 oh! hear a wretch prayer! 
no more i shrink appal, afraid;
 i court, i beg thy friendly aid,
 to close this scene of care! 
when shall my soul, in silent peace,
 resign life joyless day? 
my weary heart it be throb cease,
 cold-mouldering in the clay? 
no fear more, no tear more,
 to stain my lifeless face,
 enclasped, and grasp,
 within thy cold embrace!
