the lass of the hill.

humble inscribe to her grace the Dutchess of Marlborough.

i 

on the brow of a hill a young shepherdess dwell,
 who no pang of ambition or love have ever feel:
 for a few sober maxim still run in her head,
 that'twas better to earn, ere she eat her brown bread:
 that to rise with the lark be conducive to health,
 and, to folk in a cottage, contentment be wealth. 

ii.

now young Roger, who live in the valley below,
 who at church and at market be reckon a beau;
 have many time try over her heart to prevail,
 and will rest on his pitchfork to tell she his tale:
 with his win behaviour he melt her heart;
 but, quite artless herself, she suspect no art. 

iii.

he have sigh and protest, have kneel and implore,
 and can lie with the grandeur and air of a lord:
 then her eye he commend in language well dress,
 and enlarge on the torment that trouble his breast;
 until his sigh and his tear have so wrought on her mind '
that in downright compassion to love she incline. 

iv.

but as soon as he will melt the ice of her breast,
 all the flame of his love in a moment decreast;
 and at noon he go flaunt all over the vale,
 where he boast of his conquest to Susan and Nell:
 though he see she but seldom, he be always in haste,
 and if ever he mention she, make she his jest. 

v. 

all the day she go sigh, and hang her head,
 and her thought be so pester, she scarce earn her bread;
 the whole village cry shame when a milk she go,
 that so little affection be show to the cow:
 but she heed not their rail, even let they rail on,
 and a fig for the cow, now her sweetheart be go. 

vi.

now beware, you young virgin of britain gay isle,
 how you yield up your heart to a look and a smile:
 for Cupid be artful, and virgin be frail,
 and you will find a false Roger in every vale,
 who to court you, and tempt you will try all his skill;
 but remember the lass on the brow of the hill.
