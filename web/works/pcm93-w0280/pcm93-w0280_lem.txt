send with some poem.

to thou, dear partner of my fate,
 this poetry i consecrate;
 nor will thy friendly heart refuse
 the tribute of a artless muse,
 who strain can never condescend
 on vice or folly to attend;
 can never vanity inflate,
 or offer incense to the great;
 in which no line do ever appear
 but as thy candid breast sincere. 
if they in aught have merit show,
 that merit thou may call thy own â€”
 since thou do oft my thought engage
 attentive over the classic page,
 while listen to the magic lie
 whole day unheeded pass away;
 since it be to please thy partial mind
 my pen to poetry incline. 
and if the trifle shall have power
 thou to amuse one vacant hour,
 let other to loud fame aspire,
 thy praise be all that i desire.
