to mr. Parkhouse, of Tiverton, Devon. 

accept, dear parent! from a filial pen,
 the humble offer of my pensive muse:
 she paint on my mind a daughter woe,
 nor can my heart the tender theme refuse. 

the rightful patron of eventful tale,
 to you i dedicate the scene she draw;
 my soul she search to find osmida thought,
 and colour she from what i feel for you. 

you then the meed — if meed kind fame will grant,
 the tale to you — to you the bay belong;
 you give my youthful fancy wing to soar;
 from your indulgence flow my wild-note song. 

its music in your ear will sweet sound;
 its page, with fond delight, you will traverse over:
 with half your pleasure may the world peruse! 
my muse, my vanity can ask no more. 

dear other parent! guiltless hold my heart,
 though unadorned my number with your name;
 your worth, your goodness, in its centre live,
 and there shall perish only with my frame.
