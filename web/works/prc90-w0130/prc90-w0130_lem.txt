the star of Eden vale

why stand the tear in jessie eye? 
why do Maria weep and wail? 
with grief they scarce can reply,
 "we have lose the star of Eden vale." 

for he all nature seem to mourn;
 we hear a voice in every gale;
 he never, never will return,
 the lovely star of Eden vale. 

in yonder grove a maiden lie,
 ah! she can tell thou such a tale! 
look not, Maria, with surprise,
 dim be the star of Eden vale. 

but why shall i this tale relate,
 or what can sigh or tear avail? 
curse on a rival ruthless hate,
 fall be the star of Eden vale. 

but i will forbear to tell her name,
 for that will turn Maria pale;
 yet never be she hear to blame,
 but bless the star of Eden vale. 

with languid look, at close of day,
 she walk alone by hill and dale;
 and oft i have hear she sigh say,
 the sun be set in Eden vale.
