[song from the opera of ELPIDIA.]

thus translate. 

such radiant eye who can withstand,
 that even in sleep charm? 
or who resist the soft command,
 since through their shade they warm? 

insensible how much they shine,
 as ah! how much i grieve;
 i greedy gaze, you sleep supine,
 nor know the wound you give.
