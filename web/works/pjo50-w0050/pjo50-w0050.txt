[SONG from the Opera of ELPIDIA.]

Thus translated. 

Such radiant eyes who can withstand,
 That ev'n in sleeping charm? 
Or who resist the soft command,
 Since thro' their shades they warm? 

Insensible how much they shine,
 As ah! how much I grieve;
 I greedy gaze, you sleep supine,
 Nor know the wounds you give.
