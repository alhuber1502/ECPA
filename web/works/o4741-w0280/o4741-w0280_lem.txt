to the reverend dr. friend, on his quit Westminster school.

if void of art my languid verse appear,
 forgive, o friend, the bard, who sing in tear:
 rude be the lay, which only grief adorn;
 and dull the muse, when Apollo mourn;
 when science tremble over minerva shrine,
 to see her favourite priest his charge resign. 
yet why shall grief debase his glorious name,
 or blast the bay, his merit just claim? 
no venal view his noble temper sway;
 he quit with honour, what he keep with praise. 
as some wise leader, in successful war,
 wear out with age, and cover over with scar,
 resign the post, he brave long sustain,
 crown with the palm, his former valour gain:
 so thou, paternal sage! may now repose;
 nor seek new laurel, to adorn thy brow;
 review thy toil, and see what polish peer
 honour thy form hand, and studious care:
 let learned cart'ret, elegant of taste,
 confess the mould, in which his mind be cast:
 let hervey muse her tutor worth proclaim,
 and pelham royal trust declare thy fame;
 Pelham, in who capacious soul we find
 the scholar, statesman, and the patriot join. 
nor shall the tender plant, which round thou stand,
 ever prove ungrateful to the planter hand;
 water by thou, their well-fixed root extend,
 their branch flourish, and the fruit ascend;
 while please hope with expectation smile,
 to reap the future product of thy toil,
 intent to see thy pupil shine forth,
 who action soon shall better speak thy worth;
 when in the train of senator they come,
 refine with all the art of Greece and Rome;
 while, in each act, their prudent counsel show
 their master loyalty, and learning too. 
thus have thy precept make thy province shine,
 and even minerva Athens yield to thy.
