An Extempore Invitation TO THE EARL of OXFORD, Lord High Treasurer.

1712.

Our Weekly Friends To-morrow meet
 At Matthew's Palace, in Duke-street;
 To try for once, if They can Dine
 On Bacon-Ham, and Mutton-chine:
 If weary'd with the great Affairs,
 Which Britain trusts to Harley's Cares,
 Thou, humble Statesman, may'st descend,
 Thy Mind one Moment to unbend;
 To see Thy Servant from his Soul
 Crown with Thy Health the sprightly Bowl:
 Among the Guests, which e'er my House
 Receiv'd, it never can produce
 Of Honor a more glorious Proof â€”
 Tho' Dorset us'd to bless the Roof.
