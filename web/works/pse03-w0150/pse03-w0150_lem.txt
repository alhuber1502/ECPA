to orabella, marry to a old Man. 

tell i fair nymph who just have design,
 a charm youth to suit your equal mind;
 what do seduce you thus to match with one,
 who if by nature make she will scarce own? 
for form so many century ago,
 she have forget if he be her work or no;
 i think the way to do his reverence right,
 be to suppose he a Pre-Adamite:
 your bloom youth his age beyond decay,
 will teach censorious malice what to say,
 who spite of virtue will your fame betray. 
what strong persuasion make you thus to wed,
 with such a carcass scandalise your bed? 
sure it be no earthly gain that charm you to it,
 nothing but hope of heaven shall make i do it:
 but since there be other way to gain that bliss,
 dispatch martyrdom i will not miss;
 to be secure, can i but escape from this. 
the monster twin who brother grow from his side,
 with all the stench he suffer when he die,
 be a just emblem of so yok a bride. 
but phthisic, gout and palsy have their charm,
 and do entice you to his tremble arm:
 kind amorous glance from his hollow eye,
 do your gay breast with rapturous joy surprise
 ah! who can blame to see a yield maid,
 by all these bloom charm to love betray. 
oh! for a vestal coldness to resist
 the tempt softness in such beauty dress. 
the bright idea soon dissolve in air,
 and in it be room the picture of despair. 
a move skeleton he seem to be,
 nature ancient anatomy. 
worth observation, hang he up therefore
 in Gresham college, and i will ask no more.
