a bard epitaph.

be there a whim-inspired fool,
 our fast for thought, our hot for rule,
 our blate to seek, our proud to snool,
 let he draw near;
 and over this grassy heap sing dool,
 and drap a tear. 

be there a bard of rustic song,
 who, noteless, steal the croud among,
 that weekly this area throng,
 o, pass not by! 
but with a frater-feeling strong,
 here, heave a sigh. 

be there a man who judgement clear,
 can other teach the course to steer,
 yet run, himself, life mad career,
 wild as the wave,
 here pause — and through the start tear,
 survey this grave. 

the poor inhabitant below
 be quick to learn and wise to know,
 and keen feel the friendly glow,
 and soft flame;
 but thoughtless folly lay he low,
 and stain his name! 

reader attend — whether thy soul
 soar fancy flight beyond the pole,
 or darkling grub this earthly hole,
 in low pursuit,
 know, prudent, cautious, self-control
 be wisdom root.
