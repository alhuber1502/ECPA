sonnet.

when glow Phoebus quit the weep earth,
 what splendid vision rise upon the sight! 
fancy, with transient charm and colour bright,
 to change form in heaven gay scene give birth:
 but soon the melt beauty disappear,
 and fade like those which in life early bloom
 hope bid i prize; and the approach gloom,
 these tint of sadness, and these shade of fear,
 resemble most that melancholy hour
 which, with a silent and resistless power,
 shroud my joy bright beam in shadowy night:
 till memory mark each scene which once shine gay;
 as the dark plain, beneath the moon soft light,
 again reveal, reflect a mellow ray.
