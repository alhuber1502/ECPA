Isa. li. 9 , etc. 

i 

arm of the lord awake, awake! 
thy own immortal strength put on. 
with terror clothe the nation shake,
 and cast thy foe, in fury, down. 
as in the ancient day appear! 
the sacred annal speak thy fame:
 be now omnipotent near,
 through endless age still the same. 

ii.

thy tenfold vengeance know to quell,
 and humble haughty rahab pride. 
groan her pale son thy stroke to feel,
 the firstborn victim groan and die! 
the wound dragon rage in vain;
 while bold thy utmost plague to brave,
 mad he dare the part main
 and sink beneath the of rewhelm wave. 

iii.

he sink; while israel choose race
 triumphant urge their wondrous way. 
divine lead the favourite pass,
 the unwatry deep, and empty sea. 
at distance heap on either hand,
 yield a strange unbeaten road,
 in crystal wall the water stand,
 and own the arm of israel god! 

iv.

that arm which be not shorten now,
 which want not now the power to save. 
still present with thy people thou
 bear they through life dispart wave. 
by earth and hell pursue in vain,
 to thou the ransom seed shall come;
 shout their heavenly Sion gain,
 and pass through death triumphant home. 

v. 

the pain of life shall there be over,
 the anguish and distract care;
 there sigh grief shall weep no more,
 and sin shall never enter there! 
where pure, essential joy be find
 the lord redeem their head shall raise,
 with everlasting gladness crown,
 and fill with love, and lose in praise!
