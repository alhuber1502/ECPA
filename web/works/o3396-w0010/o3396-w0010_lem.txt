ode: in honour of the nuptial of their royal highness the prince and princess of Wales.

recitative, accompany.

descend, and consecrate, you sacred nine,
 the nuptial rite of GEORGE and Caroline:
 nor court, nor invoke, but wing your way,
 yourself inspire, my mighty theme to obey!

and first, sweet polyhimnia, muse of sound,
 verb'rate thy lyre; and, while thou spread around,
 tremble Aether sweet fill,
 thy rapturous air so soft, so thrill,

possess i, rule each sense at thy control;
 strain follow strain,
 again, and yet again:
 come, with thy melody entrance my longing soul.

air,

in glide measure charm to thou
 the playful nymph Terpsichore,
 with ease, and grace, and look askance:
 her pant bosom burn,
 as, twine, twist, turn,
 in win guise, she lead the mazy dance.

now soft and soothe be thy strain,
 to ease the fond erato pain,
 whisper, that in her realm, no more
 false, fickle love shall she deplore;
 bid she behold, with glad surprise,
 her mistress in love tender art,

a princess come, to bless our isle,
 who form shall captivate all eye,
 and who example fix all heart.
bid she the tremble tear to dry,
 to dissipate the deep-heaved sigh,
 to smooth her lower brow, and smile.

and join, accompany by thou,
 the playful nymph Terpsichore,
 with ease, and grace, and look askance;
 her pant bosom burn,
 as twist, twine, turn,
 in win guise, she lead the mazy dance.

recitative, accompany.

now change the strain, and to thy spell
 mighty Calliope compel —
 display ample history page —
 bid she Urania bring; a virgin, and a sage:
 who, skill in science' wondrous lore,
 can sun, and world, and heaven explore:
 and — a triumvirate to fill —
 bid Clio, her celestial skill,
 to aid the glorious purpose, join.
and, while the trumpet silver note proclaim
 so great, so mighty, so august a name;
 bid they transmit to fame
 those truth divine,
 that speak the glory of the Brunswick line.

but hark! upon the ear what rustic strain
 cleave the free air? it be gay euterpe train,
 that sylvan, faun, and hamadriade, lead,
 with horn, and flageolet, and oaten reed!

air.

and first the horn, who mellow sound,
 wake echo in the hollow rock,
 to inspire the fleet, sagacious hound
 where to unearth the subtle fox.

the flageolet shall imitate
 the feather songster, by his mate,
 sequester in the conscious grove,
 impervious to all eye but love.

and now, as the lorn nightingale
 mourn, sad, in the pensive vale,
 day labour at a end,
 rustic the wind dance shall lead,
 to the cadence of euterpe reed,
 and mirth with sadness blend.

air.

and thou, Melpomene, appear,
 who woe find no relief,
 who mind be best joy the social tear,
 who luxury be grief:

behold she! — dim each sorrow eye —
 but let the torrent flow!
be hallow that sweet sympathy
 that mourn for other' woe.

air.

nor thou, Thalia, gay and trim,
 skulk, where behind thy mask thou be peep,
 come forth, with frolic wit and whim,
 rouse sluggard dullness, as he be sleep.

with honest gibe, and moral jeer,
 and humour, honour cause adorn;
 come, dissipate thy sister tear,
 as cheer the sun a April morning.

say, as her grief thou bid she dry,
 each passion virtue in its season,
 that, as it be folly loud to cry,
 so, laugh loud be sometime reason.

recitative, accompany.

begone! disperse like air!
to blue Olympus fly!
there,
 place on high,
 as the celestial, in their roseate bower,
 play with the smile, and count the dance hour,
 strike the loud sphere!
your voice raise,
 and charm their capture ear
 proclaim Caroline unequalled praise.
her wisdom bid Minerva fear;
 bid she, who young Endymion embrace,
 blush, and resign the name of chaste;
 tell lovely Venus and the dimple grace
 to yield to truth, and own,
 all sweet, all beautiful, as be their face.
her face perfection boast alone.
all, all, while sit in celestial state,
 that which they can equal, bid they wonder at:
 and, as your mandate they attend,
 and from the silver cloud astonish bend,
 bid they behold, with a benignant smile,
 the rapture that pervade great britain happy isle.

march.

fire with my theme, thus give i nature law;
 will at a wish, and what i fancy see.

air.

i see the god, in troop attend,
 well please, from high Olympus bend!
while playful neriedes gay give
 the splendid yatch to neptune wave:

i hear old Jove by Styx declare
 he never see mortal half so fair;
 while Juno own he will never know strife,
 can she, like she, have prove a wife;
 Minerva say, proud to extol she,
 she will always be her aptest scholar;
 again her mirror and again
 Venus regard, but in vain;
 then rub the surface, it be not right,
 at last she break it out of spite.
one call for nectar, "go and sip,"
 cry Hebe, "nectar from her lip;"
 Mars, proud, say, he see a race
 of future hero in her face;
while rough-hew Neptune, smile, swear
never have his billow bear before
a lovely Venus to a happy shore.

recitative, accompany.

and true Neptune swear; scarce smile the fair,
 to thank old ocean for his anxious care,
 but troop of bard burst forth in one fond lay —
 for light be light, and day we still call day —
 and, as the obvious truth fall from each tongue,
 by each proud heart inspire, they feel and sing.

air.

hail lovely wonder, honour meed,
 rule every heart that virtue prize,
 eclipse each fair, as star recede,
 when from old ocean Venus rise.

haste, haste, with sacred love and truth,
 grace smile Hymen bless communion;
 haste and reward the only youth
 who virtue merit such a union.

ii.

see picture in her face her mind,
 beauty and goodness never asunder;
 while envy, now, no long blind,
 grow kindness, and subside to wonder!

rose bloom beneath her foot,
 cupid for a smile implore she,
 while zephyr steal a kiss so sweet,
 it perfume all the way before she.

recitative, accompany.

mute admiration, that have hush the crowd,
 yield to acclamation warm and loud;
 for lo! a sight that ever shall impart
 strong, strong emotion to each british heart!
scarce have the princess, on the people strand,
 admire the beauty of fair freedom land,
 when, in majestic grandeur, stand reveal,
 bright as her crest, refulgent as her shield,
 Britannia! — with a tender zeal impress,
 as tutelary guardian of her lovely guest:
 and oh! ineffable be the angelic smile
 that bid the glorious stranger welcome to her isle.
nor end there
 those shout that rend the air;
 but as distinction, honour, on the way,
 still court some solicitous delay,
 their long eye pursue the splendid train,
 nor lose they till they reach fair Hymen fane,
who they address in fervent prayer.

air.

sacred HYMEN, on this night,
 thy torch with fire celestial light;
 and, in thy smile crown of flower,
 symbol this pair delicious hour.

let Flora rose the wreath adorn,
 deprive of each intrude thorn;
 let the fond heliotrope be there;
 and Venus' myrtle fresh and fair:

Mars, for his laurel, next invoke,
 and blend it with the civic oak;
 so bliss, fame, constancy, shall prove
 their lot bestow by thou and love.

recitative accompany.

here let i pause, you power, or let i claim.
than inspiration, some superior name;
 give i to speak the force of every grace,
 perfection ever bestow on form or face,
 with all the gift concentr in the mind,
 when god their essence blend with humankind;
 so my strong zeal shall disappoint despair,
 so shall i sing the worth of this illustrious pair.

air.

so shall i paint, in conflict tender,
 as fear and joy alternate strive,
 that form that bid her heart surrender,
 while burn blush speak her love.

not Sol, that Belvidere delight,
 nor yet alcides of farnese;
 a form more perfect, that unite
 superior strength, with noble ease.

ii.

so shall i paint that manly beauty,
 that worth, to truth and virtue dear,
 that mildness, honour, goodness, duty,
 all heart admire, all mind revere.

these, as his portrait faint charm she,
 win her consent to be a wife;
 now love promethean ardour warm she,
 and breathe the picture into life.

recitative, accompany.

nor shall my glow mind its ardour cease,
 till, as i paint their happiness increase,
 in will number, no less warm than true,
 i lay futurity to open view:
 and, while a people join in loud acclaim,
 tell to the universe the prophecy of fame.

air.

long on this isle, the solar ray,
 benignant eye of favour heaven,
 shall beam, to consecrate the day,
 that see a Brunswick to a Brunswick give.
swell every voice, beat every heart,
 all in the general bliss bear part;
 while the loud trumpet note proclaim
 fate fiat, by the mouth of fame.

 "in other state, while rule and power
"that strut the pageant of a hour,
 "treason destroy, and time absorb,
"like circle planet in their orb:
 "here shall a happy people joy
"revolve in one just equipoise,
 "while time and virtue shall endure,
"their honour safe, their right secure.
 "confirm to this bless race alone,
"England hereditary throne."
