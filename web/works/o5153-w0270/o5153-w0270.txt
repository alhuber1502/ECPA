To the same with a New Watch. 

WITH me while present, may thy lovely eyes
Be never turn'd upon this golden toy:
Think ev'ry pleasing hour too swiftly flies,
And measure time, by joy succeeding joy.

But when the cares that interrupt our bliss
To me not always will thy sight allow,
Then oft with kind impatience look on this,
Then every minute count â€” as I do now.
