to the same with a new watch. 

with i while present, may thy lovely eye
be never turn upon this golden toy:
think every please hour too swift fly,
and measure time, by joy succeed joy.

but when the care that interrupt our bliss
to i not always will thy sight allow,
then oft with kind impatience look on this,
then every minute count â€” as i do now.
