song ii

thyrsis, when we part, swear
ere the spring he will return.
ah, what mean yond violet flower,
and the bud that deck the thorn?
it be the lark that upward spring!
it be the nightingale that sing!

idle note, untimely green,
why such unavailing haste?
western gale and sky serene
prove not always winter past.
cease my doubt, my fear to move;
spare the honour of my love.
