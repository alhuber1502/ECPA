a inscription for the monument of Diana countess of Oxford and Elgin.

who from a race of noble hero come,
 and add lustre to its ancient fame:
 round her the virtue of the cecil shine,
 but with inferior brightness to her own;
 which she refine to that sublime degree,
 the great mortal can not great be. 
each stage of life peculiar splendour have;
 her tender year with innocence be clad,
 maturer grow, whatever be brave and good
 in the retinue of her virtue stand:
 and at the final period of her breath,
 she crown her life with a propitious death;
 that no occasion may be want here
 to make her virtue fame, or joy sincere. 
two noble lord her genial bed possess,
 a wife to both, the dear, and the best. 
Oxford submit in one year to fate,
 for who her passion be exceed great. 
to Elgin, full six lustra be assign,
 and he she love with so intense a mind,
 that live, like a father she obey,
 die, as to a son, leave all she have. 
when a step-mother, she soon soar above
 the common height, even of maternal love. 
she do she numerous family command
 with such a tender care, so wise a hand,
 she seem no otherwise a mistress there
 than god-like soul in human body be. 
but when to all she have example show,
 how to be great, and humble, chaste and good,
 her soul for earth too excellent, too high,
 fly to its peer, the prince of the sky.
