to a mouse,

on turn she up in her nest with the plough, November, 1785. 

we, sleeket, covuran, timorous beastie,
 o, what a panic in thy breastie! 
thou need not start away so hasty,
 with bicker brattle! 
i will have be laith to rin and chase thou,
 with murder battle! 

i be true sorry man dominion
 have break nature social union,
 and justify that ill opinion,
 which make thou startle,
 at i, thy poor, earth-born companion,
 and fellow-mortal! 

i doubt not, whiles, but thou may thieve;
 what then? poor beastie, thou must live! 
a daimen-ick in a threave
 be a small request:
 i will get a blessing with the lave,
 and never miss! 

thy wee-bit housie, too, in ruin! 
it be silly wall the win be strewin! 
and nothing, now, to big a new one,
 of foggage green! 
and bleak December wind ensuin,
 baith snell and keen! 

thou see the field lay bare and waste,
 and weary winter come fast,
 and cosy here, beneath the blast,
 thou thought to dwell,
 till crash! the cruel coulter past
 out through thy cell. 

that wee-bit heap of leaf and stibble,
 have cost thou money a weary nibble! 
now thou' turn out, for all thy trouble,
 but house or hold,
 to thole the winter sleety dribble,
 and cranreuch cauld! 

but Mousie, thou be no thy-lane,
 in prove foresight may be vain:
 the best lay scheme of mouse and man,
 go aft agley,
 and lea'e we nought but grief and pain,
 for promise joy! 

still, thou be bless, compare with i! 
the present only touch thou:
 but och! i backward cast my e'e,
 on prospect drear! 
and forward, though i can see,
 i guess and fear!
