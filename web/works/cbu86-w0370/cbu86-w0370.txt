ANOTHER.

One Queen Artemisa, as old stories tell,
 When depriv'd of her husband she loved so well,
 In respect for the love and affection he'd show'd her,
 She reduc'd him to dust, and she drank up the Powder. 

But Queen N**********, of a diff'rent complexion,
 When call'd on to order the fun'ral direction,
 Would have eat her dead lord, on a slender pretence,
 Not to show her respect, but â€” to save the expence.
