hymn to the holy ghost.

i 

come holy ghost, all-quickening fire,
 come, and in i delight to rest! 
draw by the lure of strong desire,
 o come, and consecrate my breast:
 the temple of my soul prepare,
 and six thy sacred presence there! 

ii.

if now thy influence i feel,
 if now in thou begin to live;
 still to my heart thyself reveal,
 give i thyself, for ever give. 
a point my good, a drop my store:
 eager i ask, and pant for more. 

iii.

eager for thou i ask and pant,
 so strong the principle divine
 carry i out with sweet constraint,
 till all my hallow soul be thy:
 plunge in the godhead deep sea,
 and lose in thy immensity. 

iv.

my peace, my life, my comfort now,
 my treasure, and my all thou be! 
true witness of my sonship thou,
 engrave pardon on my heart:
 seal of my sin in Christ forgive,
 earnest of love, and pledge of heaven. 

v. 

come then, my god, mark out thy heir,
 of heaven a large earnest give,
 with clear light thy witness bear;
 more sensible within i live:
 let all my power thy entrance feel,
 and deep stamp thyself the seal. 

vi.

come, holy ghost, all quicken fire,
 come, and in i delight to rest! 
draw by the lure of strong desire,
 o come, and consecrate my breast:
 the temple of my soul prepare,
 and fix thy sacred presence there!
