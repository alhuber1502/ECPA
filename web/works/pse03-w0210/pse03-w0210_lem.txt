on the death of dear Statyra. 

begone my muse, tear quench thy sacred fire,
 true grief, like love, without thou can inspire. 
moderate sorrow may be tell with art,
 but the distraction of my trouble heart
 with sad confusion i must needs express,
 my verse will, like my sigh, be numberless. 
ah, cruel death! why be it thou so severe,
 to take the young, the witty, and the fair,
 the gay satyra in her bloom day:
 can no less feast serve thy luxurious jaw? 
will not the old or discontent do? 
those who misfortune force to wish for you. 
no those i by experience find you fly;
 and it be not those we will, but those you please, must dy. 
guide i, some friend, if i have any one,
 who grief have spare since dear statyra go:
 lead i, i say, to some sad cyprise shade,
 dark as the grave of the once lovely maid;
 there let i ever mourn the friend i have lose:
 you god, why be Statyra make a ghost? 
i can no more gaze on that charm face,
 hear that sweet voice, nor have one dear embrace;
 view that soft air and mien, and sport and play,
 as we be wont on summer-bank each day. 
you pleasant walk who she so oft do grace,
 who be charm do dart a glory round the place. 
keep on your dismal hue, let not the spring
 put on your fresh attire, nor summer bring. 
the less gay verdant look you bird be still,
 sound not one note unless sad philomel. 
each lofty tree hang down your stately head,
 but forth no more now gay statyra dead;
 but let your naked bough be ever join
 in murmur sorrow with the sigh wind:
 no blow, no wind to move the yield bough,
 my loud sigh will do that office now. 
keep back your force you spring that grace the wood,
 my tear alone will swell you into flood:
 and all too little for the friend i grieve,
 now she be go it be not worth while to live.
