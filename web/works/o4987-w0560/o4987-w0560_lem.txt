a morning soliloquy on deafness.

by â€”.

nature! thy genial call i hear,
 which wake the morn and i,
 and seem to strike upon my ear,
 though deaf to all but thou:
 to i the hour in silence roll away;
 no music greet the dawn, or mourn the close of day. 

to i the skylark, poise aloft,
 in silence seem to play,
 and hail no more in warble soft
 the rise dawn of day;
 for i in vain they swell their liquid throat,
 contemplative i muse, nor hear the jocund note. 

to i the shepherd pipe in vain,
 in vain the milkmaid sing;
 lose be the bleat of the plain,
 the gurgle of the spring;
 no more i hear the nightingale complain,
 when to the moon she chant her sad love-laboured strain. 

and when with i Lucinda stray
 along the breezy grove,
 in transport on her charm i gaze,
 and think she talk of love:
 ah! cease, dear maid, to talk of love in vain,
 for smile alone to i the voice of love explain. 

Pygmalion thus, when he survey
 the work his hand have form,
 enamour wish to see the maid
 with mutual passion warm,
 and as he woo his ear he oft incline,
 while yet no voice of love relieve his anxious mind. 

cease thy complaint (methinks even now
 the voice of reason cry)
 dispel the gloom that cloud thy brow,
 suppress the heave sigh:
 what fate decree it be folly to bewail;
 weigh then the good and ill in wisdom equal scale. 

no more in friendship thin disguise
 shall flattery soothe thy ear,
 experience kindness make thou wise,
 to know thy friend sincere;
 no more shall thou attend to faction cry,
 the taunt of jealous pride, or envy blast lie. 

no more shall now thy mind be toss
 by every breath of praise;
 no more thy reason shall be lose
 in controversy maze;
 thou safe through life sequester vale shall go,
 and learn from nature work her wise decree to know.
