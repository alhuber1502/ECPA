the mid-night think.

now that the twinkle star essay
a faint resemblance of the day,
show fair now for be beset
with night (like diamond in jet)
let i repose within this grove,
the solemn season there improve.
restless alas! from sun to sun,
a round of business i have run:
while other sleep project lay,
yet since i thought how many a day!
how long since i do meditate
of life, of death, and future state?
approach fate his pace will keep,
let mortal watch, or let they sleep.
what sound be that? â€” a pass bell!
then to eternity farewell!
poor soul, thou be at thy crisis now,
and one short hour thy doom shall show,
eternal bliss, or endless woe!
if virtue lore thou have despise,
how will that virtue now be prize!
or say, thou do in our loose age,
on her forsake side engage,
will thou the dear remembrance now,
for the world monarchy forgo?
what other medicine can thou find
assuage the favour in thy mind?
now waken conscience speak at large,
and envious fiend inhance the charge!
let the bold atheist now draw near,
thy chill and droop spirit to cheer;
his brisk wine and Witt to thou
will now alike insipid be! 
where be the lawless hectring brave
that from the arrest of death can save?
Wh' attempt a rescue here, will fail,
and this grim sergeant take not Bail.
