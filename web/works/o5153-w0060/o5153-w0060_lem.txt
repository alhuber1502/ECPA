verse to be write under a picture of mr. Poyntz.

by the same.

such be thy form, o Poyntz! but who shall find
a hand, or colour, to express thy mind?
a mind unmoved by every vulgar fear,
in a false world that dare to be sincere;
wise without art; without ambition great;
though firm, yet pliant; active, though sedate;
with all the rich store of learning fraught,
yet better still by native prudence teach;
that, fond the grief of the distress to heal,
can pity frailty it can never feel;
that, when misfortune sue, never seek to know
what sect, what party, whether friend or foe;
that, fix on equal virtue temperate law,
despise calumny, and shun applause;
that, to its own perfection single blind,
will for another think this praise design.
