VERSES to be written under a Picture of Mr. POYNTZ.

By the Same.

SUCH is thy form, O Poyntz! but who shall find
A hand, or colours, to express thy mind?
A mind unmov'd by ev'ry vulgar fear,
In a false world that dares to be sincere;
Wise without art; without ambition great;
Tho' firm, yet pliant; active, tho' sedate;
With all the richest stores of Learning fraught,
Yet better still by native Prudence taught;
That, fond the griefs of the distress'd to heal,
Can pity frailties it could never feel;
That, when Misfortune su'd, ne'er sought to know
What sect, what party, whether friend or foe;
That, fix'd on equal Virtue's temp'rate laws,
Despises calumny, and shuns applause;
That, to its own perfections singly blind,
Would for another think this praise design'd.
