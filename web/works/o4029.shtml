From the beginning of my literary warfare, these unmerciful Wits have pursued me with the sharpest arrows of Criticism; and I have had nothing to console me, alas! — but the approbation of the Public. How shall I escape now, when to all my other faults are added, so many outrages in Geography? With what triumph of critical sagacity will they say, (after the necessary strictures on the story, thoughts, and verses) <span class="q"> "If our Author was determined to send her Pegasus into <span class="hi">Spain,</span> in quest of adventures, she ought to have consulted <span class="hi">Salmon</span> about the situation of its provinces. She would there have found that <span class="hi">Arragon</span> is fifty miles from the sea; and that the <span class="hi">Moors</span> could not possibly have debarked on its confines, unless, like fish to the <span class="hi">London</span> markets, their fleet had arrived by land-carriage. With equal facility, the troops of the King of <span class="hi">Leon</span> are brought across <span class="hi">Old Castile</span> to <span class="hi">Saragossa</span> in about thirty hours — another miracle; which was doubtless accomplished by the interposition of a friendly necromancer, who furnished the army with wings, in exchange for some chaste damsel, or beautifull princess. Had this Lady-Writer's reading extended to a <span class="hi">translation</span> of the Iliad, she would have found no examples of such liberties there. <span class="hi">Homer</span> gives an exact map of the countries he carries us through; and from <span class="hi">Ithaca</span> to <span class="hi">Troy,</span> not a village or river is misplaced."</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d8602e2532">[Page]</span><p>True: but <span class="hi">Homer</span> (I name him as a modern Painter mentions a <span class="hi">Correggio,</span> and a <span class="hi">Raphael</span>) <span class="hi">Homer</span> united the Historian with the Poet — I deal entirely in fiction. It was enough for me, that <span class="hi">Spain,</span> through a succession of ages, had been subject to the ravages of <span class="hi">Africa;</span> and that during this period, sovereigns had been robbed of their crowns, and been obliged to resign their sceptres to their swarthy conquerors. The relation of the particular events of these remote times, the Historic Muse has generally left to her creative Sister, who never fails to profit by their obscurity, in relating them to the world in her own manner; the geography of the heart, and the history of the passions, are the only realities to which she attends. If, in describing <span class="hi">these,</span> I shall be found deviating from the laws of Truth, and Nature, I shall have failed in my intention; but I protest, if the <span class="hi">cacoethes scribendi</span> should continue on me, or if I should ever wander again into the regions of Romance, I shall treat oceans and provinces with as little ceremony as rivulets and meadows: I will avail myself of the established privileges, and raise mountains, seas, or kingdoms, in any part of the habitable globe that hits my fancy; or, if it strikes me, build a temple to Dullness — in the chamber of a Reviewer.</p></section></div><li id="o4029-w0010" style="text-indent:0;"><a href="/works/o4029-w0010.shtml"><em>THE MAID OF ARRAGON.</em></a></li><li><a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-5">addenda</a></li><div class="collapse" id="collapse-5"><section class="addenda" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d8602e57143">[Page]</span></section></div><li id="o4029-w0020" style="text-indent:0;"><a href="/works/o4029-w0020.shtml"><em>LINES IN IMITATION OF COWLEY.</em></a></li><li id="o4029-w0030" style="text-indent:0;"><a href="/works/o4029-w0030.shtml"><em>A MONOLOGUE.</em></a></li></ul></div></div></div></section><script xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" type="text/javascript">
