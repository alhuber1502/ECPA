[translation from Statius, Thebaid ix 319-26]

Crenaeus, who the nymph Ismenis bear
to Faunus on the theban river shore,
with new-born heat amid his native stream
exult in arm, which cast a iron gleam.
in this clear wave he first behold the day;
on the green bank first teach his step to stray,
to skim the parent flood and on the margin play:
fear he disdain and scorn the power of fate,
secure within his mother watery state.
the youth exult stem the bloody tide,
visit each bank and stalk with martial pride,
while old ismenus gently-rolling wave
delight the favourite youth within its flood to lave.
whether the youth oblique steer his course
or cut the downward stream with equal force,
the indulgent river strive his step to aid.
