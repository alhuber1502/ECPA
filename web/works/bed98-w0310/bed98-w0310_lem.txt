my last visit to w — y c — g, on the sickness of mrs. w — y. 

scene long belove! for ever dear!
if aught of music in my tongue,
your beauty through the vary year,
have tune my sweet song.
when infant spring bring bud flower,
and summer sit in perfume bower,
in autumn change face,
the snow that crown yond mountain brow,
and storm that stir the wave below,
give but sublime grace.

here oft my harmless childhood play,
trace the bright insect on its wing;
through these wild scene delight stray,
with innocence and spring.
my youthful heart will oft employ,
bright hope to dress my future joy,
as here it sport round;
smile with i in my walk along,
cheere i in nature artless song,
and in yond cot be find.

the stranger home! the traveller rest
where want can never long complain,
the tale there melt pity breast,
the rich have hear in vain.
ah spring! that nature call to live,
can thou her fade form revive,
who can for misery feel,
who rich alone in bounty power,
will spread around her little store,
and share her simple meal.

there oft the infant brood i bring,
rescue from savage plunderer hand,
till plume, by native instinct teach,
they join the tuneful band.
farewell! thou hospitable dome!
my frequent and my happy home,
no more in thou to dwell;
no more this fragrant air to breathe,
or sleep this friendly roof beneath,
ah! can i say — farewell!
