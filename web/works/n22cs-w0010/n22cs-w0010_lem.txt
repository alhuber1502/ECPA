sonnet [01] i 

the partial muse have, from my early hour,
 smile on the rugged path i be doom to tread,
 and still with sportive hand have snatch wild flower,
 to weave fantastic garland for my head:
 but far, far happy be the lot of those
 who never learn her dear delusive art;
 which, while it deck the head with many a rose,
 reserve the thorn, to fester in the heart. 
for still she bid soft pity melt eye
 stream over the ill she know not to remove,
 point every pang, and deepen every sigh
 of mourn friendship, or unhappy love. 
ah! then, how dear the muse favour cost,
 if those paint sorrow best â€” who feel it most.
