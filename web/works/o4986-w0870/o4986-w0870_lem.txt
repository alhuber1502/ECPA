sonnet.

to a lady of indiscreet virtue.

in imitation of SPENSER.

by to Pâ€”.

while you, fair ANNA, innocent gay,
 and free and open, all reserve disdain;
 whereve fancy lead secure stray,
 and conscious of no ill can fear no stain;

let calm discretion guide with steady rein,
 let early caution twitch your gentle ear;
 she will tell you censure lay her wily train,
 to blast those beauty which too bright appear. 

ah i! i see the monster lurk near,
 i know her haggard eye, and poisonous tongue,
 she scan your action with malicious leer,
 eager to wrest and represent they wrong;
 yet shall your conduct, circumspect and clear,
 nor baleful touch, nor fang envenom fear.
