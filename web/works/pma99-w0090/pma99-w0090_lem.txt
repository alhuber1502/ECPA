on the human heart.

say, for you know, you secret spring
 which guide the human heart,
 whence come it that such trivial thing
 give mine so keen a smart? 

i, which have know such real woe,
 such real ill have bear;
 if have stand such weighty blow,
 why by a touch overthrow? 

thus have i see the sturdy oak,
 which hardly deign to bow
 when the storm rage, by the stroke
 of the sharp axe lay low. 

the bark, which wind and wave have brave
 on many a hostile coast,
 at length from foreign danger save,
 in it be own port be lose. 

if from a friend a word i hear,
 or meet a look unkind,
 why from my eye descend the tear,
 and why this torture mind? 

and why will those we love thus give
 these small, though deadly, sting? 
how fain will i not grief receive
 but what from nature spring! 

those sorrow may i learn to bear,
 and humble kiss the rod,
 through faith and hope cast off despair,
 and give my soul to god.
