by the same.

Stella and Flavia every hour
do various heart surprise;
in stella soul lie all her power,
and flavia in her eye.

more boundless flavia conquest be,
and stella more confine;
all can discern a face that be fair,
but few a lovely mind.

Stella, like britain monarch, reign
over cultivate land;
like eastern tyrant Flavia deign
to rule over barren sand.

then boast not, Flavia, thy fair face,
thy beauty only store;
thy charm will every day decrease,
each day give Stella more.
