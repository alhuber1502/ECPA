TO CHLORIS: A SONG.

I.

CHloris, for fear you should think to deceive me,
Know all my Life I have studied your kind,
Learn'd in your Grammar, I'd have you believe me,
And all your Tricks in my Practice you'll find;
Ogling and Glances,
Sighs and Advances,
Poor Country Cully no more shall ensnare:
Pantings and Tremblings,
Fits and Dissemblings,
Now you must leave, and Intrigue on the Square.

II.

Give me the Girl that's good natur'd and Witty,
Whose pleasant Talk can her Friend entertain,
One who's not Proud, if you tell her she's Pretty;
And yet enough to be Honest and Clean.
Pox on Town Cheatings,
Jilts and Cognettings;
I my Dear Chloris, will bring up by hand:
Tears and Complainings,
Breed but Disdainings,
Those still Love best that are under Command.
