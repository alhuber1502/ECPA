a extemporary acrostic.

my muse, once more, thy aid i humble claim;
 refuse not now to grace my rustic lay. 
Johnston or pope may well befit the theme
 or grecian bard, who ever merit praise. 
how dare my humble hand assume so high? 
no common character inspire my song,
 his grow fame long since have reach the sky:
 all i can say but do his virtue wrong;
 let then my blunder pen in silence rest;
 lo, silent admiration paint they best.
