song i 

a general song of praise to god.

i 

how glorious be our heavenly king,
 who reign above the sky! 
how shall a child presume to sing
 his dreadful majesty? 

ii.

how great his power be, none can tell,
 nor think how large his grace;
 not man below, nor saint that dwell
 on high before his face. 

iii.

not angel that stand round the lord,
 can search his secret will;
 but they perform his heavenly word,
 and sing his praise still. 

iv.

then let i join this holy train,
 and my first offering bring;
 the eternal god will not disdain
 to hear a infant sing. 

v. 

my heart resolve, my tongue obey,
 and angel shall rejoice,
 to hear their mighty maker praise
 sound from a feeble voice.
