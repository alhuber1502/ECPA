SONG XXIV.

The Child's Complaint.

I.

WHY should I love my Sports so well,
 So constant at my Play,
 And lose the Thoughts of Heav'n and Hell;
 And then forget to pray? 

II.

What do I read my Bible for,
 But, LORD, to learn thy Will;
 And shall I daily know thee more,
 And less obey thee still? 

III.

How senseless is my Heart and wild! 
How vain are all my Thoughts? 
Pity the Weakness of a Child,
 And pardon all my Faults. 

IV.

Make me thy heav'nly Voice to hear,
 And let me love to pray;
 Since GOD will lend a gracious Ear
 To what a Child can say.
