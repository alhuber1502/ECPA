song xxiv.

the child complaint.

i 

why shall i love my sport so well,
 so constant at my play,
 and lose the thought of heaven and hell;
 and then forget to pray? 

ii.

what do i read my bible for,
 but, lord, to learn thy will;
 and shall i daily know thou more,
 and less obey thou still? 

iii.

how senseless be my heart and wild! 
how vain be all my thought? 
pity the weakness of a child,
 and pardon all my fault. 

iv.

make i thy heavenly voice to hear,
 and let i love to pray;
 since god will lend a gracious ear
 to what a child can say.
