advice to a friend, design to publish his poem.

reclaim, rash friend, your wild resolve to engage
a captious, and ill-natured age.
it be not enough the verse you write be good,
to take, it must be understand. 
and to instruct the world, where you excel,
be hard much than write well. 
th'are different task to write well, and to please;
the last (alas!) a work of ease. 
while Midas Umpire sit; let none admire
Pan pipe prefer to phebus lyre. 
the gawdy painting take the vulgar sight,
while artful piece less delight.
in vain be nature represent well,
if it it be not gay, it will never sell.
hark in your ear (it be a strange mystery,
but a grand truth), if popular you will be,
faith spare your pain, and write extempore.
