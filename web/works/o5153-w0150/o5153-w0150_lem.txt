song.

write in the year 1732. 

by the same.

i 

say, Myra, why be gentle love
a stranger to that mind,
which pity and esteem can move;
which can be just and kind?

ii.

be it because you fear to share
the ill that love molest:
the jealous doubt, the tender care,
that rack the amorous breast?

iii.

alas! by some degree of woe
we every bliss must gain:
the heart can never a transport know,
that never feel a pain.
