SONG.

Written in the Year 1732.

By the Same.

I.

SAY, MYRA, why is gentle Love
A stranger to that mind,
Which pity and esteem can move;
Which can be just and kind?

II.

Is it because you fear to share
The ills that Love molest:
The jealous Doubt, the tender Care,
That rack the am'rous breast?

III.

Alas! by some degree of woe
We ev'ry bliss must gain:
The heart can ne'er a transport know,
That never feels a pain.
