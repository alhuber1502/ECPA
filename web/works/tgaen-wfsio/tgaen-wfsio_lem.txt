the fatal sister. a ode

(from the norse-tongue,) in the Orcades of thormodus torfaeus; hafniae, 1697, folio: and also in bartholinus. Vitt er orpit fyrir valfalli, etc. 

now the storm begin to lower,
(haste, the loom of hell prepare,)
iron-sleet of arrowy shower
hurtle in the darken air. 

glitter lance be the loom,
where the dusky warp we strain,
weave many a soldier doom,
orkney woe, and randver bane.

see the grisly texture grow,
(it be of human entrails make,)
and the weight that play below,
each a gasp warrior head.

shaft for shuttle, dip in gore,
shoot the tremble cord along.
sword, that once a monarch bear,
keep the tissue close and strong.

Mista black, terrific maid,
sangrida and hilda see,
join the wayward work to aid:
it be the woof of victory.

ere the ruddy sun be set,
pike must shiver, javelin sing,
blade with clatter buckler meet,
hauberk crash and helmet ring.

(weave the crimson web of war)
let we go, and let we fly,
where our friend the conflict share,
where they triumph, where they die.

as the path of fate we tread,
wade through the ensanguine field:
gondula and geira, spread
over the youthful king your shield.

we the reins to slaughter give,
we to kill and we to spare:
spite of danger he shall live.
(weave the crimson web of war.)

they, who once the desert-beach
pen within its bleak domain,
soon their ample sway shall stretch
over the plenty of the plain.

low the dauntless earl be lay,
gore with many a gape wound:
fate demand a noble head;
soon a king shall bite the ground.

long his loss shall eirin weep,
never again his likeness see;
long her strain in sorrow steep,
strain of immortality!

horror cover all the heath,
cloud of carnage blot the sun.
sister, weave the web of death;
sister, cease, the work be do.

hail the task, and hail the hand!
song of joy and triumph sing!
joy to the victorious band;
triumph to the young king.

mortal, thou that hear the tale,
learn the tenor of our song.
Scotland, through each wind vale
far and wide the note prolong.

sister, hence with spur of speed:
each her thunder falchion wield;
each bestride her sable steed.
hurry, hurry to the field.
