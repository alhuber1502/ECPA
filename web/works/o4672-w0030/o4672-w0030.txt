GOD Appears most Glorious IN OUR Salvation by CHRIST.

I.

FAther, how wide thy Glory shines! 
How high thy Wonders rise! 
Known thro' the Earth by thousand Signs,
 By thousand thro' the Skies. 

II.

Those mighty Orbs proclaim thy Power,
 Their Motions speak thy Skill;
 And on the Wings of every Hour
 We read thy Patience still. 

III.

Part of thy Name Divinely stands
 On all thy Creatures writ;
 They show the Labour of thine Hands,
 Or Impress of thy Feet. 

IV.

But when We view thy Strange Design
 To save Rebellious Worms,
 Where Vengeance and Compassion joyn
 In their Divinest Forms:

V.

Our Thoughts are lost in Reverend Awe,
 We Love and we Adore;
 The tallest Angel never saw
 So much of God before. 

VI.

Here the whole Deity is known,
 Nor dares a Creature guess
 Which of the Glories brightest shone,
 The Justice or the Grace. 

VII.

When we transgress'd the Fathers Laws,
 The dying Son atones;
 Oh the Dear Mysteries of his Cross! 
The Triumph of his Groans! 

VIII.

Now the full Glories of the Lamb
 Adorn the Heavenly Plains;
 And the Young Cherubs learn his Name,
 And try their choicest Strains. 

IX.

O may I bear some humble Part
 In that Immortal Song;
 Wonder and Joy shall tune my Heart,
 And Love command my Tongue.
