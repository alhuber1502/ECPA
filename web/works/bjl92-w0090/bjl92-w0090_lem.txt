the month love. 

you maiden attend to my tale,
 of love that sly archer take care;
 his dart over all rank do prevail,
 the wealthy, the wise, and the fair. 

when once his fierce arrow he throw,
 contentment will bid you adieu;
 no potion the doctor bestow,
 can then be of service to you. 

experience prompt i to tell,
 i feel his tyrannical sway;
 the time i remember too well;
 it be a long month and a day. 

the youth, i will not mention his name,
 who be the sole cause of my smart,
 his deed be unnoticed by fame,
 his manner unpolished by art. 

his person can boast of no charm,
 his word of no conquer power;
 yet his footstep do give the alarm,
 which make my heart beat for a hour. 

when absent from he i adore,
 one minute as age do prove;
 though plenty replenish my board,
 i fast and feast on love. 

my couch but augment my pain;
 no sleep ever close my eye;
 one glance of my rustic young swain
 be what i more high do prize,

none ever bemoan my sad case;
 they laugh at the ill i endure;
 but time do my sorrow efface,
 and spite of the imp i be cure. 

i see my love youth in the shade,
 soft whisper to Susan apart;
 resentment come quick to my aid;
 and i banish he quite from my heart. 

but be not too forward, you fair,
 nor take too much courage from i,
 how many have fall in the snare
 that get not so easy free?
