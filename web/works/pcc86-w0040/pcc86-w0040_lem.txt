on see lady H— after the death of a favourite daughter.

not death so common, or a infant lose,
 the turn of mind by tender feeling tost;
 deep by regret each happy scene reflect,
 for she my life all other joy neglect. 
blow there a rose so sweet? each flower recall —
 a day how gay, then droop its head and fall. 
bleak winter come! the lifeless tree no shade,
 a dreary night; how cold, how change a bed! 
how then to sleep, to peace, my mind compose! 
at once deprive for ever of repose. 
what have i do? to blast my early hope,
 tear thus my life, the cause of my hard lot? 
oh! awful thought, to question thy decree! 
prostrate to earth, my spirit fly to thou;
 the mystic dove in cloud ascend above,
 come, little child, come, and share my love. 
around her couch in innocence descend,
 thy guardian wing to comfort and defend. 
resign her mind, in slumber quiet impart
 thy heavenly scene to raise again her heart. 
but how these scene, these joy, conceive below? 
for aught in earth will i these scene forgo,
 already bless, yet want one blessing more,
 when we shall meet, and you these scene explore.
