the farewell to affection.

go, soft sensation, once so dear,
 so long the much-loved ruler here;
 go, go, and leave this bosom free,
 and take thy many a pang with thou;
 thy fear, that die of dread ill;
 thy soft grief that slow kill;
 thy anguish for another woe;
 thy mingle tear, that silent flow;
 thy sigh, that linger oft on air,
 and melt the soft zephyr there;
 thy little jealousy, that prove
 thy pride of heart, but most thy love;
 that tenderness of soul, which know
 a endless world of fancy woe;
 a thousand slight, a thousand pain,
 that pierce at once the bleed vein;
 the feeling quick, that faint and start,
 and haste their tremor to the heart;
 with all the nameless fear that mourn
 a love bestow without return! 

go, go; indifference shall be i,
 that own another soul than thy;
 a cool composure gild her day,
 and smooth waft her hour away;
 no fancy ill her joy molest,
 in peaceful shade her feeling rest:
 there her own poppy breathe around,
 there bloom the rose that can wound. 
no thorn that shed the dewy tear,
 or plant of feeling wander near;
 or blossom with her purple vein,
 or little fibre know pain;
 for there soft slumber choose her bower,
 and woo her soporific flower,
 which gentle lull the power of sleep,
 or cool the eye of those that weep;
 over all the sense shed a charm,
 and lock the mind from dread of harm:
 be thou my guest, indifference fair,
 of bloom cheek, and tranquil air;
 of mien unaltered, look the same,
 careless alike of praise or blame; —
 thou who no change of season know,
 no sudden gust of wintery woe,
 no blast that rend the bosom flower,
 no cloud that stream in endless shower. 
thy blissful poppy still retain
 the balsam-juice in all her vein;
 in all her vein the essence flow
 that bend the eyelid to their close;
 and though her fringe head shall droop,
 as if from grief she will catch the stoop,
 still into morpheus cup she will pour
 the drop of many a precious shower. 

yet stay, affection; ever we part,
 for thou have long live in my heart,
 let i relate how oft i have find
 in thy soft voice the soft sound,
 as if sweet harmony draw near
 and pour her soul into my ear. 
persuasion come, with tuneful chord,
 and draw a tone from weak word;
 even weak word her note can prove,
 when wrap in music sweet move
 in concert with her smile or sigh,
 or the full language of her eye;
 that silent pathos who can bear,
 or speak the thought that tremble there! 
it be then illusion ready hand
 now glaze the water, deck the land;
 around the scene enchantment throw,
 and turn to pearl the simple dew;
 touch every flower with magic charm,
 and keep the bosom sweet warm. 
the eye over all Elysium roll —
 it be stream of silver, rock of gold —
 and walk of happiness be see
 among vocal bower, and valley green. 
but, sweet deceiver! now it be over,
 i look through thy soft eye no more;
 no more, since sure thy pain be give
 to draw we from a fancy heaven,
 to tell we that all bliss below
 be tinge with many a shade of woe. 

and who can say, enchant power! 
how long shall last his bright hour? 
thy coldness, like a vapour, stream,
 and damp our joy enliven beam,
 when once we give the generous heart,
 foredoomed to feel, to bear, and smart,
 yet find thy lovely form decay,
 thy best of feature wear away,
 thy fondness drop by slow degree,
 thy very lifeblood cold freeze,
 thy sweet attention, one by one —
 we know not why — yet see withdraw;
 the heart retire within her cave,
 and, bleed, ask a early grave! 

then go, affection! i have find
 thou both can give and heal the wound;
 but waste not one more shaft on i,
 maybe i have not more charm for thou;
 round this bend form no grace twine
 their cheerful wreath for heart like thy,
 restore i once again to i,
 and i be quit, and thou be free!
