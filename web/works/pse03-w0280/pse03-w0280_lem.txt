the vision.

quite weary with the business of the day,
 to unfrequented shade i take my way,
 and by a murmur stream supine lie. 
soft thought confuse reveal in my breast,
 till by compose slumber i be bless. 
hush be my fence as the unhaunted grove,
 and all the vision of my soul be love;
 methought i see a soft celestial youth,
 who eye speak love, and smile eternal truth:
 gay as the spring in all its vernal pride,
 with amorous joy sit pant by my side. 
i gaze with wonder at a form so bright,
 and think some Sylvane god have bless my sight;
 with equal scruple, zeal and passion move,
 if he shall be adore or be belove:
 he eye and smile dart refine delight,
 as if heaven glow glory touch the sight;
 a thousand charm his flow lock bestow,
 for every curl inevitable so:
 he welcome head on my kind bosom lay,
 on a soft flute delightful air he play. 
mean while such dear undo look he cast,
 and every note with artful motion grace:
 no youth ever seem so soften and divine,
 sure he be make for love, at least for mine. 
then be his pipe out-rivaled by his voice,
 as when he play all other music be:
 a mein so gay and shape that rival joves,
 his hand more soft than down of Venus dove. 
her young Adonis have not half his charm,
 when he most please fill her press arm;
 so kind he look, such tender thing he say,
 with eager joy i grasp the lovely shade. 
the fleet charmer soon dissolve in air,
 i search around but can not find he there,
 (then to the grove sigh love and loud despair.) 
it be Alexis form i do pursue,
 my conscious soul take the sad omen too;
 cry out the lovely youth forsake my breast,
 and will be never but in dream possess.
