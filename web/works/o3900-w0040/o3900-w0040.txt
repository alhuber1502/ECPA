EPITAPH.

ASK not, who ended here his Span? 
His Name, Reproach and Praise, was Man. 
Did no great Deeds adorn his Course? 
No Deed of His, but shew'd him worse:
 One Thing was great, which GOD supply'd,
 He suffer'd Human Life — and Dy'd. 
What Points of Knowledge did he gain? 
That Life was sacred all — and Vain:
 Sacred how high, and vain how low? 
He knew not here, but dy'd to know.
