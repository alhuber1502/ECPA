epitaph.

ask not, who end here his span? 
his name, reproach and praise, be man. 
do not great deed adorn his course? 
no deed of he, but show he worse:
 one thing be great, which god supply,
 he suffer human life — and die. 
what point of knowledge do he gain? 
that life be sacred all — and vain:
 sacred how high, and vain how low? 
he know not here, but die to know.
