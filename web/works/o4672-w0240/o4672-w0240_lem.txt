long for heaven, or, the song of angel above.

i 

earth have detain i prisoner long,
 and I be grow weary now;
 my heart, my hand, my ear, my tongue,
 there be nothing here for you. 

ii.

tire in my thought i stretch i down,
 and upward glance my eye,
 upward (my father) to thy throne,
 and to my native sky. 

iii.

there the dear man my saviour sit,
 the god, how bright he shine! 
and scatter infinite delight
 on all the happy mind. 

iv.

seraph with elevate strain
 circle the throne around,
 and move and charm the starry plain
 with a immortal sound. 

v. 

Jesus the lord their harp employ,
 Jesus my love they sing,
 Jesus the name of both our joy
 sound sweet from every string. 

vi.

hark, how beyond the narrow bound
 of time and space they run,
 and speak in most majestic sound
 the godhead of the son. 

vii.

how on the father breast he lie
 the darling of his soul,
 infinite year before the day,
 or heaven begin to roll. 

viii.

and now they sink the lofty tone,
 and mild note they play,
 and bring the eternal godhead down
 to dwell in humble clay. 

ix.

o the dear beauty of that man! 
(the god reside within)
 his flesh all pure without a stain,
 his soul without a sin. 

x. 

then, how he look, and how he smile,
 what wondrous thing he say,
 sweet cherub, stay, dwell here a while,
 and tell what Jesus do. 

xi.

at his command the blind awake,
 and feel the gladsome ray;
 he bid the dumb attempt to speak,
 they try their tongue in praise. 

xii.

he shed a thousand blessing round
 where here he turn his eye;
 he speak, and at the sovereign sound
 the hellish legion fly. 

xiii.

thus while with unambitious strife
 the ethereal minstrel rove
 through all the labour of his life,
 and wonder of his love. 

xiv.

in the full choir a break string
 groan with a strange surprise;
 the rest in silence mourn their king
 that bleed and love and die. 

XV. 

the little saint with drop wing
 cease their harmonious breath,
 no bloom tree, nor bubble spring,
 while Jesus sleep in death. 

xvi.

then all at once to live strain
 they summon every chord,
 break up the tomb, and burst his chain,
 and show their rise lord. 

xvii.

around the flame army throng
 to guard he to the sky,
 with loud hosannah on their tongue,
 and triumph in their eye. 

xviii.

in awful state the conquer god
 ascend his shine throne,
 while tuneful angel sound abroad
 the victory he have win. 

xix.

now let i rise, and join their song,
 and be a angel too;
 my heart, my hand, my ear, my tongue,
 here be joyful work for you. 

xx.

i will begin the music here
 and so my soul shall rise,
 oh for some heavenly note to bear
 my spirit to the sky! 

xxi.

there, you that love my saviour, sit,
 there i will fain have place,
 among your throne, or at your foot,
 so i may see his face. 

xxii.

i be confine to earth no more,
 but mount in haste above
 to bless the god that i adore,
 and sing the man i love.
