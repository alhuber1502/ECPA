by the same.

the dart of Izdabel prevail! it be dip
in double poison — i shall soon arrive
at the bless island, where no tiger spring
on heedless hunter; where anana's bloom
thrice in each moon; where river smooth glide,
nor thunder torrent whirl the light canoe
down to the sea; where my forefather feast
daily on heart of Spaniard! — o my son,
i feel the venom busy in my breast,
approach, and bring my crown, deck with the tooth
of that bold christian who first dare deflour
the virgin of the sun; and, dire to tell!
rob pachacamac altar of its gem!
i mark the spot where they inter this traitor,
and once at midnight steal i to his tomb,
and tear his carcase from the earth, and leave it
a prey to poisonous fly. preserve this crown
with sacred secrecy: if ever return
thy much-loved mother from the desert wood
where, as i hunt late; i hapless lose she,
cherish her age. tell she i never have worship
with those that eat their god. and when disease
prey on her languid limb, then kind stab she
with thy own hand, nor suffer she to linger,
like christian coward, in a life of pain.
i go! great COPAC beckon i! farewell!
