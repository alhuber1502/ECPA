inscription on a grotto of shell at crux-easton, the work of nine young lady.

by mr. pope.

here shun idleness at once and praise,
this radiant pile nine rural sister raise;
the glitter emblem of each spotless dame,
clear as her soul, and shine as her frame;

beauty which nature only can impart,
and such a polish as disgrace art;
but fate dispose they in this humble sort,
and hide in desert what will charm a court.
