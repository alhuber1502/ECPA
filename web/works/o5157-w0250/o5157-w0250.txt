Inscription on a GROTTO of Shells at CRUX-EASTON, the Work of Nine young Ladies.

By Mr. POPE.

HERE shunning idleness at once and praise,
This radiant pile nine rural sisters raise;
The glitt'ring emblem of each spotless dame,
Clear as her soul, and shining as her frame;

Beauty which Nature only can impart,
And such a polish as disgraces Art;
But Fate dispos'd them in this humble sort,
And hid in desarts what wou'd charm a court.
