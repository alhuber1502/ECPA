hymn of thanksgiving to the father.

i 

thou, o my god and king,
 my father, thou i sing! 
hear well-pleased the joyous sound,
 praise from earth and heaven receive;
 lose, i now in Christ be find,
 dead, by faith in Christ i live. 

ii.

father, behold thy son,
 in Christ i be thy own. 
stranger long to thou and rest,
 see the prodigal be come:
 open wide thy arm and breast,
 take the weary wanderer home. 

iii.

thy eye observe from far,
 thy pity look i near:
 i thy bowel yearn to see,
 i thy mercy run to find,
 empty, poor, and void of thou,
 hungry, sick, and faint, and blind. 

iv.

thou on my neck do fall,
 thy kiss forgive i all:
 still the gracious word i hear,
 word that make the saviour mine,
 haste, for he the robe prepare,
 his be righteousness divine! 

v. 

thou then, my god and king,
 my father, thou i sing! 
hear well-pleased the joyous sound,
 praise from earth and heaven receive;
 lose, i now in Christ be find,
 dead, by faith in Christ i live.
