epistle to Sappho.

by the same.

while yet no amorous youth around thou bow,
 nor flatter verse convey the faithless vow;
 to grave note will sappho soul attend,
 and ere she hear the lover, hear the friend? 

let maid less bless employ their mean art
 to reign proud tyrant over unnumbered heart;
 may Sappho learn (for noble triumph bear)
 those little conquest of her sex to scorn. 
to form thy bosom to each generous deed;
 to plant thy mind with every useful seed;
 be these thy art: nor spare the grateful toil,
 where nature hand have bless the happy soil. 
so shall thou know, with please skill, to blend
 the lovely mistress, and instructive friend:
 so shall thou know, when unrelenting time
 shall spoil those charm yet open to their prime,
 to ease the loss of beauty transient flower,
 while reason keep what rapture give before. 
and oh! while wit, fair dawn, spread its ray,
 serene rise to a glorious day,
 to hail the grow lustre oft be i,
 thou early favourite of the sacred nine! 

and shall the muse with blameless boast pretend,
 in youth gay bloom that Sappho call i friend:
 that urge by i she shun the dangerous way,
 where heedless maid in endless error stray;
 that scorn soon her sex idler art,
 fair praise inspire and virtue warm her heart;
 that fond to reach the distant path of fame,
 i teach she infant genius where to aim? 
thus when the feather choir first tempt the sky,
 and all unskilled their feeble pinion try,
 the experience sire prescribe the adventurous height,
 guide the young wing, and please attend the flight.
