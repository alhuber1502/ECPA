on the death of a just admire author.

when pale-eyed winter rule the mourn field,
 and shiver nature to his sceptre yield,
 deject earth be stripe of all her pride,
 and skulk flower in her bosom hide;
 through naked groves afflict warbler fly,
 and storm of hail come rattle through the sky:
 but when soft April lift her downy wing,
 and call the blush infant of the spring,
 the verdant groves their wonted charm regain,
 and laugh nature paint the gaudy plain;
 sweet-scented violet take their usual blue,
 and the fair primrose drink the morning dew;
 again revive their beauty and their smell,
 but man once blast take a long farewell. 
ah silly Muse! thy fond complaint give over,
 depart Sylvius shall return no more:
 no charm of verse can win the heavenly mind,
 back to the slight case she leave behind;
 not though each line shall make our bosom glow,
 like his grand number, and as sweet flow. 

his name shall last to warm a distant age,
 nor want the assistance of a titlepage;
 for his bright line be by their lustre know,
 even Homer shine with beauty not his own:
 unpolished soul, like Codrus or like i,
 fill with idea that but dim shine,
 read over the charm of his instructive pen,
 and taste of rapture never know till then. 
ill-nature listen, and approve the song;
 and blush envy check her burn tongue:
 happy be those, though grief their hour attend,
 who once he honour with the name of friend;
 who please thought at least may ponder over
 the smile day, that shall return no more:
 even we condemn at distance to admire,
 bewail the hope that with our guide expire:
 ah! who shall now our rustic thought refine,
 and to grave sense and solid learning join
 wit ever sparkle, and the sweet of rhyme? 
farewell, you theme, which none but he can sing,
 and sylvan scene that wear eternal spring;
 fair nymph, that in his fair painting glow,
 and you smooth line that Sylvius teach to flow:
 but hush, sad Muse, thy dull complaint give over:
 hence sigh in secret, and his loss deplore,
 who never, o never, shall grace our regious more.
