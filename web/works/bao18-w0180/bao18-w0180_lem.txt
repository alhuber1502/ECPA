to HENRY.

think not, while fair nymph invite
 thy foot, dear youth, to pleasure bower,
 my fade form shall meet thy sight,
 and cloud my Henry smile hour. 

thou be the world delight guest,
 and all that pride desire be thy;
 then i will not wound thy generous breast,
 by number over the woe of i. 

i will not say how well, how long
 this faithful heart have sigh for thou;
 but leave thou happy nymph among,
 content if thou content be. 

but, Henry, shall misfortune hand
 bid all thy youth fond triumph fly,
 the crimson from thy lip command,
 and force the lustre from thy eye, .... 

then, thoughtless of my own distress,
 i will haste thy comforter to prove;
 and Henry shall my friendship bless,
 although, alas! he scorn my love.
