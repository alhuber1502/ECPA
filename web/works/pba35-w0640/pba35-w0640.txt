To the Reverend Dr. Lâ€”.

Occasion'd by his Sermon for the Support of the Charity-Children at Tunbridge-Wells, where the Collection was small.

In vain you shew a happy Nation,
 The Gospel's gracious Dispensation;
 And plead from thence, to bring up Youth
 To early Piety and Truth. 
To unattentive Ears you preach,
 What Miseries alone can teach. 

'Tis said, Hibernia boasts a Flood,
 Famous for petrefying Wood:
 Tunbridge, thy Min'ral Streams, we know,
 A stranger Transformation show:
 Their dire Effects the Wretched feel:
 Thy Waters turn the Heart to Steel.
