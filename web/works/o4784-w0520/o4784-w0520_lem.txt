[Tasso, aminta:] from the aminta of Tasso. 

part of the description of the golden age.

then, by some fountain flowery side
 the love unarmed, do still abide. 
then, the loose quiver careless hang,
 the torch extinct, the bow unstring. 
then, by the nymph no charm be wear,
 but such as with the nymph be bear. 
the shepherd can not, then, complain,
 nor tell his amorous tale in vain. 
no veil the beauteous face do hide,
 nor harmless freedom be deny. 
then, innocence and virtue reign
 pure, unaffected, unconstrained. 
love be their pleasure, and their praise,
 the soft employment of their day.
