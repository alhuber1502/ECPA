TO MISS H—L—D.

1768.

COUNT all the flow'rs that deck the meadow's side,
 When Flora flourishes in new-born pride;
 Count all the sparkling orbits in the sky;
 Count all the birds that thro' the aether sly;
 Count all the foliage of the lofty trees,
 That fly before the bleak autumnal breeze;
 Count all the dewy blades of verdant grass;
 Count all the drops of rain that softly pass
 Thro' the blue aether; or tempestuous roar;
 Count all the sands upon the breaking shore;
 Count all the minutes since the world began,
 Count all the troubles of the life of man;
 Count all the torments of the d—n'd in Hell,
 More are the beauteous charms that makes my Nymph excell.
