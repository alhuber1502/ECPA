count all the flower that deck the meadow side,
 when Flora flourish in new-born pride;
 count all the sparkle orbit in the sky;
 count all the bird that through the aether sly;
 count all the foliage of the lofty tree,
 that fly before the bleak autumnal breeze;
 count all the dewy blade of verdant grass;
 count all the drop of rain that soft pass
 through the blue aether; or tempestuous roar;
 count all the sand upon the break shore;
 count all the minute since the world begin,
 count all the trouble of the life of man;
 count all the torment of the d—ned in hell,
 more be the beauteous charm that make my nymph excel.
