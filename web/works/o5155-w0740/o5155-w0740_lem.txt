Dennis to mr. Thomson, who have procure he a benefit night.

reflect on thy worth, methinks i find
thy various season in their author mind.
spring open her blossom, various as thy muse,
and, like thy soft compassion, shed her dew.
summer hot drought in thy expression glow,
and over each page a tawny ripeness throw.
autumn rich fruit the instruct reader gain,
who taste the meaning purpose of thy strain.
winter â€” but that no semblance take from thou:
that hoary season yield a type of i.
shatter by time bleak storm i wither lie,
leafless, and whiten in a cold decay!
yet shall my propless ivy, pale and bend,
bless the short sunshine which thy pity lend.
