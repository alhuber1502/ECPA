verse

write on a foreigner visit the grave of a Swiss gentleman, bury among the descendent of sir WILLIAM Wallace, guardian of Scotland in the thirteenth century.

our regal seat to Edward fall a prey,
 our chief insult corpse his victim lie;
 our ruin land no monument can raise;
 yet grateful bard still sing his heart-felt praise. 
long age hence her hero still she will mourn;
 still her brave son with emulation burn. 
his spirit guard still our native place,
 proclaim this mandate to his late race:
 "let sacred truth bid live fame be thy;
"never trust for honour to a sculpture shrine. 
 "those modest merit marble never impart,
"love write they deep on the human heart. " 

thus amid thy race do their love Henry dwell,
 who dust shall mix thy memory with tell:
 truth, honour, spirit animate that form,
 which beauty, grace, and symmetry adorn. 
here that rich blossom drop, scarce fair blow;
 the friend, the husband, father we bemoan! 
wail by the grave a mother cheerless throe,
 and share a widow agonize woe! 

dear youth, thy name to late time descend,
 where gentle virtue make mankind thy friend. 
from no vain marble need you borrow fame;
 truth, love and friendship, here embalm thy name. 
a parent silver hair bestrew thy shrine;
 her grief be mortal, but her joy sublime:
 in tear we mourn the body lay to rest;
 she hail thy spotless soul 'amid angel bless.
