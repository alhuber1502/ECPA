a ode.

i 

while from our look, fair nymph, you guess
 the secret passion of our mind;
 my heavy eye, you say, confess
 a heart to love and grief incline. 

ii.

there need, alas! but little art,
 to have this fatal secret find:
 with the same ease you throw the dart,
 it be certain, you may show the wound. 

iii.

how can i see you, and not love;
 while you as open east be fair? 
while cold as northern blast you prove;
 how can i love, and not despair? 

iv.

the wretch in double fetter bound
 your potent mercy may release:
 soon, if my love but once be crown,
 fair prophetess, my grief will cease.
