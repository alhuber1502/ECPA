on a fan

now i have paint these flower, say what can i do,
 to render they worthy acceptance from you? 
i know of no sybil, who wonderful art
 can to they superior virtue impart,
 who, of magical influence wonder can tell,
 and, who over each blossom can mutter a spell. 

you only the humble enchantment can prove,
 that arise from esteem, from respect, and from love:
 with such i assail you, and powerful the charm,
 when apply to a heart sympathetic and warm;
 to a heart such as that, which, if right i divine,
 o c—ll—n—n! dwell in that bosom of thy.
