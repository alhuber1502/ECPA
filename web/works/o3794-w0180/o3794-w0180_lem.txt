on observe some name of little note record in the biographia britannica. 

oh fond attempt to give a deathless lot,
 to name ignoble, bear to be forget! 
in vain record in historic page,
 they court the notice of a future age,
 those twinkle tiney lustre of the land,
 drop one by one from fame neglect hand,
 lethaean gulf receive they as they fall,
 and dark oblivion soon absorb they all. 
so when a child, as playful child use,
 have burn to tinder a stale last year news,
 the flame extinct, he view the rove fire,
 there go my lady, and there go the esquire,
 there go the parson, oh! illustrious spark,
 and there, scarce less illustrious, go the clerk.
