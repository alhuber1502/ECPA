against freewill.

a song.

i 

go silly mortal, and ask thy creator,
why thy short life be torment with care,
why thou be slave to the folly of nature,
why for thy plague he make woman so fair?
if cloe glance
can charm thy sense,
and beauty force thou into her snare;
what be this free will of which gownmen so prate,
when none, none, have power to control their fate.

ii.

if man be monarch of all the creation,
woman in reason shall stoop to his sway;
fair, rich, or witty, by free inclination
own his privilege, calm obey:
else every brute be
more bless with beauty.
the horse or stag each can seize his prey,
who ever in the grove see the lordly bull,
sigh to the fair, she like a love fool.
