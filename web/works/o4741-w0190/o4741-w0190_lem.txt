proper ingredient to make a sceptic. 

will you, my friend, a finish sceptic make,
 to form his nature, these material take:
 a little learning; twenty grains of sense,
 join with a double share of ignorance;
 infuse a little wit into the Scull,
 which never fail to make a mighty fool;
 two dram of faith; a tun of doubt next;
 let all be with the dregs of reason mix:
 when in his mind, these jar seed be sow,
 he will censure all thing, but approve of none.
