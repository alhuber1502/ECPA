Proper Ingredients to make a Sceptic. 

WOULD you, my Friend, a finish'd Sceptic make,
 To form his Nature, these Materials take:
 A little Learning; twenty Grains of Sense,
 Join'd with a double Share of Ignorance;
 Infuse a little Wit into the Scull,
 Which never fails to make a mighty Fool;
 Two Drams of Faith; a Tun of Doubting next;
 Let all be with the Dregs of Reason mixt:
 When in his Mind, these jarring Seeds are sown,
 He'll censure all Things, but approve of none.
