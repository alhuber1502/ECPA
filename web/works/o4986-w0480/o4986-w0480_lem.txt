to the right honourable the earl of Chesterfield. on his late recovery from a dangerous illness.

by the reverend WALTER Harte.

at length, in pity to a nation prayer,
 thou live, o stanhope, providence care:
 "life sun, we read, when heaven a respite lend,
" ten degree back against the shade descend. " 
by wisdom purify, by age inspire;
 for twice nine year in Greenwich grove retire;
 rapt like Elijah in the aërial car,
 thou wise mark this busy world from far:
 where avarice and ambition vain run,
 this to undo, and that to be undo. —
 considerate truth be now thy favourite theme;
 age may see vision, though our youth dream dream:
 hail true wise, and good! o happy thou
 than if state diadem have grace thy brow! 

like sage Aeneas, mantle in a cloud,
 unseen you see the falsehood of the crowd:
 brother his brother cheat, and friend his friend: —
 life vain wise man prove blockhead in the end. —
 thou see, like ADAM by the archangel lead,
 the many people earth beneath thou spread;
 (thy eye much purge with euphrasy and rue,
 for even a Chesterfield have much to view)
 thou see like he the plague of human strife,
 the snare of greatness, emptiness of life,
 abner sincerity, and joab heart,
 achitophel deep scheme, and zimrl part;
 shimei ill-nature, and (to mark the time)
 the flattery of Og and doeg rhyme. 
o still contemplate, look through reason eye, —
 for hour be precious age when we die! 

thus, even in pagan time, the choose few,
 Pomponius, scipio, atticus, withdraw:
 thus dioclesian, with true greatness fire,
 from lordly Rome to Spalatro retire;
 exchange the imperial fasces for a spade,
 and left court sunshine for the sylvan shade;
 lord of himself, monarch of field and plain,
 by nature call to rule, and crown by swain.
