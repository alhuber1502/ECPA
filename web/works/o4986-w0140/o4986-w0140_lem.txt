the hermit.

at the close of the day, when the hamlet be still,
 and mortal the sweet of forgetfulness prove,
 when nought but the torrent be hear on the hill,
 and nought but the nightingale song in the grove;
 it be then, by the cave of a mountain, recline,
 a hermit his nightly complaint thus begin,
 though mournful his voice, his heart be resign,
 he think as a sage, but he feel as a man. 

 "ah, why thus abandon to mourning and woe,
" why thus, lonely philomel, flow thy sad strain? 
 "for spring shall return, and a lover bestow,
" and thy bosom no trace of dejection retain;
 "yet if pity inspire thou, ah, cease not thy lay,
" mourn, sweet complain, man call thou to mourn,
 "o soothe he who pleasure like thy pass away,
" full swift they pass, but they never return. 

 "now glide remote on the verge of the sky,
" the moon, half extinct, her wan crescent display:
 "yet late i see, where majestic on high,
" she shine, and the star be conceal in her ray;
 "roil on, thou fair orb, and with gladness pursue
" the path that conduct thou to splendour again;
 "but man fade glory no change shall renew,
" ah, fool! to exult in a glory so vain. 

 "it be dark, and the landscape be lovely no more,
" i mourn not, you woodland, i mourn not for you;
 "for morn shall return, all your charm to restore,
" perfume with fresh fragrance, and glitter with dew:
 "nor yet for the ravage of winter i mourn,
" kind nature the embryo blossom shall save;
 "but when shall spring visit the moulder urn? 
" oh, when shall it dawn on the gloom of the grave? "
