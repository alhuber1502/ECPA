POOR MAILIE'S ELEGY.

LAMENT in rhyme, lament in prose,
 Wi' saut tears trickling down your nose;
 Our Bardie's fate is at a close,
 Past a' remead! 
The last, sad cape-stane of his woes;
 Poor Mailie's dead! 

It's no the loss o' warl's gear,
 That could sae bitter draw the tear,
 Or make our Bardie, dowie, wear
 The mourning weed
 He's lost a friend and neebor dear,
 In Mailie dead. 

Thro' a' the town she trotted by him;
 A lang half-mile she could descry him;
 Wi' kindly bleat, when she did spy him,
 She ran wi' speed:
 A friend mair faithfu' ne'er came nigh him,
 Than Mailie dead. 

I wat she was a sheep o' sense,
 An' could behave hersel wi' mense:
 I'll say't, she never brak a fence,
 Thro' thievish greed. 
Our Bardie, lanely, keeps the spence
 Sin' Mailie's dead. 

Or, if he wanders up the howe,
 Her living image in her yowe,
 Comes bleating till him, owre the knowe,
 For bits o' bread;
 An' down the briny pearls rowe
 For Mailie dead. 

She was nae get o' moorlan tips,
 Wi' tauted ket, an' hairy hips;
 For her forbears were brought in ships,
 Frae' yont the TWEED
 A bonier fleesh ne'er cross'd the clips
 Than Mailie's dead. 

Wae worth that man wha first did shape,
 That vile, wanchancie thing â€” a raep! 
It maks guid fellows girn an' gape,
 Wi' chokin dread;
 An' Robin's bonnet wave wi' crape
 For Mailie dead. 

O, a' ye Bards on bonie DOON! 
An' wha on AIRE your chanters tune! 
Come, join the melancholious croon
 O' Robin's reed! 
His heart will never get aboon! 
His Mailie's dead!
