write from bath to a friend in the country, in the year 1783. 

what! breathe anstëan air, and yet not send
 one amble rhyme to my sequester friend;
 forbid it every muse of avon stream,
 (apollo chief resort, if right i deem);
 and you, you nine, which over batheaston urn
 preside, to give the myrtle wreath, or burn;
 who at the call of many a dare wight,
 who never before in verse essay to write,
 attendant fly, impregnate the air
 with ode and sonnet to the bloom fair,
 to i, your suppliant, deign to waste a breeze
 from avon bank, and fame batheaston tree;
 thus bear aloft Parnassus hill i will climb,
 and write my journal in anstëan rhyme. 
so first take in a great gulp of the air,
 and try to find the poetical chair,
 to tell you my history with speed i prepare. 

for sure it be right my relation shall know it,
 that their wander cousin be turn out a poet;
 an, well will it be, since this place be so dear,
 can she turn a chameleon, and live on the air,
 or like poet of old, to a garret retire,
 and never to a hall or a parlour aspire;
 for, strange to relate it, there be not to be find
 two room by the year under fifty good pound;
 but since it be the fashion to spend all one worth,
 it be best to bestow it on pleasure and mirth,
 so at bath will i live, let it end as it may,
 and a lodging i will take in the street title gay. 
but how to describe the fine fight which i see,
 or the lady Bab frightful, who drink up my tea,
 with all their fine speech to i and my friend,
 with the ticket for ball, or the note which they send;
 for all so polite be, so civil and kind,
 that to tell you the half on it not word can i find;
 nor must i omit how the morning glide on,
 for i be tell to waste time be entire the tun,
 so i be sure i be right in the method i take,
 for i waste all my time from the hour i awake;
 for what more can do it, than breakfast out,
 and then in the street to go stroll about,
 then step to the painter to rest i a while,
 acquaintance to meet, and the hour to beguile,
 or else to the pump-room, by way of a frolic,
 to drink of the water, which give i the cholic:
 but i be tell at this place it be genteel to be ill,
 so i have get my good landlord to give i a pill,
 and to add a few draught to make up a bill. 
then home to my dinner with speed i repair,
 which quick be over, then to dress my hair;
 for who can appear in a place so polite,
 unless on the head each hair stand upright;
 or who in a circle be fit to be see
 unless dress as young as if bare fifteen. 
this business when end with trouble and care,
 without loss of time i get into my chair,
 and straight to the ball-room or playhouse i haste,
 for visit of friendship be quite out of taste;
 nay, i be tell it be vulgar beyond all compare
 to own a relation, though ever so near. 

but what pen can describe the high head i behold,
 not tire like the matron we read of, when old;
 no, these pretty creature be just the reverse,
 and their head at a distance appear like a hearse,
 with plume sweet, nod, with plait and with gold,
 with thing out of number which never can be tell,
 which serve to convince i saint Peter not read
 by folk of high taste, who be perfect breed;
 and i can but believe that they pass all the morning
 in learning to dance, and their head thus adorn. 
oh, be you to see the fine caper they give,
 you never will forget it as long as you live;
 but i can relate you the half that i see,
 nor how we eat cake, or how we drink tea,
 for the clock have strike six, and the post at the door;
 but if this shall delight you, you soon shall have more.
