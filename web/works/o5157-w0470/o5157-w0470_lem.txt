last night when i lay i to rest;
and methinks i be incline
to a change of my mind,
for, you know, second thought be the best,

to our praise to be find,
in a world so abound with evil,
unspotted and pure;
though not so demure,
as to wage open war with the devil,

iv.

then bid farewell
to the thought of a cell,
i will prepare for a militant life;
and if bring to distress,
why then â€” i will confess,
and do penance in shape of a wife.
