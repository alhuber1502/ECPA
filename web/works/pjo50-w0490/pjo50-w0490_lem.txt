life.

(occasion by some line upon death.)

say, Delia, have not death a pain
 beyond what mortal fear, or feign? 
beyond the oppressor scourge, or scorn? 
beyond what suffering worth may mourn? 
do not the wise, the learn, the great,
 at his approach, appal, retreat? 
do not the brave with horror start,
 and, shock, betray the unconquered heart? 
to death for ease we fly in vain,
 and pleasure lose for certain pain. 

nor be this all. the conscious mind
 connect a awful scene behind:
 where every crime shall be expose,
 and every secret guilt disclose;
 where heart unused to melt, shall bleed,
 and sad remorse, with pang succeed. 

then cease awhile the doubtful strife,
 and, reconcile, look back on life. 
how full of smile be it begin! 
with what delight do youth glide on! 
what pleasure sparkle in our eye,
 when first the infant passion rise! 
if love invade the sprightly vein,
 with all its care, and please pain;
 though absence heighten the distress,
 or jealous fear disturb our peace;
 though the soft flame, with which we burn,
 be pay with pride, neglect, or scorn;
 slight he the nymph, or she the swain,
 yet there be a pleasure in the pain. 

in friendship what relief we find! 
what ease, from interest thus combine;
 by mutual tie of honour bind,
 how kind, how faithful, friend be find! 
how full each word! how fair each deed! 
(save just in case of real need)
 without reserve their joy they share,
 and by divide, lessen care. 

what though dull moralist of old,
 strange tale of break faith have tell;
 what though there be, for private end,
 those who debase the name of friend;
 yet these be thing do long ago,
 the world be strange mend now! 
and in this upright age we see,
 friend be — what they appear to be. 

next young ambition smile bring
 alternate joy to slave and king. 
the monarch, lo! in transport hurl,
 survey in thought a conquer world. 
the peasant over his clod espy
 preferment, riches, honour rise;
 till, (what sometime be vast odd)
 the vision fly, and leave the clod:
 yet expectation gild his joy;
 fruition only cure, and cloy. 
gay, bloom expectation stray
 to charm scene, through charm way;
 with wondrous art it can foresee
 what never be, nor ever can be:
 yet who will wish to spy the cheat? 
or who will not hug the dear deceit? 
since life prime bliss, it be believe,
 consist in being — well-deceived. 

nor must we laugh at, nor may blame
 the man who thirst, or bleed for fame. 
renown, though late, at length succeed,
 to recompense his glorious deed;
 and though it come not till his fall,
 it be better late — than not at all. 

observe the man of dress, and lace:
 how soft his air! how sweet his face! 
the youth have love, and learn to dance:
 and now he travel into France,
 fresh manner to import, and mark
 the sword-knot of the grand monarch. 
then, fine and finish, homeward rove,
 each taste correct, refine, improve;
 admire awhile, and be admire;
 and tire other, till he be tire,
 walk off, a little sick of life,
 and take, by way of cure, a wife:
 enquire — who house be to be let,
 (his own be quit for a debt)
 then, as his finance require,
 to frugal Yorkshire do retire,
 and end a plain, content 'squire. 

nor youth alone have joy in view,
 age have its satisfaction too. 
who envy not the miser store? 
who seem rich, and real poor,
 yet that one passion, lust of gain,
 support he under every pain:
 amid a thousand ill he will thrive,
 and think it worth his while to live. 
the venerable sage, who deal
 in long, insipid, ancient tale,
 who dwell on feat of former time,
 and loud tax modern crime;
 who tedious lore at morn begin,
 and end but with the set sun;
 at ninety odd, this happy man
 repine, that life be but a span! 
that as the spark fly upward all,
 so mortal man be doom to fall! 
that flesh be grass; and like the flower,
 spring, bloom, and die within a hour! —
 more truth, perhaps, he may unfold;
 but ah! he die; his tale be tell. 

nor be these all the joy of age:
 love may exert its feeble rage
 through each reanimated vein,
 enliven all the heart again:
 past scene restore to its view,
 and warmth, as well as youth renew. 
nor this preposterous call, or strange;
 winter itself, grow old, will change,
 and put spring youthful livery on,
 pervade by the generous sun. 

Delia, if this be life, and these
 can pass it off with so much ease;
 or all-enamoured with the scene,
 will act it over and over again:
 if these can taste the present hour,
 what joy have wisdom in her power! 
who lead, with last pleasure bless,
 fair virtue, ever-cheerful guest! 
the constant inmate of your breast. 

with Delia, love a gentle flame,
 who source be honour and esteem. 
her friendship still be more refine,
 a generous sympathy of mind. 
ambitious — only to excel,
 and be supreme in do well. 
and hence, as a reward, may claim
 our just return of praise, and fame. 

live then, and condescend to taste,
 though you be digust with the feast;
 live for your own, for virtue sake,
 and pleasure with the wise partake:
 and (if the fate so much decree)
 a little long live — for i.
