THE FAIRIES.

TO MISS GRIMSTON, YOUNGEST SISTER OF THOMAS GRIMSTON, ESQ. OF GRIMSTON, YORKSHIRE.

HOUS'D within the cowslip's bell,
 As the simple milk maids tell;
 Shunning there the glare of day,
 Fairies pass their hours away. 
There they keep their mimic state;
 There the fall of night await;
 Then along their fav'rite hill,
 Or beside some haunted rill. 
Whilst around dull mortals sleep,
 Mystic vigils there they keep,
 With some wild fantastic rite
 Greeting still the pow'r of night.
