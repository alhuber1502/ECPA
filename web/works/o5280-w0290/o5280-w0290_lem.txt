the fairy.

to miss Grimston, young sister of THOMAS Grimston, ESQ. of Grimston, Yorkshire.

house within the cowslip bell,
 as the simple milk maid tell;
 shun there the glare of day,
 fairy pass their hour away. 
there they keep their mimic state;
 there the fall of night await;
 then along their favourite hill,
 or beside some haunt rill. 
while around dull mortal sleep,
 mystic vigil there they keep,
 with some wild fantastic rite
 greeting still the power of night.
