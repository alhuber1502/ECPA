a ode on the death of mr. Pelham.

by mr. Garrick.

let other hail the rise sun,
i bow to that who course be run,
which set in endless night;
who ray benignant bless this isle,
make peaceful nature round we smile
with calm, but cheerful light.

no bounty past provoke my praise,
no future prospect prompt my lay,
from real grief they flow;
i catch the alarm from britain fear,
my sorrow fall with britain tear,
and join a nation woe.

see — as you pass the crowd street,
despondence cloud each face you meet,
all their lose friend deplore:
you read in every pensive eye,
you hear in every break sigh,
that Pelham be no more.

if thus each briton be alarm,
who but his distant influence warm,
what grief their breast must rend,
who in his private virtue bless,
by nature dear tie possess
the husband, father, friend!

what! mute you bard? — no mournful verse,
no chaplet to adorn his hearse,
to crown the good and just?
your flower in warm region bloom,
you seek no pension from the tomb,
no laurel from the dust.

when power depart with his breath,
the son of flattery flee from death:
such insect swarm at noon.
not for herself my muse be grieve,
she never ask, nor ever receive,
one ministerial boon.

have some peculiar strange offence,
against we arm omnipotence,
to check the nation pride?
behold the appoint punishment!
at length the vengeful bolt be send,
it fall — when Pelham die!

unchecked by shame, unawed by dread,
when vice triumphant rear her head,
vengeance can sleep no more;
the evil angel stalk at large,
the good submit, resign his charge,
and quit the unhallowed shore.

the same sad morn to church and state,
(so for our sin it be fix by fate)
a double stroke be give;
black as the whirlwind of the north,
saint J—n's fell genius issue forth,
and Pelham flee to heaven!

by angel watch in eden bower,
our parent pass their peaceful hour,
nor guilt nor pain they know;
but on the day which usher in
the hellborn train of mortal sin,
the heavenly guard withdraw.

look down, much honour shade, below,
still let thy pity aid our woe;
stretch out thy heal hand;
resume those feeling, which on earth
proclaim thy patriot love and worth,
and save a sink land.

search with thy more than mortal eye,
the breast of all thy friend: descry
what there have get possession.
see if thy unsuspecting heart,
in some for truth mistake not art,
for principle, profession.

from these, the pest of human kind,
who royal bounty can bind,
protect our parent king:
unmask their treachery to his sight,
drag forth the viper into light,
and crush they ere they sting.

if such his trust and honour share,
again exert thy guardian care,
each venom heart disclose;
on he, on he, our all depend,
oh save he from his treacherous friend,
he can fear his foe.

whoever shall at the helm preside,
still let thy prudence be his guide,
to stem the trouble wave;
but chief whisper in his ear,
"that GEORGE be open, just, sincere,
"and dare to scorn a knave. "

no selfish view to oppress mankind,
no mad ambition fire thy mind,
to purchase fame with blood;
thy bosom glow with pure heat;
convince that to be true great,
be only to be good.

to hear no lawless passion call,
to serve thy king, yet feel for all,
such be thy glorious plan!
wisdom with generous love take part,
together work thy head and heart,
the minister and man.

unite, you kindred son of worth;
strangle bold faction in its birth;
be britain weal your view!
for this great end let all combine,
let virtue link each fair design,
and Pelham live in you.
