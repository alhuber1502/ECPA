A REFLECTION on the foregoing ODE. 

AND is this all? Can reason do no more
 Than bid me shun the deep and dread the shore? 
Sweet moralist! afloat on life's rough sea
 The christian has an art unknown to thee;
 He holds no parley with unmanly sears,
 Where duty bids he confidently steers,
 Faces a thousand dangers at her call,
 And trusting in his God, surmounts them all.
