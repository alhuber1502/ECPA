a reflection on the forgo ode. 

and be this all? can reason do no more
 than bid i shun the deep and dread the shore? 
sweet moralist! afloat on life rough sea
 the christian have a art unknown to thou;
 he hold no parley with unmanly fear,
 where duty bid he confident steer,
 face a thousand danger at her call,
 and trust in his god, surmount they all.
