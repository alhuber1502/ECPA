[fragment] xiv.

duchommar.

morna, thou fair of woman, daughter of Cormac-Carbre! why in the circle of stone, in the cave of the rock, alone? the stream murmur hoarse. the blast groan in the age tree. the lake be trouble before thou. dark be the cloud of the sky. but thou be like snow on the heath. thy hair like a thin cloud of gold on the top of cromleach. thy breast like two smooth rock on the hill which be see from the stream of brannuin. thy arm, as two white pillar in the hall of Fingal.


morna.

whence the son of mugruch, duchommar the most gloomy of man? dark be thy brow of terror. red thy roll eye. do Garve appear on the sea? what of the foe, duchommar?


duchommar.

from the hill i return, o morna, from the hill of the fly deer. three have i slay with my bow; three with my pant dog. daughter of Cormac-Carbre, i love thou as my soul. i have slay a deer for thou. high be his branchy head; and fleet his foot of wind.


morna.

gloomy son of mugruch, duchommar! i love thou not: hard be thy heart of rock; dark thy terrible brow. but cadmor the son of tarman, thou be the love of morna! thou be like a sunbeam on the hill, in the day of the gloomy storm. see thou the son of tarman, lovely on the hill of the chace? here the daughter of Cormac-Carbre wait the come of cadmor.


duchommar.

and long shall morna wait. his blood be on my sword. i meet he by the mossy stone, by the oak of the noisy stream. he fight; but i slay he; his blood be on my sword. high on the hill i will raise his tomb, daughter of Cormac-Carbre. but love thou the son of mugruch; his arm be strong as a storm.


morna.

and be the son of tarman fall; the youth with the breast of snow! the first in the chace of the hill; the foe of the son of the ocean! — duchommar, thou be gloomy indeed; cruel be thy arm to i. — but give i that sword, son of mugruch; i love the blood of gadmor.

[he give she the sword, with which she instant stab he.]


duchommar.

daughter of Cormac-Carbre, thou have pierce duchommar! the sword be cold in my breast; thou have kill the son of mugruch. give i to moinie the maid; for much she love duchommar. my tomb she will raise on the hill; the hunter shall see it, and praise i. — but draw the sword from my side, morna; i feel it cold. —

[upon her come near he, he stab she. as she fall, she pluck a stone from the side of the cave, and place it betwixt they, that his blood may not be mingle with she.]
