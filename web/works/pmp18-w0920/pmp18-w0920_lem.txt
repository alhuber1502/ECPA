Horace Lib. i. Epist. ix. Septimius, claudi, nimirum intelligit unus, quanti i facias: etc. imitate.

to the right honourable mr. HARLEY.

dear Dick, how ever it come into his head,
 believe, as firm as he do his creed,
 that you and i, sir, be extreme great;
 though i plain Mat, you minister of state. 
one word from i, without all doubt, he say,
 will fix his fortune in some little place. 
thus better than my self, it seem, he know,
 how far my interest with my patron go;
 and answer all objection i can make,
 still plunge deep in his dear mistake. 

from this wild fancy, sir, there may proceed
 one wild yet, which i foresee, and dread;
 that i, in fact, a real interest have,
 which to my own advantage i will save,
 and, with the usual courtier trick, intend
 to serve my self, forgetful of my friend. 

to shun this censure, i all shame lay by;
 and make my reason with his will comply;
 hope, for my excuse, it will be confess,
 that of two evil i have choose the least. 
so, sir, with this epistolary scroll,
 receive the partner of my inmost soul:
 he you will find in letter, and in law
 not unexpert, firm to his country be cause,
 warm in the glorious interest you pursue,
 and, in one word, a good man and a true.
