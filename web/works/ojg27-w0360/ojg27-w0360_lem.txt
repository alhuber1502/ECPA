fable [35] XXXV. 

the barley-mow and the dunghill.

how many saucy air we meet
 from Temple-bar to aldgate-street;
 proud rogue, who share the South-Sea prey,
 and spring like mushroom in a day! 
they think it mean, to condescend
 to know a brother or a friend;
 they blush to hear their mother name,
 and by their pride expose their shame. 

as cross his yard, at early day,
 a careful farmer take his way,
 he stop, and lean on his fork
 observe the flail incessant work;
 in thought he measure all his store,
 his goose, his hog he number over,
 in fancy weigh the fleece shear,
 and multiply the next year corn. 

a barley-mow, which stand beside,
 thus to its muse master cry. 

say, good sir, be it fit or right
 to treat i with neglect and slight? 
i, who contribute to your cheer,
 and raise your mirth with ale and beer! 
why thus insult, thus disgrace,
 and that vile dunghill near i place? 
be those poor sweep of a groom,
 that filthy sight, that nauseous fume
 meet object here? command it hence:
 a thing so mean must give offence. 

the humble dunghill thus reply. 
thy master hear and mock thy pride,
 insult not thus the meek and low,
 in i thy benefactor know;
 my warm assistance give thou birth,
 or thou have perish low in earth;
 but upstart, to support their station,
 cancel at once all obligation.
