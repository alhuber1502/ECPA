Erle robert mouse.

in chaucer stile. 

tway mouse, full Blythe and amicable,
 batten beside Erle robert table. 
lie there ne trap their neck to catch,
 ne old black cat their step to watch. 
their fill they eat of fowl and fish;
 feast-like as heart of mouse mote wish. 

as guest sit jovial at the board,
 forth leap our mouse: eftsoon the lord
 of Boling, whilom John the saint,
 who make oft propos full quaint,
 laugh jocund, and aloud he cry,
 to Matthew seat on oth side;
 to thou, lean bard, it do partain
 to understand these creature tweine. 
come frame we now some clean device,
 or playsant rhime on yonder mouse:
 they seem, god shield i, Mat. and Charles. 

bad as sir topaz, or esquire Quarles
 (Matthew do for the nonce reply)
 at emblem, or device be i:
 but can i chant, or rhyme, pardie,
 clear as than Chaucer, or as thou;
 ne verse from i (so god i shrive)
 on mouse, or other beast alive. 
certes, i have these many day
 send mine poetic herd to graze. 
ne arm knight ydrad in war
 with lion fierce will i compare:
 ne judge unjust, with furred fox,
 harm in secret guise the flock:
 ne priest unworth of goddess coat,
 to swine ydrunk, or filthy stoat. 
elk simil√® farewell for aye,
 from elephant, i trow, to flea. 

reply the friendlike peer, i ween,
 Matthew be anger on the spleen. 
ne so, quoth Mat. ne shall be ever,
 with wit that fall all so fair:
 eftsoon, well weet you, my intent
 bow to your commandment. 
if by these creature you have see,
 portray Charles and Matthew be;
 behoove neat to wreck my brain,
 the rest in order to explain. 

that cupboard, where the mouse disport,
 i liken to saint Stephen court:
 therein be space enough, i trow,
 for elk comrade to come and go:
 and therein eke may both be feed
 with Shiver of the wheaten bread. 
and when, as these my eye survey,
 they cease to skip, and squeak, and play;
 return they may to different cell,
 audit one, while other tell. 
dear ROBERT, quoth the saint, who mind
 in bounteous deed no mean can bind;
 now as i hope to grow devout,
 i deem this matter well make out. 
laugh i, while thus i serious pray? 
let that be wrought which Mat. do say:
 yea, quoth the Erle; but not to day.
