A SONG

Saw ye the glens, saw ye the rocks,
 Or saw ye bonny Harry Howie? 
On yonder hill he feeds his flocks,
 His flocks sae gay, himsel sae dowie. 

Yes, I hae seen the glens, the rocks,
 And I've been wading through the heather;
 And there I spied a wand'ring flock,
 Their herd was gone I know not whither. 

But hark! I hear a dismal choir
 Of bleating lambs, and shepherds mourning;
 Ah! Harry Howie is no more;
 No more wild echoes are returning. 

An urchin sly has slain the youth,
 Has slain him with a bow and quiver;
 A fairer mind of spotless truth
 From such a form Death ne'er did sever. 

Oft will I leave the festive train,
 And seek the glens and rocks sae dowie;
 There every zephyr shall explain
 What I have felt for Harry Howie.
