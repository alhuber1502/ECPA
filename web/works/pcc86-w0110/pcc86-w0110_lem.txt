earl of elgin death.

dead! 
no — in the heart of each he live who know
 his virtue. 
the prime of life — the midst of all his scheme
 too soon cut off. 
o Elgin! who ever do know thou,
 that do not love thou with a sister heart? 
thy wife — thy child — friend and kindred, tell,
 how good he be;
 or let the orphan and the poor point out
 the many proof of his benevolence. 
o! guard they still,
 nor let their sad distress,
 or wild distract grief,
 retard thy spirit from the bless abode. 
kind and compassionate,
 amiable,
 and all the virtue, in the soft dress,
 cheerful and pleasant,
 direct in truth be fair path;
 nor blush to own religion sovereign sway. 
just of thy word — as to the hope thou give,
 Elgin, farewell,
 go, reap the pleasure of a well spend life. 
friend of my youth,
 accept the tribute of a sacred tear
 due to thy gentle shade.
