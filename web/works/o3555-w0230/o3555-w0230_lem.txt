verse on mrs. Rowe.

such be the note our chaster Sappho sing,
 and every muse drop honey on her tongue. 
bless shade! how pure a breath of praise be thy,
 who spotless life be faultless as thy line:
 in who each worth and every grace conspire,
 the christian meekness and the poet fire. 
learnt without pride, a woman without art;
 the sweet manner and the gentle heart. 
smooth like her verse her passion learn to move,
 and her whole soul be harmony and love:
 virtue that breast without a conflict gain,
 and easy like a native monarch reign. 
on earth still favour as by heaven approve,
 the world applaud, and Alexis love. 
with love, with health, with fame, and friendship bless,
 and of a cheerful heart the constant feast,
 what more of bliss sincere can earth bestow? 
what pure heaven can angel taste below? 
but bliss from earth vain scene too quick fly;
 the golden chord be break, Alexis die. 
now in the leafy shade, and widow grove,
 sad Philomela mourn her absent love. 
now deep retire in frome enchant vale,
 she pour her tuneful sorrow on the gale;
 without one fond reserve the world disclaim,
 and give up all her soul to heavenly flame. 
yet in no useless gloom she wear her day;
 she love the work, and only shun the praise. 
her pious hand the poor, the mourner bless;
 her image live in every kindred breast. 
thynn, Carteret, Blackmore, orrery approve,
 and prior praise, and noble Hertford love;
 seraphic Kenn, and tuneful Watts be thy,
 and virtue noble champion fill the line. 
bless in thy friendship! in thy death too bless! 
Receiv'd without a pang to endless rest. 
heaven call the saint mature by length of day,
 and her pure spirit be exhale in praise. 
bright pattern of thy sex, be thou my muse;
 thy gentle sweetness through my soul diffuse:
 let i thy palm, though not thy laurel share,
 and copy thou in charity and prayer. 
though for the bard my line be yet too faint,
 yet in my life let i transcribe the saint.
