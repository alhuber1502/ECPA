The EXCEPTION.

STANHOPE has gain'd one branch of fame,
To which, I'll prove, he has no claim.
Say they â€” "His favours he extends,
"Without regard to wealth, or friends:
"Of such disinterested spirit,
"Nothing prevails, with him, but merit;
"Nay, he'll dispense with merit too,
"When modest want can reach his view. "

Mere prejudice! 'tis plain to me,
No man takes sweeter bribes than he.
To clear this point from any doubt,
A parallel shall help me out.

The noble FULVIA spurns at gain:
Freely she heals her lover's pain:
But, surely, you'll allow me this,
That when she grants, she shares the bliss.

So STANHOPE, in each gen'rous action,
Reaps more than half the satisfaction.
