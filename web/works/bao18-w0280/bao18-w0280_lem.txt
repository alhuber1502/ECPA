to a maniac.

there be a time, poor phrensy maid,
 when i can over thy grief have mourn,
 and still with tear the tale repay
 of sense by sorrow sway overturn. 

but now thy state my envy move:
 for thou be woe unconscious prize;
 thy heart no sense of suffering prove,
 no fruitless tear bedew thy eye. 

excess of sorrow, kind to thou,
 at once destroy thy reason power;
 but reason still remain to i,
 and only bid i grieve the more.
