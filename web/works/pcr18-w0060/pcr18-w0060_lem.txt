reflection upon the subject — —

when all the fierce passion cease
 (the glory and disgrace of youth);
 when the delude soul, in peace,
 can listen to the voice of truth;
 when we be teach in who to trust,
 and how to spare, to spend, to give,
 (our prudence kind, our pity just,)
 it be then we right learn to live. 

its weakness when the body feel,
 nor danger in contempt defy;
 to reason when desire appeal,
 when, on experience, hope relief;
 when every pass hour we prize,
 nor rash on our folly spend;
 but use it, as it quick fly,
 with sober aim to serious end;
 when prudence bound our utmost view,
 and bid we wrath and wrong forgive;
 when we can calm gain or lose, —
 it be then we right learn to live. 

yet thus, when we our way discern,
 and can upon our care depend,
 to travel safe, when we learn,
 behold! we be near our journey end
 we have tread the maze of error round,
 long wander in the wind glade;
 and, now the torch of truth be find,
 it only show we where we stray:
 light for ourselves, what be it worth,
 when we no more our way can choose? 
for other, when we hold it forth,
 they, in their pride, the boon refuse. 

by long experience teach, we now
 can right judge of friend and foe,
 can all the worth of these allow,
 and all their fault discern in those;
 relentless hatred, err love,
 we can for sacred truth forgo;
 we can the warm friend reprove,
 and bear to praise the fierce foe:
 to what effect? our friend be go
 beyond reproof, regard, or care;
 and of our foe remain there one,
 the mild relent thought to share? 

now it be our boast that we can quell
 the wild passion in their rage;
 can their destructive force repel,
 and their impetuous wrath assuage:
 Ah! virtue, do thou arm, when now
 this bold rebellious race be flee;
 when all these tyrant rest, and thou
 be war with the mighty dead? 
revenge, ambition, scorn, and pride,
 and strong desire, and fierce disdain,
 the giant-brood by thou defy,
 lo! time be resistless stroke have slay. 

yet time, who can that race subdue,
 (overpower strength, appease rage,)
 leave yet a persevere crew,
 to try the fail power of age. 
vex by the constant call of these,
 virtue awhile for conquest try;
 but weary grow and fond of ease,
 she make with they a compromise:
 avarice himself she give to rest,
 but rule he with her strict command,
 bid pity touch his torpid breast,
 and justice hold his eager hand. 

yet be there nothing man can do,
 when chill age come creep on? 
can we yet some good pursue? 
be talent bury? genius go? 
if passion slumber in the breast,
 if folly from the heart be flee;
 of laurel let we go in quest,
 and place they on the poet head. 

yes, we will redeem the waste time,
 and to neglect study flee;
 we will build again the lofty rhyme,
 or live, philosophy, with thou:
 for reason clear, for flight sublime,
 eternal fame reward shall be;
 and to what glorious height we will climb,
 the admire crowd shall envy see. 

begin the song! begin the theme! —
 alas! and be invention dead? 
dream we no more the golden dream? 
be memory with her treasure flee? 
yes, it be too late, — now reason guide
 the mind, sole judge in all debate;
 and thus the important point decide,
 for laurel, it be, alas! too late. 
what be possess we may retain,
 but for new conquest strive in vain. 

beware then, age, that what be win,
 if life past labour, study, view,
 be lose not, now the labour do,
 when all thy part be, — not to lose:
 when thou can toil or gain no more,
 destroy not what be gain before. 

for, all that be gain of all that be good,
 when time shall his weak frame destroy
 (their use then right understand),
 shall man, in happy state, enjoy. 
Oh! argument for truth divine,
 for study care, for virtue strife;
 to know the enjoyment will be thy,
 in that renew, that endless life!
