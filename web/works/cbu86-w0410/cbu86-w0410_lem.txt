[epitaph] for the author father.

o you who cheek the tear of pity stain,
 draw near with pious reverence and attend! 
here lie the love husband dear remains,
 the tender father, and the generous friend. 

the pity heart that feel for human woe;
 the dauntless heart that fear no human pride;
 the friend of man, to vice alone a foe;
 'for even his fail lean to virtue side. '
