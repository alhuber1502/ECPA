[EPITAPH] FOR THE AUTHOR'S FATHER.

O ye whose cheek the tear of pity stains,
 Draw near with pious rev'rence and attend! 
Here lie the loving Husband's dear remains,
 The tender Father, and the gen'rous Friend. 

The pitying Heart that felt for human Woe;
 The dauntless heart that fear'd no human Pride;
 The Friend of Man, to vice alone a foe;
 'For ev'n his failings lean'd to Virtue's side. '
