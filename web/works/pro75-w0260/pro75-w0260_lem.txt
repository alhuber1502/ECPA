the complaint.

i

you verdant green, you shady wood,
you garden, and you grove,
you tinkle stream, you murmur flood,
you grotto, and alcove.

ii

alas! you yield i no delight,
in sigh i waste the day,
in tear consume the tedious night,
for Strephon be away.

iii

how often his persuasive tongue,
beguile the fleet day,
when tender strain he sweet sing,
in leonora praise.

iv

how sweet fly the time away,
how blithe be every hour,
when i with Strephon past the day,
at yonder bloom bower.

v

his auburn tress careless grow,
in ringlet round his neck,
his lovely eye of glossy blue,
and smile rosy cheek.

vi

his graceful mein, and gentle look,
with skin as lily fair,
bedeck with garland, pipe and crook,
none can with he compare.

vii

as through the dale, or in the grove,
together we do go,
he tell i pretty tale of love,
and i believe they true.

viii

but now he be go, and i must grieve,
for ever i must mourn,
out of his sight i can live,
and fear he will never return.

ix

in shady bower, and mossy cell,
forlorn and lose i stray,
by crystal stream, and purl rill,
i waste the live-long day.

x

when absent from the youth i love,
my breast be fraught with pain,
no comfort can my bosom prove,
each shepherd i disdain.

xi

for Strephon be the pride of swain,
his worth by all approve,
i hear his sweet melodious strain,
i hear and fond love.

xii

you careless nymph, so blithe and gay,
your choice with caution make,
let no false swain your heart betray,
for leonora sake.
