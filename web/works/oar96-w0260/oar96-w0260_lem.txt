paraphrase on Cant.  5. 6.  etc.  

oh! how his point language, like a dart,
 stick to the soft fibre of my heart,
 quite through my soul the charm accent slide,
 that from his life inspire portal glide;
 and while i the enchant sound admire,
 my melt vital in a trance expire. 
oh son of Venus, mourn thy baffle art,
 for i defy the proud of thy dart:
 undazzled now, i thy weak taper view,
 and find no fatal influence accrue;
 nor will fond child thy feeble lamp appear,
 shall my bright sun deign to approach more near;
 can thou his rival then pretend to prove? 
thou a false idol, he the god of love;
 lovely beyond conception, he be all
 reason, or fancy amiable call,
 all that the most exert thought can reach,
 when sublimate to its utmost streach. 
oh! altogether charm, why in thou
 do the vain world no form or beauty see? 
why do they idolise a dusty clod,
 and yet refuse their homage to a god? 
why from a beauteous flow fountain turn,
 for the dead puddle of a narrow urn? 
oh carnal madness! sure we false call
 so dull a thing as man be, rational;
 alas, my shine love, what can there be
 on earth so splendid to out-glitter thou? 
in who the brightness of a godhead shine,
 with all its lovely and endear line;
 thou with who light mortality once bless,
 will throw off its dark veil to be possess;
 then altogether lovely, why in thou
 do the vain world no form or beauty see.
