sonnet [24] xxiv. by the same.

make there my tomb beneath the lime trees shade,
 where grass and flower, in wild luxuriance wave;
 let no memorial mark where i be lay,
 or point to common eye the lover grave! 
but oft at twilight morn, or close day,
 the faithful friend, with falter step shall glide,
 tribute of fond regret by stealth to pay,
 and sigh over the unhappy suicide! 
and sometime, when the sun with part ray
 gild the long grass that hide my silent bed,
 the tear shall tremble in my charlotte eye;
 dear, precious drop! they shall embalm the dead;
 yes! Charlotte over the mournful spot shall weep,
 where her poor Werter, and his sorrow â€” sleep.
