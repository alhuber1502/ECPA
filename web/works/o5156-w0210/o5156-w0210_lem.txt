the extent of cookery.

when Tom to Cambridge first be send,
a plain brown bob he wear;
read much, and look as though he mean
to be a fop no more.

see he to lincoln's-inn repair,
his resolution flag;
he cherish a length of hair,
and tuck it in a bag. 

nor coke nor salkield he regard,
but get into the house;
and soon a judge rank reward
his pliant vote and bow.

adieu the bob! you bag give place!
full-bottom come instead!
good lord! to see the various way
of dress â€” a calve head!
