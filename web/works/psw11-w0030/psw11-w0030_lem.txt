lady B— B— find in the author room some verse unfinished, underwritten a stanza of her own, with raillery upon he, which give occasion to this ballad. 

august, 1702. 

to the tune of the cutpurse.

once on a time, as old story rehearse,
 a Fryer will needs show his talent in latin;
 but be sore put to it in the midst of a verse,
 because he can find no word to come pat in. 
then all in the place
 he leave a void space,
 and so go to bed in a desperate case. 
when, behold the next morning, a wonderful riddle,
 he find it be strange fill in the middle.

let censure critic then think what they list on it,
 who will not write verse with such a assistant.

this put i the Fryar into a amazement,
 for he wise consider it must be a sprite,
 that come through the keyhole, or in at the casement,
 and it need must be one that can both read and write:
 yet he do not know
 if it be friend or foe,
 or whether it come from above or below. 
however it be civil in angel or elf,
 for he never can have fill it so well of himself.

iii.

even so master doctor have puzzle his brain
 in make a ballad, but be at a stand,
 he have mix little wit with a great deal of pain,
 when he find a new help from invisible hand. 
then good dr. s
 pay thanks for the gift,
 for you free must own you be at a dead lift;
 and though some malicious young spirit do do it,
 you may know by the hand, it have not cleave foot.

let censure critic then think what they list on it,
 who will not write verse with such a assistant.
