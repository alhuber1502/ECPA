An Inscription wrote on the Monument of a Young and Beautiful Lady.

IN Death's great library here laid aside
 This volume lies neglected and despis'd,
 Yet rests in hope, by heav'nly art apply'd,
 To re-appear, corrected and revis'd,
 Improv'd by its first Author's perfect hand,
 In Heav'n's fair catalogue it firm shall stand,
