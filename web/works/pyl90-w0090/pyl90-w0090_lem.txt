a inscription write on the monument of a young and beautiful lady.

in death great library here lay aside
 this volume lie neglect and despise,
 yet rest in hope, by heavenly art apply,
 to reappear, correct and revise,
 improve by its first author perfect hand,
 in heaven fair catalogue it firm shall stand,
