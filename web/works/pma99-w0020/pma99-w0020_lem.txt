write on new year day.

do not, my soul, each circle year
 remind i that i must appear
 before my heavenly king,
 in who bless fight man long age
 be but a momentary stage,
 that flit on swift wing? 

then say, thou pure, thou heaven-born fire,
 why do thou not with fond desire
 subdue this inward fear? 
so may i with aspire mind
 press on, nor cast a look behind,
 nor sigh to linger here. 

my will most free i resign
 to thou, my judge, oh! make it thy
 in word, in deed, in thought:
 so shall i find contentment here,
 nor shrink from death, though death draw near
 with all his terror fraught. 

no sting in death but sin be find,
 and since our god have heal that wound,
 what have we here to dread? 
it be we to praise he and obey,
 look up to he from day today,
 to give we heavenly bread. 

teach i to wait with humble trust,
 to hope the best, nor fear the worst
 in this life vary round;
 and when i meet misfortune blow,
 teach i submission, that may show
 on what my joy i find. 

oh then vouchsafe thy heavenly aid
 to lead i through the gloomy shade
 of worldly grief and care;
 support by thy foster hand,
 let i temptation lure withstand,
 and chace away despair. 

thus shall you pass serene over,
 you circle year, while i implore
 the god, who give i breath,
 to lead i on from day to day
 secure in virtue holy way,
 resign to life or death.
