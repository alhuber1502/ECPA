to adversity.

hail, pallid nymph, with downcast eye,
 with sable garb, and head recline,
 severe kind adversity,
 preceptress of the thoughtless mind! 

it be thy to draw dark error veil
 from the delude eye of youth;
 to teach the heart of pride to feel,
 and lead the wanderer to truth. 

though venal flattery and deceit
 never offer incense at thy shrine,
 pity still seek thy lone retreat,
 and real friendship still be thy. 
for, as pure gold by fire we prove,
 adversity the test of love.
