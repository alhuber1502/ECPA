the wish.

by the same.

how short be life uncertain space!
alas! how quick do!
how swift the wild precarious chace!
and yet how difficult the race!
how very hard to run!

youth stop at first its wilful ear
to wisdom prudent voice;
till now arrive to riper year,
experience age wear out with care
repent its early choice.
what though its prospect now appear
so please and refine;
yet groundless hope, and anxious fear,
by turn the busy moment share,
and prey upon the mind.

since then false joy our fancy cheat
with hope of real bliss;
you guardian power that rule my fate,
the only wish that i create,
be all comprise in this.

may i through life uncertain tide,
be still from pain exempt;
may all my want be still supply,
my state too low to admit of pride,
and yet above contempt.

but shall your providence divine
a great bliss intend;
may all those blessing you design,
(if ever those blessing shall be mine)
be centre in a friend.
