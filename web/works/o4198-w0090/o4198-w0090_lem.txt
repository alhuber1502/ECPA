to miss h—l—d. with a present.

1768. 

accept, fair nymph, this token of my love,
 nor look disdainful on the prostrate Swain;
 by every sacred oath; i will constant prove,
 and act as worthy for to wear your chain. 

not with more constant ardour shall the sun
 chase the faint shadow of the night away;
 nor shall he on his course more constant run,
 and cheer the universe with come day,

than i in please chain of conquest bind,
 adore the charm author of my smart; —
 for ever will i thy sweet charm resound,
 and paint the fair possessor of my heart.
