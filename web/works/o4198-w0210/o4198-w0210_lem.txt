Colin instruct.

1770. 

young Colin be as stout a boy
 as ever give a maiden joy;
 but long in vain he tell his tale
 to black-eyed Biddy of the Dale. 

ah why the whine shepherd cry,
 be i alone your smile deny,
 i only tell in vain my tale
 to black-eyed Biddy of the Dale. 

true Colin, say the laugh dame,
 you only whimper out your flame,
 other do more than sigh their tale
 to black-eyed Biddy of the Dale.
