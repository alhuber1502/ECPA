COLIN INSTRUCTED.

1770.

YOUNG Colin was as stout a boy
 As ever gave a Maiden joy;
 But long in vain he told his tale
 To black-eyed Biddy of the Dale. 

Ah why the whining Shepherd cried,
 Am I alone your smiles denied,
 I only tell in vain my tale
 To black-eyed Biddy of the Dale. 

True Colin, said the laughing Dame,
 You only whimper out your flame,
 Others do more than sigh their tale
 To black-eyed Biddy of the Dale.
