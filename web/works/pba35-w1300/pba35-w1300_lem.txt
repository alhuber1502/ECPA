to lady hâ€”r, who ask, have the author do write verse?

tell i, my patroness, and friend,
 can age parnassian height ascend? 
sweet poesy light footstep trace? 
ah no! i must give up the chace:
 when time the head have silvered over,
 the dear delusion charm no more. 

but why have thou, with taste endow,
 at phoebus altar never bow? 
shall book engross thou all the day? 
when, lo! he wait to grace thy lay.
