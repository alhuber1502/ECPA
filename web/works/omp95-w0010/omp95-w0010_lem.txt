to the king, a ode, etc. 

on mary tomb, thrô roll year,
 the mournful grace all shall weep;
 and, with fresh lamp and flow tear,
 the virtue endless vigil keep. 

for MARY distant land shall mourn
 when late record her deed relate,
 age to come, and man unborn,
 shall bless her name, and sigh her fate. 

fair Albion shall with watchful trust,
 her holy queen sad relic guard,
 till heaven awake the precious dust,
 to cloth it in its full reward. 

but let the king forsake his woe,
 reflect on his fair renown;
 and take the cypress from his brow,
 to put his wonted laurel on. 

the lovely dead, who he regret,
 can know no fear, can feel no grief:
 the live world, who he forget,
 will perish without his relief. 

in vain the british Lyons roar,
 while press by grief their monarch stoop;
 the belgic dart will wound no more,
 if he, who hand sustain they, droop:

embattle prince wait their chief,
 who voice shall rule, who arm shall lead;
 and, in kind murmur, chide that grief
 which hinder europe being free. 

the great example they demand
 who still to conquest lead the way,
 and wish he present to command,
 as they stand ready to obey. 

they seek that joy which use to glow
 expand on the hero face,
 when the thick squadron press the foe,
 and WILLIAM lead the glorious chase. 

oh! give the mourn nation joy,
 break forth, great sun, with usual light:
 and let thy strong beam destroy
 those cloud, which keep thou from our sight. 

advance in thy meridian course,
 and, since thy mary light be go,
 rejoice the world with double force,
 thy beam all fix in thou alone. 

see, pious king, with different strife
 thy struggle albion bosom tear;
 so much she fear for william life,
 that mary fate she dare not mourn. 

her fair delight, her soft half,
 cold in the grave with MARY lie,
 unless in thou her strength be safe,
 the fright nation whole die. 

thou, guardian angel, save our land. 
from thy own grief, her fierce foe;
 lest, raise and rescue by thy hand,
 she bend and sink beneath thy woe. 

her former triumph all be vain,
 unless new trophy still be seek;
 and hoary majesty sustain
 the battle which thy youth have fight. 

where now be britain fearful love,
 which make her hate the war alarm? 
where that excess with which she strive
 to keep her hero in her arm? 

while still she chide the come spring,
 which call thou over thy subject sea,
 while, for the safety of the king,
 she wish the victor glory less? 

it be go, it be change; sad Britain now
 hasten her lord to foreign war:
 happy if toil may break his woe,
 or danger may divert his care. 

in martial sound she drown her sigh,
 lest he the rise grief shall hear. 
she pull her helmet over her eye,
 lest he shall see the fall tear. 

go, mighty prince, let FRANCE be teach
 how constant mind by grief be try,
 how great the land, that weep and fight,
 when WILLIAM lead, and MARY die. 

fierce in the battle make it know,
 where death with all her dart be see,
 that she can strike thy heart with none,
 but that with which she strike the queen. 

thy virtue, who resistless force
 no dire event can ever stay,
 must carry on its destine course,
 though death and envy stop the way. 

envy shall calm that useless rage,
 by which thy glory bright grow,
 and death, thy sorrow to assuage,
 shall turn her wrath, and wound thy foe. 

belgia indulge her open grief,
 while yet her master be not near,
 she hate hope, she scorn relief,
 and triumph, proud in full despair. 

her echo wail pierce the sky,
 to earth her bend forehead bow,
 the tear unbounded from her eye,
 as water from her sluice, flow. 

but soon as thou her lord return,
 her head be rear, her eye be dry,
 she smile as WILLIAM never have mourn,
 she look as MARY never have die. 

that freedom which all sorrow claim
 she do for thy content resign:
 her piety it self will blame,
 if her regret shall waken thy. 

dissemble ease, and force joy,
 she beg her lord his tear to dry:
 do belgia ever her prayer employ,
 and orange stand regardless by? 

to cure thy woe she show thy fame,
 lest the great mourner shall forget
 that all the race whence orange come,
 make virtue triumph over fate. 

WILLIAM his country have cause can fight,
 and with his blood its freedom seal:
 Maurice and HENRY guard that right
 for which their pious father fall. 

a second william bloom can tell
 how hero rise, how patriot set:
 as they do other deed excel,
 excel they be thy complete. 

the last fair instance thou must give
 whence nassau virtue can be try;
 and show the world that thou can live
 as glorious as thy MARY die. 

that thou can live for belgia's sake,
 pierce by her grief forget thy own;
 new toil endure, new conquest make
 to give her ease, though thou have none. 

to keep from treacherous foe her store,
 though all thy wealth be rob by death;
 to vanquish, though she live no more
 who hand prepare the victor wreathe. 

oh, can thy grief obdurate prove
 to belgia's cry, to britain fear,
 yet let they yield to mary love,
 to nassau glory join in she. 

if MARY can so well command,
 it be by long obey thou;
 her sceptre, guide by thy hand,
 preserve the isle and rule the sea. 

but oh! it be little that her life
 thy fame over earth and water bear,
 in death it be worthy william wife
 to fix his name amid the star. 

beyond where matter move, or place
 receive its form, thy virtue roll:
 from mary glory angel trace
 the beauty of her partner soul. 

wise fate, which do its heaven decree
 to hero, when they yield their breath,
 hasten thy triumph, half of thou
 be deify before thy death. 

and to thy fame alone it be give
 unbounded thrô all world to go,
 while MARY reign a saint in heaven,
 and thou a demi-god below.
