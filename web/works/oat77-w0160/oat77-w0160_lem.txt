dear!

Laur.

take —

Alex.

what?

Laur.

a kiss.

Alex.

what mean this unexpected bliss,
a bliss which i so oft in vain
have crave, and now unasked obtain?

Laur.

when to my Swain reserve i seem,
i love he, kiss he less esteem! 

Alex.

dear nymph, your female art forbear,
nor fond thus new gin prepare
for one already catch i'th'snare.
you may impose a heavy chain,
but none that sure will retain.
it be Laura, a unjust design
to treat so plain a soul as i
with oracle; with mystic sense
religion may perhaps dispense,
but these aenigma mar love joy,
as cloud gem in their worth destroy.

Laur.

then take it on your peril Swain,
(since you compel i to be plain)
the kiss i give you be in lieu
of all love-debt from Laura due,
to Swain Alexis, since the hour
of our first entrance on amour. 

Alex.

what crime can i have wrought enforce
this sudden and severe divorce?
it be, sure, impossible such guilt
shall press my soul and not be feel. 

Laur.

recall false Shepheard what to day
i hear you to dorinda say.
you say she do noon light outshine,
more than the paphian queen divine.
you vow respect to her command,
and (heaven forgive you) kiss her hand.

Alex.

you wrong i nymph, by Pan you do;
for if that courtship you review,
you will find it be complement to you.

Laur.

yes, i be Sov'rainly respect
by prayer to another saint direct.

Alex.

dorindas grace, it be well know,
bear such resemblance with your own,
that when i make my late address,
it be in that gentle shepherdess
the sweetness of those charm to taste,
which so divine Laura grace.

Laur.

weak nymph with man contend in vain,
who thus can their default maintain.
wise nature have her care express,
that neither sex shall be oppress;
for when to we she do commit
tyrannic beauty, she think fit
to teach man wit and art to allay
and temper beauty absolute sway.
