[martial] Lib. xi. Epigr. xliii.

there be not a drowsy alderman i'th'town,
but i'l engage more noble shall requite
dull hobble Meeter on his beard and gown,
than you the most elaborate line i write.

and yet your worship still give i strict charge
to write in honour of your patronage;
and that my thought upon the theam be large,
and favour of the smartness of the age. 
troth sir, you have less conscience than a Turk,
to put a honest muse on conjure work,
to make Wesphalia ham of english pork.
