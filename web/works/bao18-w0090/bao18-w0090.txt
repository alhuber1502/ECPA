SONG.

WAS it for this I dearly loved thee? .... 
But since at length I know thy heart,
 And learn no real passion moved thee,
 Go, Henry, go; this hour we part. 

But do not think, past love forgetting,
 That I thy foe can ever be;
 My blighted hopes howe'er regretting,
 I still shall pray for bliss to thee. 

I still, no wrongs from thee resenting,
 Shall wish Love's choicest treasures thine;
 Though till life's closing sigh lamenting
 The power to bless thee was not mine.
