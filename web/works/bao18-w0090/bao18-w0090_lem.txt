song.

be it for this i dear love thou? .... 
but since at length i know thy heart,
 and learn no real passion move thou,
 go, Henry, go; this hour we part. 

but do not think, past love forget,
 that i thy foe can ever be;
 my blight hope however regret,
 i still shall pray for bliss to thou. 

i still, no wrong from thou resent,
 shall wish love choice treasure thy;
 though till life close sigh lament
 the power to bless thou be not i.
