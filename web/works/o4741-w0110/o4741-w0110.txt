To a Young LADY, who had a CUPID given Her.

FAIR Lady, take a special Care,
 This pleasing Toy become no Snare;
 The subtle God is full of Wiles,
 And mischiefs most, when most he smiles:
 Beware to clasp him in your Arms,
 Nor gaze too much upon his Charms;
 Lest in a borrow'd Shape he wound,
 As once unhappy DIDO found;
 For, while she view'd his smiling Look,
 Her Heart receiv'd a fatal Stroke.
