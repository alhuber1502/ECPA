to a young lady, who have a Cupid give Her. 

fair lady, take a special care,
 this please toy become no snare;
 the subtle god be full of wile,
 and mischief most, when most he smile:
 beware to clasp he in your arm,
 nor gaze too much upon his charm;
 lest in a borrow shape he wind,
 as once unhappy Dido find;
 for, while she view his smile look,
 her heart receive a fatal stroke.
