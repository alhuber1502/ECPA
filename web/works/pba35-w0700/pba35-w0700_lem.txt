a letter write from London to mrs. Strangeways Horner, who the author have leave the day before at tunbridge-well.

oct. 1730. 

say, my Hortensia, in this silent hour,
 when the pale queen of night exert her power,
 what guardian-angel on thy slumber wait,
 to paint the glory of thy future state;
 to show what mansion, in the realm divine,
 be set apart for soul, refine as thy? 
though thither, winge with hope, thy virtue soar,
 late, very late, may thou those realm explore! 

Adas! i leave thou sick: o shame to tell! 
i shall have stay to see Hortensia well:
 but dire necessity, relentless, sway;
 she, stern, enjoin, unwilling i obey. 
tear from thy sight, how have i drag the day ,
which, in thy presence, fly too swift away! 
how shall i pass the melancholy night? 
when will the post arrive, and give delight? 
of thy return health when shall i hear? 
fain will i hope, though quite depress with fear. 

o power supreme! yet, yet, Hortensia spare;
 the stranger, and the wretched, be her care:
 snatch she not hence; we can let she go;
 still let she be thy substitute below,
 to raise the sink heart, to heal distress;
 to she be give the will and power to bless. 

o will heaven grant i, ere i cross the main,
 to see thy face, Hortensia, once again! 
but i must hasten to hibernia shore;
 and never, never, shall behold thou more.
