the silver crown.

and you shall walk in silk attire,
 and silver have to spare,
 gin you will consent to be his bride,
 nor think of Donald more. 
o who will have buy a silken go
 with a poor break heart! 
or what be to i a silver crown,
 gin from my love i part! 

the mind who be every wish be pure
 far dear be to i;
 and ere i be force to break my faith
 i will lay i down and die! 
for i have pledge my virgin troth
 brave Donald fate to share;
 and he have give to i his heart,
 with all its virtue rare. 

his gentle manner win my heart,
 he grateful take the gift;
 can i but think to seek it back
 it will have be worse than theft! 
for long life can never repay
 the love he bear to i;
 and ere i be force to break my troth
 i will lay i down and die.
