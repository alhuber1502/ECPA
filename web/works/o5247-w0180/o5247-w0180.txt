An ODE, IN IMITATION of SAPHO. 

I.

ME the loveliest truest Swain,
 Often woo's, but woo's in vain;
 Tender, soft, beseeching Eyes,
 Pleading Tears, and melting Sighs:
 Such soft Pains as Lovers feel,
 Such his dying Looks reveal. 

II.

Yet by Pride, by Shame with-held,
 Every yielding Thought's repell'd:
 Scarce the Sigh that heaves my Breast,
 Scarce the falling Tear's represt:
 Yet may artful Tongue denies
 My Love, and contradicts my Eyes. 

III.

If then, charming Youth, you'd know
 All my Love, and all my Woe;
 All my Heart, without Disguise,
 Read it in my artless Eyes. 
They'll in tender Language tell
 What I wou'd in vain conceal. 

IV.

There each yielding Thought betray'd,
 All my Hopes and Fears display'd:
 The soft Flame which warms my Breast,
 In each melting Look's confest:
 While unstudied Glances prove,
 All is Truth, and all is Love.
