song.

since Colin appear on our plain,
our village be happy and gay;
his presence enliven the year,
and winter be please as may.

though he live the delight of the fair,
no envy their bosom alarm;
his good-nature so flatter they all,
each maid think he win by her charm.

but i, though so friendless and poor,
he say be the choice of his heart;
and sure i shall trust in a swain,
who never descend to art.

i speak of the bell of the town,
i tell he how handsome they be;
but merit the shepherd admire,
and he fancy he find it in i.

how much then to Colin i owe,
each action of life shall impart;
while it speak in the glance of my eye,
it shall live in the wish of my heart.

i will rise with the break of the dawn,
and neat shall our cottage be see,
in summer, how fragrant and gay,
in winter, so warm and so clean.
