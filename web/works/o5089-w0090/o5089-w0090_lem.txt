the cit country-box, 1757. 

by ROBERT Lloyd, a.m. 

the wealthy cit, grow old in trade,
 now wish for the rural shade,
 and buckle to his one-horse chair,
 old Dobbin, or the founder mare;
 while wedge in close by his side,
 sit madam, his unwieldy bride,
 with Jacky on a stool before they,
 and out they jog in due decorum. 
scarce past the turnpike half a mile,
 how all the country seem to smile! 
and as they slow jog together,
 the cit commend the road and weather;
 while madam dote upon the tree,
 and long for every house she see,
 admire its view, its situation,
 and thus she open her oration. 

what signify the load of wealth;
 without that rich jewel, health? 
excuse the fondness of a wife,
 who dote upon your precious life! 
such easeless toil, such constant care,
 be more than human strength can bear. 
one may observe it in your face —
 indeed, my dear, you break apace:
 and nothing can your health repair,
 but exercise, and country air. 
sir traffic have a house, you know,
 about a mile from cheney-row:
 he be a good man, indeed it be true,
 but not so warm, my dear, as you:
 and folk be always apt to sneer —
 one will not be outdo, my dear! 

sir traffic name so well apply
 awake his brother merchant pride;
 and thrifty, who have all his life
 pay utmost deference to his wife,
 confess her argument have reason,
 and by the approach summer season,
 draw a few hundred from the stock,
 and purchase his country box. 

some three or four mile out of town,
 (a hour ride will bring you down,)
 he fix on his choice abode,
 not half a furlong from the road:
 and so convenient do it lay,
 the stage pass it every day:
 and then so snug, so mighty pretty,
 to have a house so near the city! 
take but your place at the boar
 you be set down at the very door. 

well then, suppose they fix at last,
 whitewash, paint, scrub past,
 hug themselves in ease and clover,
 with all the fuss of move over;
 lo, a new heap of whim be breed! 
and wanton in my lady head. 

well to be sure, it must be own,
 it be a charm spot of ground;
 so sweet a distance for a ride,
 and all about so countrify! 
it will come to but a trifle price
 to make it quite a paradise;
 i can bear those nasty rail,
 those ugly break mouldy pale:
 suppose, my dear, instead of these,
 we build a rail, all Chinese,
 although one hate to be expose,
 it be dismal to be thus enclose;
 one hardly any object see —
 i wish you will fell those odious tree. 
object continual pass by
 be something to amuse the eye,
 but to be pen within the wall —
 one might as well be at saint Paul. 
our house beholder will adore,
 be there a level lawn before,
 nothing its view to incommode,
 but quite lay open to the road;
 while every traveler in amaze,
 shall on our little mansion gaze,
 and point to the choice retreat,
 cry, that be sir thrifty country seat. 

no doubt her argument prevail,
 for madam taste can never fail. 

bless age! when all man may procure
 the title of a connoisseur;
 when noble and ignoble herd
 be govern by a single word;
 though, like the royal german dame,
 it bear a hundred christian name;
 as genius, fancy, judgement, goût,
 whim, caprice, je-ne scai-quoi, virtù:
 which appellation all describe
 taste, and the modern tasteful tribe. 

now bricklayer, carpenter, and joiner,
 with Chinese artist, and designer,
 produce their scheme of alteration,
 to work this wondrous reformation. 
the useful dome, which secret stand,
 embosomed in the yew-tree wood,
 the traveler with amazement see
 a temple, gothic, or Chinese,
 with many a bell, and tawdry rag on,
 and crest with a sprawl dragon;
 a wooden arch be bend astride
 a ditch of water, four foot wide,
 with angle, curve, and zigzag line,
 from halfpenny exact design. 
in front, a level lawn be see,
 without a shrub upon the green,
 where taste will want its first great law,
 but for the skulk, sly ha-ha,
 by who miraculous assistance,
 you gain a prospect two field distance. 
and now from Hyde-Park corner come
 the god of Athens, and of Rome. 
here squabby cupid take their place,
 with Venus, and the clumsy grace:
 Apollo there, with aim so clever,
 stretch his leaden bow for ever;
 and there, without the power to fly,
 stand fix a tiptoe mercury. 

the villa thus complete grace,
 all own, that thrifty have a taste;
 and madam female friend, and cousin,
 with common-councilman, by dozen,
 flock every Sunday to the feat,
 to stare about they, and to eat.
