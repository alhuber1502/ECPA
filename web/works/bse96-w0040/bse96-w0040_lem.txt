HERVA,

at the tomb of argantyr. a runic dialogue. 

HERVA. 

argantyr, wake! — to thou i call,
 hear from thy dark sepulchral hall! 
 amid the forest inmost gloom,
 thy daughter, circle thrice thy tomb,
 with mystic rite of thrill power
 disturb thou at this midnight hour! 
i, thy sauserlama child,
 of my filial right beguile,
 now adjure thou to resign
 the charm sword, by birthright mine! 
when the dwarf, on eyvor plain,
 dim glide by thy marriage-train,
 in jeweled belt of gorgeous pride,
 to thy pale and tremble bride,
 give he not, in whisper deep,
 that dread companion of thy sleep? —
 fall before its edge thy foe,
 idle do it now repose
 in the dark tomb with thou? — awake! 
spell thy sullen slumber break! 
now their stern command fulfil! 
warrior, be thou silent still? —
 or be my gross sense find
 deaf to the low sepulchral sound? —
 hervardor, — hiarvardor, — hear! 
HRANI, amid thy slumber drear! 
spirit of a dauntless race,
 in armor clad, your tomb i trace. 
now, with sharp and blood-stained spear,
 accent shrill, and spell severe,
 i wake you all from slumber mute,
 beneath the dark oak twist root! —
 be andgrym hate son no more
 that sleep the sword, that drink their gore? —
 live, — why, to magic rhyme,
 speak no voice of former time,
 low as over your tomb i bend
 to hear the expect sound ascend,
 murmur from your darksome hall,
 at a virgin solemn call? —
 hervardor, — hiarvardor, — hear! 
HRANI, — mark my spell severe! 
henceforth may the semblance cold,
 that do each warrior spirit hold,
 parch, as corpse unblest, that lie
 wither in the sultry sky! —
 ghastly may your form decay,
 hence the noisome reptile prey,
 if you force not, thus adjure,
 my sire to yield the charm sword! 

argantyr. 

arm amid this starless gloom,
 thou, who step adventurous roam;
 thou, that wave a magic spear
 thrice before our mansion drear,
 devote virgin, — know in time
 the mischief of the runic rhyme,
 force accent, mutter deep,
 from the cold reluctant lip! 
i no tender father lay
 entomb beneath a hallow shade;
 it be no friendly voice that give
 the oak, that screen a warrior grave,
 give it, in malignant tone,
 to the blast thunderstone. —
 timeless now these bone decay,
 pervious to the baleful ray
 of the swart star. — amid battle yell
 the charm, the fatal weapon fall
 from my unwary grasp. — a knight
 seize the sword of magic might. 
virgin, of thy spell demand
 his name, — and from his victor hand,
 try if thy intrepid zeal
 may win the all-subduing steel. 

HERVA. 

warrior, — thus, with falsehood wild,
 seek thou to deceive thy child? —
 sure as Odin doom thy fall,
 and hide thou in this silent hall,
 here sleep the sword — pale chief, resign
 that, which be by birthright mine! 
fear thou, spirit of my sire,
 at thy only child desire,
 glorious heritage to yield,
 conquest in the deathful field? 

argantyr. 

dare HERVA, listen yet,
 spare thy heart its long regret! 
why tremble shrink thy mother frame
 when the fatal present come? 
virgin, mark the bode word,
 sullen whisper over the sword! 
it prophesy argantyr foe
 shall rue its prowess; — yet that woe
 great far his race shall feel,
 victim of the cruel steel,
 when, in blood of million dye,
 it arm a ireful fratricide
 maid, no err accent warn; —
 of son to thou, hereafter bear,
 one thy chief shall HYDRECK name,
 dark spirit! — but dear to fame
 shall bloom HIARALMO live. —
 maid, his doom thy mandate give! 
renounce, renounce the dire demand,
 or to thy son; in hydreck hand,
 fatal prove, some future day,
 the charm sword. — disturb it not! — away! 

HERVA. 

argantyr, — hear thy daughter voice,
 spell decree a only choice! 
or, in perturb tomb unblest,
 the silence of sepulchral rest
 shall no more thy sink eye steep,
 close no more thy pallid lip,
 or, ere this night shadow melt,
 i the sword, and gorgeous belt. 

argantyr. 

young maid, — who as of warrior may,
 roam thus to tomb by night,
 in coat of mail, with voice austere,
 wave the corse-awakening spear
 over thy dead ancestor; — offence,
 and danger threaten! — hie thou hence! 

HERVA. 

obey, obey, or sleep no more! 
now my sacred right restore! 
the sword, that joy when foe assail,
 sword, that scorn the rib mail,
 scorn the car, in swift career,
 scorn the helmet, scorn the spear;
 scorn the nerve experience arm;
 argantyr, yield it to my charm! 
it be not well the victor pride,
 with thou in silent tomb to hide;
 thy child, thy only child, demand, —
 reach it with thy wither hand! 

argantyr. 

the death of HIARALMO lie
 beneath this moulder arm! — and rise
 round its edge, the lurid fire,
 hostile to unawed desire. 
hie thou hence, nor mad dare
 the death-denouncing grasp; — beware! 

HERVA. 

not if thousand fire invade
 stream from its angry blade. 
innoxious be the fire that play
 round the corpse, with meteor ray,
 and in these waste hour of night
 silent death-hall dim light;
 yet, glide with consume force,
 undaunted will i meet their course. 

argantyr. 

thou, who awless voice proclaim
 scorn of the sepulchral flame,
 lest their force around thou swell,
 punish thy dare spell,
 and thy mortal form consume,
 HERVA, see! — thy father tomb
 open! — mark, to thou restore,
 rise slow, the baneful sword! —
 see, it meet thy rash desire
 bicker with funereal fire! 

HERVA. 

warrior, now do thou reclaim
 the lustre of thy former fame;
 lo, the sword, a seem brand,
 blaze in thy daughter hand! 
nor perish that hand beneath
 vaporous flame, that round it wreathe,
 gleam along the midnight air,
 illume the forest wide, — and glare
 on the scathe oak! — sepulchral wood,
 thou i quit for field of blood! 
nor will i, on its fateful range,
 this sword, with all its meteor, change
 for the norweyan sceptre. — lo,
 death, and conquest, wait i now! —

argantyr. 

hiaralmo future bane,
 grasp with exultation vain,
 fatal, fatal shall be find
 to thou, and thy, in cureless wound! 
by that wound it be now decree
 hydrek self at length shall bleed! 
Herva, less thy long regret
 have thy chief in combat meet
 andgrym son, with warlike zeal,
 meet they in uncharmed steel. 

HERVA. 

sleep, argantyr, — chief of might,
 through the long, the dreary night;
 nor let strife, and bitter scorn,
 amid herva offspring, yet unborn,
 disturb thou in the tomb! — and mark,
 the spear, that break thy slumber dark,
 round the blast oak i wave,
 that ill protect a warrior grave! 
soon shall its scathe trunk be see
 clothe in shield bark, and green
 as before the vengeful time,
 when, by force of baleful rhyme,
 it shrink amid the forest groan,
 smite by the red thunderstone. 
through the renovate bough,
 guardian of thy deep repose,
 shall the hail no long pour,
 the livid dogstar look no more! 
spirit of the elder dead,
 spell-awaked from slumber dread,
 not to your spear, in martial pride,
 rest by each hero side,
 not to your gore-spotted mail,
 Steely shroud of warrior pale,
 shall, through thousand winter, drain
 drive snow, or drench rain;
 nor, while countless summer beam
 on arid plain, or shrink stream,
 through the widen chink be know
 reptile vile of sultry noon,
 to wind the slimy track abhor! —
 fate be i, since i the sword! 

argantyr. 

Herva, thy the source of woe,
 direful long to all thy foe,
 ere against thy peace it turn,
 and thou thy bleed race shall mourn. 
when extinct the tomb blue fire,
 who light now gleam, and now retire,
 quiver over its edge, forbear
 to touch the venom blade; — beware! 
venom, for the blood prepare
 of twelve brave chief, their dread reward. 
Herva, now thy father tomb. 
slow close! — never presume
 again to breathe, in odin hall,
 shrill, the corse-disturbing call! 

HERVA. 

i go, — for these blue fire infest
 the trouble tomb presumptuous guest;
 as of step profane aware,
 round i, more and more, they glare. —
 hervardor, hiarvardor, — keep
 last slumber! — Hrani sleep! 
and sleep argantyr! — chief of might,
 quiet be your mornless night!
