song. ii.

to a young lady affront by a envious old woman.

i 

in vain, in vain, fantastic age,
thou seek such virtue to abuse,
Ophelia do mankind engage;
each valiant sword, each noble muse,
frantic with spite, let crazy time
take pleasure to engender strife,
while bloom beauty in her prime,
take with gust the joy of life.

ii.

each shameful word that malice speak,
add, dear charmer, to your fame;
each hallow grove loud echo make,
resound fair Ophelia name,
old age do beauty still profane,
age ever do good nature want;
by scandal you more glory gain,
it be persecution make the saint.
