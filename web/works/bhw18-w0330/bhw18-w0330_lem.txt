sonnet

to the white-bird of the tropic.

bird of the tropic! thou, who love to stray
 where thy long pinion sweep the sultry line,
 or mark the bound which torrid beam confine
 by thy avert course, that shun the ray
 oblique, enamour of sublime day:
 oft on yond cliff thy fold plume recline,
 and drop those snowy feather indian twine,
 to crown the warrior brow with honour gay. 
over trackless ocean what impel thy wing? 
do not soft instinct in thy soul prevail? 
no sweet affection to thy bosom cling,
 and bid thou oft thy absent nest bewail? â€”
 yet thou again to that dear spot can spring,
 but i no more my long-lost home shall hail!
