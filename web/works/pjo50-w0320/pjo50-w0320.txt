EXTEMPORE. ON A Drawing of the Countess of HERTFORD's, now Duchess of SOMERSET.

This piece to latest times when shown,
 Hertford, shall dignify your own;
 Where as a visitor you came,
 Just shew'd yourself, and left your name. 
So, Prior says, some years ago,
 Apelles left his name at Co. 
Learn hence, ye Nymphs of Britain's isle,
 How Hertford writes, and mark her style.
