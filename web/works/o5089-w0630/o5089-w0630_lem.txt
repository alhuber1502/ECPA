to the authoress of some line on Strawberry-hill.

by the Hon. Horace Walpole.

mistaken fair one, check thy fancy flight,
 nor let fond poetry misguide thy sight. 
the sweet creation, by thy pencil draw,
 nor real in the fabric, nor the lawn. 
less in the master, be the picture true,
 unlike the portrait, and improve the view. 
a trifle, careless, short-lived writer, he
 nor envy topic can, nor object be. 
nor pasteboard wall, nor mimic tower be fit,
 to exercise her tooth, or delia wit. 
no it be Parnassus do she fancy fill,
 which the kind maid mistake for strawb'ry-hill:
 while modesty persuade she to place
 another on that mount she ought to grace.
