A SUMMER'S WISH.

MY Guardian, bear me on thy downy Wing
 To some cool Shade where infant Flow'rs spring;
 Where on the Trees sweet Hony-suckles blow,
 And ruddy Daisies paint the Ground below:
 Where the shrill Linnet charms the solemn Shade,
 And Zephyrs pant along the cooler Glade,
 Or shake the Bull-rush by a River Side,
 While the gay Sun-beams sparkle on the Tide:
 O for some Grot whose rustick Sides declare,
 Ease, and not Splendor, was the Builder's Care;
 Where Roses spread their unaffected Charms,
 And the curl'd Vine extends her clasping Arms;
 Where happy Silence lulls the quiet Soul,
 And makes it calm as Summer Waters roll. 
Here let me learn to check each growing Ill,
 And bring to Reason disobedient Will;
 To watch this incoherent Breast, and find
 What fav'rite Passions rule the giddy Mind. 

Here no Reproaches grate the wounded Ear;
 We see delighted, and transported hear,
 While the glad Warblers wanton round the Trees,
 And the still Waters catch the dying Breeze,
 Grief waits without, and melancholy Gloom:
 Come, chearful Hope, and fill the vacant Room;
 Come ev'ry Thought, which Virtue gave to please;
 Come smiling Health with thy Companion Ease:
 Let these, and all that Virtue's self attends,
 Bless the still Hours of my gentle Friends:
 Peace to my Foes, if any such there be,
 And gracious Heav'n give Repose to me.
