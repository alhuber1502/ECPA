ode to ambition.

by the same.

over midnight glass, or by the fair
 in dalliance soft care;
 without a thought, without a care
 to discompose their rest,
 the mean herd exult pant to rove
 the flowery path of pleasure fairy grove:

while more determine bosom glow
 with high ambition fire;
 source of whatever be great below,
 the grave of mean desire:
 adieu for they the pleasure-winged hour,
 adieu the bed of ease, the paphian bower! 

though rough the path that lead to fame;
 their step no toil dismay;
 ambition aid the generous aim,
 and smooth the rugged way:
 with all its lustre bid bright virtue shine,
 and into action wake the big design. 

what break the aspire statesman rest? 
what give the muse to sing? 
ambition wake his anxious breast,
 and plume her tower wing:
 instruct the feeble monarch how to bear
 the crown, and all the thorn that fasten there. 

the general wakeful bosom fire,
 and guard the jealous camp;
 the scholar flatter hope inspire,
 and trim the midnight lamp;
 the pride of art from fair ambition spring,
 and bloom secure beneath her foster wing. 

oft, goddess, as thy genial ray
 pervade the feeling heart,
 love tremble quit his sensual sway,
 and drop his feeble dart:
 the flower, that in the paphian garden grow,
 fade in the wreath that round the hero brow. 

pleasure retreat with wanton smile,
 and strength-unnerving eye;
 hope in vain by parthian wile
 to conquer as she fly:
 sloth with reluctance quit her foul embrace,
 rough care and manly toil assume her place. 

virtue with firm quaternion band
 his eager step precede;
 a flambleau grasp in her hand,
 to light to glorious deed:
 the sister-train his toil with glory crown,
 and point the arduous path to fair renown. 

by these inspire young Scipio tread
 to fame the adventurous way;
 "by love, he cry, let paphos god
 the soft soul betray;
 a noble quarry lure the hero eye:"
 he speak, and bid the unconquered eagle fly. 

hence then, you slave, who ease delight,
 to yond lone cloister stray,
 where monkish apathy invite
 to dose tame life away:
 true worth, that spurn the hermit sluggard cell,
 in glory active court delight to dwell.
