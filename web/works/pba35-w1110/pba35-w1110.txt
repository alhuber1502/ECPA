To Sophronia. 

Sophronia, all the World agree,
 The Soul of Friendship dwells in Thee:
 Let Envy other Gifts dispute,
 Since here the Fury must be mute. 
Without one vain, one venal View,
 The Muse inscribes these Lines to you. 
Tho' I thy Favour shall not share,
 Thy Worth I'm destin'd to revere;
 And in Sophronia must commend
 The firm, disinterested Friend:
 To Virtue I this Homage pay,
 Rewarded, tho' you slight the Lay. 

Those who thy Favour once obtain,
 Need not sollicit thee again;
 Nor ever at Neglect repine:
 Their Wishes and their Cares are thine:
 Nor at the Grave thy Friendship ends;
 But to Posterity descends. 

Hail, sacred Friendship! seldom found,
 Tho' sought for all the World around:
 Say, Blessing of the peaceful Cell! 
How cam'st thou in a Court to dwell?
