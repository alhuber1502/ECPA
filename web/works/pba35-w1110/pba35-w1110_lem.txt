to Sophronia. 

Sophronia, all the world agree,
 the soul of friendship dwell in thou:
 let envy other gift dispute,
 since here the fury must be mute. 
without one vain, one venal view,
 the muse inscribe these line to you. 
though i thy favour shall not share,
 thy worth i be destine to revere;
 and in Sophronia must commend
 the firm, disinterest friend:
 to virtue i this homage pay,
 reward, though you slight the lay. 

those who thy favour once obtain,
 need not solicit thou again;
 nor ever at neglect repine:
 their wish and their care be thy:
 nor at the grave thy friendship end;
 but to posterity descend. 

hail, sacred friendship! seldom find,
 though seek for all the world around:
 say, bless of the peaceful cell! 
how come thou in a court to dwell?
