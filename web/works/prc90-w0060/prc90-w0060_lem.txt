a romantic scene

which happen in the year 1746. 

Phenes and hero far retire,
 without one wish to be admire,
 live in a lonely den;
 of equal birth in friendship bless,
 a mutual passion both confess,
 and shun the path of man. 

the charm of nature be their pride,
 the wind wood, the water side,
 the chief of their delight;
 how please, how fond will they stray,
 at early dawn, or beam day,
 or mark the solemn night. 

these lovely maid, with equal grace,
 do differ far in form and face,
 but both complete fair;
 and angel smile on Phenes' lip,
 her bloom do every rose eclipse,
 and yellow be her hair. 

but hero pale as winter snow,
 do each expressive feature show,
 that make fair Helen shine;
 her glossy hair, as black as jet,
 hang almost wave to her foot;
 she seem or be divine. 

it be on the soft morn in spring,
 when heart at ease elate sing,
 to hail the rise year,
 the dew drop hang from every flower,
 they rise and leave their little bower,
 and wander void of fear. 

at length they reach a lofty hill;
 they climb a rock â€” then both stand still
 to view the rise sun;
 not distant far they spy a swain;
 they feel a sort of please pain,
 but strive the path to shun. 

o! such a youth be seldom see,
 in belt plaid and vest of green,
 with look of manly pride;
 all gay in ancient grandeur dress,
 a brilliant star adorn his breast,
 a sword hang by his side,

they turn with modest look and shy;
 he stand, he gaze, he come not nigh;
 he hold his wound heart. 
nor do he know, nor can he tell
 which lovely maid do most excel,
 or who have shoot the dart. 

fair Phenes' beauty he admire;
 her smile, her bloom, his bosom fire,
 her soft her easy air;
 but when he gaze on hero eye,
 he feel such strong emotion rise,
 it be too much to bear. 

now homeward as they bend their course,
 the first time ever they feel the force
 of love resistless power,
 they blush; they know not what to say;
 they walk in silence all the way,
 and slow reach their bower. 

unknown to every low disguise,
 they scarce can meet each other eye,
 so strange do they feel;
 o needless care, it be in vain! 
for love, of every other pain,
 no woman can conceal. 

their tender passion both confess;
 night draw apace, they fight for rest
 but sleep have fly away. 
his image be a wake dream;
 when Luna show her pallid beam
 they think it break of day. 

say hero, Phenes, will you go,
 to yonder lofty hill you know,
 and taste the morning breeze;
 again i think to tread the place
 where we behold that angel face,
 will give my bosom ease. 

o no! reply the other maid,
 for i i will seek the dark shade,
 nor trust the hill again
 it will but fill my heart with grief;
 can barren mountain give relief,
 when absent be the swain? 

while thus they argue, all around
 they hear soft music melt sound,
 send in a move strain:
 then hand in hand they walk along,
 to join its echo with a song,
 and wander over the plain. 

but ah! what pleasure and surprise,
 when lo! before their wish eye
 appear the handsome youth
 at once amaze they see the moon;
 it be as they have meet too soon,
 too late to hide the truth. 

his tremble lip forsake the flute;
 resolve no long to be mute,
 he thus address the fair:
 i fear, sweet maid, i have be too bold,
 but in cleanthus you behold
 the victim of despair. 

and o my grief of such a kind,
 i never must reveal my mind,
 but pine in endless woe. 
he say no more, but heave a sigh,
 one silent tear bedew his eye,
 he bow, and turn to go. 

forget all their female pride,
 for female weakness will not hide,
 they catch he in their arm:
 o do not, do not fly away! 
at least till noon with we you will stay;
 your voice, your music charm. 

our dwelling be but small and mean,
 a little hut on yonder green,
 we boast no princely hall. 
but there all nature strew her sweet,
 the tuneful choir in concert meet,
 and there the water fall. 

then welcome, stranger, free share
 our humble roof, our simple fare,
 we will try to soothe your woe. 
or if fatigue, you wish to rest,
 to ease the struggle of your breast,
 we will sing you to repose. 

beyond his utmost hope delight,
 by beauty self, by love invite,
 with they he free go;
 nor be they distant from the spot,
 where stand the sweet romantic cot,
 the mansion of content. 

all day the happy stranger stay;
 he talk, he sing, his flute he play,
 to charm each tender heart;
 but o! when Phoebus hide his head,
 the charm be break, the transport flee,
 alas! they be doom to part. 

farewell, he cry! i bid adieu
 to all i prize, in leave you
 i leave my soul behind! 
for never do i chance to meet
 with maid so lovely and so sweet,
 so kill, and so kind. 

on i do fate and fortune frown;
 though bear to reign, and wear a crown,
 alas i be doom to mourn:
 a exile from my native shore,
 i never will behold you more;
 i never can return! 

the blood forsake fair Phenes' cheek,
 she fob aloud, but can not speak,
 she fear to bid he stay:
 bright hero ruby lip turn pale,
 she find her vital spirit fail,
 she sink, and die away. 

i see, he say, i have be wrong;
 indeed, i fear, i have stay too long,
 and now i can go. 
why do i ever thy dwelling trace,
 for ever let i hide my face,
 the cause of so much woe. 

with hero every art they try,
 but death their utmost skill defy,
 her spotless soul have flee:
 distract for her loss, they rave;
 in Leder den they dig her grave,
 and lay she with the dead. 

cleanthus stay a day or two,
 till cruel foe his step pursue,
 then be he force to fly:
 now, Phenes, who can paint thy grief,
 without one hope to give relief,
 or check the burst sigh? 

her friend, her lover, ever lose,
 on sorrow ample ocean tost,
 her charm begin to fade;
 for twice twelve month do Phenes weep,
 till her fair eye be close in sleep,
 below the silent shade. 

it be only philomel can tell
 the time, the place where Phenes fall,
 and end all her care. 
two gentle spirit have be see,
 in fairy dress, of rural green,
 to walk and wander there.
