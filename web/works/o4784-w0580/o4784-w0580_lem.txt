to a friend, in praise of the invention of write letter.

bless be the man! his memory at least,
 who find the art, thus to unfold his breast;
 and teach succeed time a easy way
 their secret thought by letter to convey;
 to baffle absence, and secure delight,
 which, till that time, be limit to sight. 
the part farewell speak, the last adieu,
 the lessen distance past, then loss of view,
 the friend be go, which some kind moment give,
 and absence separate, like the grave. 
the wing of love be tender too, till then
 no quill, thence pull, be shape into a pen
 to send in paper-sheet, from town to town,
 word smootha they, and soft than he down
 over such he reign, who neighbourhood have join,
 and hope, from bough to bough, support by the wind. 
when for a wife the youthful patriarch send,
 the camel, jewel, and the steward go,
 a wealthy equipage, though grave and slow;
 but not a line, that may the lover show. 
the ring and bracelet woo her hand and arm;
 but have she know of melt word, the charm
 that under secret seal in ambush lie,
 to catch the soul, when draw into the eye,
 the fair assyrian have not take this guide,
 nor her soft heart in chain of pearl be tie. 

have these conveyance be then in date,
 Joseph have know his wretched father state,
 before a famine, which his life pursue,
 have send his other son, to tell the news. 

oh! may i live to see a art arise,
 as this to thought, indulgent to the eye;
 that the dark power of distance can subdue,
 and make i see, as well as talk to you;
 that tedious mile, nor tract of air may prove
 bar to my sight, and shadow to my love! 
yet be it grant, such unbounded thing
 be wander wish, bear on fancy wing,
 they will stretch themselves beyond this happy case,
 and ask a art, to help we to embrace.
