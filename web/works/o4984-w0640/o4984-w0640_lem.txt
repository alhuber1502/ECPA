prayer for indifference.

by mrs. Greville.

oft i have implore the god in vain,
 and pray till i have be weary:
 for once i will seek my wish to gain
 of Oberon the fairy. 

sweet airy be, wanton spright,
 who live in wood unseen;
 and oft by cynthia silver light
 trip gay over the green;

if ever thy pity heart be move
 as ancient story tell;
 and for the athenian maid who love,
 thou seek a wondrous spell,

o! deign once more to exert thy power! 
haply some herb or tree,
 sovereign as juice from western flower,
 conceal a balm for i. 

i ask no kind return in love,
 no tempt charm to please;
 far from the heart such gift remove,
 that sigh for peace and ease! 

nor ease, nor peace, that heart can know,
 that, like the needle true,
 turn at the touch of joy or woe;
 but, turn, tremble too. 

far as distress the soul can wound,
 it be pain in each degree:
 it be bliss but to a certain bound —
 beyond — be agony. 

then take this treacherous sense of i,
 which doom i still to smart;
 which pleasure can to pain refine;
 to pain new pang impart. 

o! haste to shed the sovereign balm,
 my shatter nerve new-string:
 and for my guest, serene calm,
 the nymph indifference bring! 

at her approach, see hope, see fear,
 see expectation fly! 
and disappointment in the rear,
 that blast the purpose joy. 

the tear, which pity teach to flow,
 my eye shall then disown;
 the heart, that throb at other woe,
 shall then scarce feel its own. 

the wound which now each moment bleed,
 each moment then shall close;
 and tranquil day shall still succeed
 to night of sweet repose. 

o fairy-elf! but grant i this,
 this one kind comfort send! 
and so may never-fading bliss
 thy flowery path attend! 

so may the glow-worm glimmer light,
 thy tiny footstep lead
 to some new region of delight,
 unknown to mortal tread! 

and by thy acorn goblet fill
 with heaven ambrosial dew,
 from sweet, fresh flower distil,
 that shed fresh sweet for you! 

and what of life remain for i,
 i will pass in sober ease;
 half-pleased, content will i be,
 content — but half to please.
