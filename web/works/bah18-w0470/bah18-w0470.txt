A MERMAID'S SONG.

NOW the dancing sunbeams play
 On the green and glassy sea;
 Come, and I will lead the way,
 Where the pearly treasures be. 
Come with me, and we will go
 Where the rocks of coral grow;
 Follow, follow, follow me. 

Come, behold what treasures lie
 Deep below the rolling waves,
 Riches hid from human eye
 Dimly shine in ocean's caves;
 Stormy winds are far away,
 Ebbing tides brook no delay;
 Follow, follow, follow me.
