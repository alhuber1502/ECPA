a mermaid song.

now the dance sunbeam play
 on the green and glassy sea;
 come, and i will lead the way,
 where the pearly treasure be. 
come with i, and we will go
 where the rock of coral grow;
 follow, follow, follow i. 

come, behold what treasure lie
 deep below the roll wave,
 riches hide from human eye
 dim shine in ocean cave;
 stormy wind be far away,
 ebb tide brook no delay;
 follow, follow, follow i.
