fable [28] xxviii.

the persian, the sun and the cloud.

be there a bard who genius fire,
 who every think the god inspire? 
when envy read the nervous line,
 she fret, she rail, she rave, she pine,
 her hiss snake with venom swell,
 she call her venal train from hell,
 the servile fiend her nod obey,
 and all curl author be in pay. 
fame call up calumny and spite. 
thus shadow owe its birth to light. 

as prostrate to the god of day
 with heart devout a persian lay;
 his invocation thus begin. 

parent of light, all-seeing sun,
 prolific beam, who ray dispense
 the various gift of providence,
 accept our praise, our daily prayer,
 smile on our field and bless the year. 

a cloud, who mock his grateful tongue,
 the day with sudden darkness hang,
 with pride and envy swell, aloud
 a voice thus thunder from the cloud. 

weak be this gawdy god of thy,
 who i at will forbid to shine;
 shall i nor vow, nor incense know? 
where praise be due the praise bestow. 

with fervent zeal the persian move
 thus the proud calumny reprove. 

it be that god, who claim my prayer,
 who give thou birth and raise thou there:
 when over his beam the veil be throw
 thy substance be but plain show. 
a pass gale, a puff of wind
 dispel thy thick troop combine. 

the gale arise; the vapor toss
 (the sport of wind) in air be lose;
 the glorious orb the day refine. 
thus envy break, thus merit shine.
