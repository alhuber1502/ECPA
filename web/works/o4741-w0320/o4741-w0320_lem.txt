the answer.

when i, in feeble verse, essay
 Nassau and anna praise,
 a lyric muse fly over my head,
 and drop a branch of bay:

i will have fix it on my brow;
 but Phoebus say, forbear;
 it be vanity to touch the bough,
 and sacrilege, to wear. 

give it the bard, who bold dare
 attempt the roman lyre;
 who wise check, but not impair
 the tower pindar fire. 

thus, sir, to you, in phoebus name,
 the laurel wreathe i send;
 and, since the god deny i fame,
 be glad it crown my friend.
