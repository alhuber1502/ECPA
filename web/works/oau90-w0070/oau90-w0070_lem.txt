to the right honourable the lady E. R.  upon she find a spider in her bed.

see what revenge great love do still prepare
to fright and punish the relentless fair;
into that bed, where by your cruel doom,
no passionate admirer ever may come;
where heaven on earth no eye but heaven see,
and cold virginity alone do freeze;
where beauty blossom, and in fold sweet,
a body white than the snowy sheet:
this black detest crawl thing be send
from angry Venus for your punishment;
this be, she cry, she that profane my rite,
laugh at my law, neglect my delight,
flush with a pride of virtue dare withstand
love fierce dart, and nature great command,
be now condemn by the avenge fate,
the a bedfellow, which above all she hate.
thus Andromeda flourish in her prime;
thus laugh at love, and thus still lose her time,
while bounteous pity her fair breast do warm,
the power above protect she from harm,
but when her rigour to contempt presume
her bloom beauty to a monster doom;
and though the cry of a afflict maid,
bring the renowned Perseus to her aid;
have not her will be tune to another strain
the warrior never have loose she from the chain,
love harmony in well tune heart appear
alike their hope, and still alike their fear.
no jar sound the consort can molest
the charm music fill each happy breast,
their will unite, and their charm soul agree.
like two soft flute, when sound in one key,
when honourable love with humble grace,
and merit plead to fill the happy space,
by your sweet side shall spider claim a place,
shall rival insect own a lovelike we,
and lie their sprawl filthy limb by you:
ah, madam, then must all mankind proclaim
it be punishment to you, to they a shame.
no more adorer then of hope bereave,
but to your bed some generous love receive,
marriage, like irish wood have such a charm,
no venom dare approach to do you harm:
if you will have no hate spider come
to bed, let love and honour fill the room.
