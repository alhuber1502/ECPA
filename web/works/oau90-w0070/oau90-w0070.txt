TO THE Right HONOURABLE THE LADY E. R. Vpon her finding a Spider in her BED.

SEE what Revenge great Love doth still prepare
To fright and punish the relentless Fair;
Into that Bed, where by your cruel doom,
No passionate Admirer e'er might come;
Where Heaven on Earth no Eye but Heaven sees,
And cold Virginity alone does freeze;
Where Beauty blossoms, and in folded sweets,
A Body whiter than the snowy Sheets:
This black detested crawling thing was sent
From angry Venus for your punishment;
This is, she cry'd, her that prophan'd my Rites,
Laugh'd at my Laws, neglected my Delights,
Flush'd with a Pride of Virtue durst withstand
Loves fiercest Darts, and Natures great Command,
Is now condemn'd by the avenging Fates,
T' a Bed-fellow, which above all she hates.
Thus Andromeda flourish'd in her Prime;
Thus laugh'd at Love, and thus still lost her time,
Whilst bounteous Pity her fair Breast did warm,
The Powers above protected her from harm,
But when her Rigour to contempt presum'd
Her blooming Beauties to a Monster doom'd;
And though the Cries of an afflicted Maid,
Brought the renown'd Perseus to her aid;
Had not her Will been tun'd t' another strain
The Warrior ne'r had loos'd her from the Chain,
Love's Harmony in well tun'd Hearts appears
Alike their hopes, and still alike their fears.
No jarring Sounds the Consort can molest
The charming Musick fills each happy Breast,
Their Wills unite, and their charm'd Souls agree.
Like two soft Flutes, when sounding in one key,
When honourable Love with humble Grace,
And Merit pleads to fill the happy space,
By your sweet side shall Spiders claim a place,
Shall Rival Insects own a Love-like ours,
And lay their sprawling filthy Limbs by yours:
Ah, Madam, then must all Mankind proclaim
'Tis punishment to you, to them a shame.
No more Adorers then of Hopes bereave,
But to your Bed some generous Love receive,
Marriage, like Irish Wood has such a Charm,
No Venom dares approach to do you harm:
If you would have no hated Spiders come
To Bed, let Love and Honor fill the Room.
