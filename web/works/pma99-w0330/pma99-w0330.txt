IN RETURN FOR THE PRESENT OF A PAIR OF BUCKLES.

The female heart by bribes is oft assail'd,
 Full oft by bribes the female heart is won,
 When tears, and sighs, and flatteries have fail'd,
 An ear-ring or a necklace might have done. 

Hence men their court by various presents make,
 A song, a fan, a top-knot, or a glove,
 The gift, still pleasing for the giver's sake,
 Is welcom'd as an emblem of his love. 

My gentle swain a happier art has found
 At once his passion and success to prove,
 Whilst by his magic gift my feet are bound,
 No power is left me to escape his love.
