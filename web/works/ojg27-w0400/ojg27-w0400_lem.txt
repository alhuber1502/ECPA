fable [39] xxxix.

the father and Jupiter.

the man to Jove his suit prefer;
 he beg a wife; his prayer be hear. 
Jove wonder at his bold address. 
for how precarious be the blessing! 

a wife he take. and now for heir
 again he worry heaven with prayer. 
Jove nod assent. two hopeful boy
 and a fine girl reward his joy. 

now more solicitous he grow,
 and set their future life in view;
 he see that all respect and duty
 be pay to wealth, to power, and beauty. 

once more, he cry, accept my prayer,
 make my love progeny thy care:
 let my first hope, my favourite boy,
 all fortune rich gift enjoy. 
my next with strong ambition fire,
 may favour teach he to aspire,
 until he the step of power ascend,
 and courtier to their idol bend. 
with every grace, with every charm
 my daughter perfect feature arm. 
if heaven approve, a father be bless. 
Jove smile, and grant his full request. 

the first, a miser at the heart,
 studious of every gripe art,
 heap hoard on hoard with anxious pain,
 and all his life devote to gain. 
he feel no joy, his care increase,
 he neither wake nor sleep in peace,
 in fancy want, (a wretch complete)
 he starve, and yet he dare not eat. 

the next to sudden honour grow,
 the thrive art of court he know;
 he reach the height of power and place,
 then fall, the victim of disgrace. 

beauty with early bloom supply
 his daughter cheek, and point her eye:
 the vain coquette each suit disdain,
 and glory in her lover pain. 
with age she fade, each lover fly,
 contemn, forlorn, she pine and die. 

when Jove the father grief survey,
 and hear he heaven and fate upbraid,
 thus speak the god. by outward show
 man judge of happiness and woe:
 shall ignorance of good and ill
 dare to direct the eternal will? 
seek virtue; and of that possess,
 to providence resign the rest.
