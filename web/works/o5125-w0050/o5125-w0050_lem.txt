the beauty of the spring.

hail happy shade, and hail thou cheerful plain,
 where peace and pleasure unmolested reign;
 where dewy bud their blush bosom show,
 and the cool river murmur as they flow:
 see yellow crowfoot deck the gaudy hill,
 while the faint primrose love the purling rill:
 sagacious bee their labour now renew,
 hum round the blossom, and extract their dew:
 in their new livery the green wood appear,
 and smile nature deck the infant year;
 see yond proud elm that shine in borrow charm,
 while the curl woodbine deck her age arm. 

when the streak east receive a light grey,
 and lark prepare to meet the early day;
 through the glad bower the shrill anthem run,
 while the groves glitter to the rise sun:
 then Phillis hasten to her darling cow,
 who shine tress wanton on her brow,
 while to her cheek enliven colour fly,
 and health and pleasure sparkle in her eye. 
unspoiled by riches, nor with knowledge vain,
 content Cymon whistle over the plain;
 his flock dismiss from their nightly fold,
 observe their health, and see their number tell. 
please with its be, see the nimble fawn
 sport in the grove, or wanton over the lawn,
 while the please courser frolick out the day,
 and the dull ox affect unwieldy play. 

then haste, my friend, to yonder sylvan bower,
 where peace and silence crown the blissful hour;
 in those still groves no martial clamour sound,
 no stream purple stain the guiltless ground;
 but fair scene our ravish eye employ,
 give a soft pleasure, and a quiet joy;
 grief fly from hence, and waste care subside,
 while winge with mirth the laugh minute glide. 
see, my fair friend, the paint shrub be gay,
 and round they head ambrosial odour play;
 at sight of thou the swell bud expand,
 and open rose seem to court thy hand;
 hark, the shrill linnet charm the distant plain,
 and philomel reply with soft strain;
 see those bright lily shine with milky hue,
 and those fair cowslip drop with balmy dew;
 to thou, my fair, the cheerful linnet sing,
 and Philomela warble over the spring;
 for thou those lily paint the fertile ground,
 and those fair cowslip be with nectar crown;
 here let we rest to shun the scorch ray,
 while curl zephyr in the branch play. 
in these calm shade no ghastly woe appear,
 no cry of wretch stun our fright ear;
 here no gloss hate, no saint wolf be see,
 nor busy face throng the peaceful green;
 but fear and sorrow leave the careful breast,
 and the glad soul sink happy to rest.
