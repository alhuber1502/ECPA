ANOTHER.

Addressed to a YOUNG LADY.

SWEET stream that winds through yonder glade,
 Apt emblem of a virtuous maid —
 Silent and chaste she steals along
 Far from the world's gay busy throng,
 With gentle yet prevailing force
 Intent upon her destin'd course,
 Graceful and useful all she does,
 Blessing and blest where're she goes,
 Pure — bosom'd as that wat'ry glass,
 And heav'n reflected in her face.
