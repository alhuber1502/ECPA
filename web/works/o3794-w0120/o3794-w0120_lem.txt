address to a young lady.

sweet stream that wind through yonder glade,
 apt emblem of a virtuous maid —
 silent and chaste she steal along
 far from the world gay busy throng,
 with gentle yet prevail force
 intent upon her destine course,
 graceful and useful all she do,
 bless and bless wherever she go,
 pure — bosom as that watery glass,
 and heaven reflect in her face.
