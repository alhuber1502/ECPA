inscription for a root-house.

fond man! retire to this still cell,
 and bid the busy world farewell;
 here seek the cherub happiness,
 who love the quiet lone recess,
 and shun the city noisy scene,
 for pleasure tranquil and serene. 

how solemn be the oak broad shade,
 the naked grove see through the glade,
 the rock that high project its steep,
 the distant prospect of the deep! 

fond man! here cheerful may thou spend
 thy swift-winged life, nor fear thy end;
 steal through life, as through the plain
 yond rill in murmur seek the main. 

here, when the saffron-vested dawn
 spread radiance over the dewy lawn,
 for hour exempt from woe and sin,
 thy ardent orison begin;
 here too at eve his praise display,
 who lead thou through the finish day.
