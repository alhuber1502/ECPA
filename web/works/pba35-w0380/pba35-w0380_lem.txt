write for my son, in a bible which be present to he.

welcome, thou sacred, solemn guest,
 who come to guide i to the bless. 
o fountain of eternal truth,
 thou gracious guardian of my youth! 
true wisdom to my soul dispense,
 that i may learn thy will from hence:
 still let i make thy word my rule,
 and still despise the scorn fool. 
inspire from thence, my verse shall soar,
 till time itself shall be no more. 

alas, my soul! and where be great,
 in glory of a mortal date? 
henceforth this vain ambition spare,
 and be eternity thy care.
