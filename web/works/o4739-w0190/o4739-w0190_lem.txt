ode

to ANNA Matilda.

o cease, Matilda! ceasethe strain,
 that woo indifference to thy arm;
 for what be all her boast charm? 
but only to be free from pain! 
and will thou then, her torpid ease,
 her listless apathy to know,
 renounce the magic power to please,
 and lose the luxury of woe? 
why do thy stream of sweet song,
 in many a wild maze wind along;
 foam on the mountain murmur side;
 or through the vocal covert glide;
 or among fairy meadow steal? —
 it be, because thy heart can feel! 
alas! if peace must be unknown,
 till every nerve be turn to stone,
 till not a tear-drop wet the eye;
 nor throb the breast for sorrow sigh,
 o may i never find relief,
 but perish, in the pang of grief! 

think not i reason thus, my fair! 
a stranger to corrod care! 
ah! if thou, seldom find repose,
 "i, rest not on a bed of rose." 
despair, cold serpent, love to twine
 about this helpless heart of i! 
yet, though neglect and forlorn,
 i scarce can check the smile of scorn,
 when those, the vulgar call the great,
 bend the important brow of state;
 and strive a consequence to find
 by seem more than humankind;
 well, let they strut their hour away,
 till grin death demand his prey! 
meanwhile, my ANNA! let we rove
 the scent vale, the bend grove,
 mix our hot tear with evening dew,
 and live for friendship and the Muse! 

yes, let we hasten hand in hand,
 where the blue billow lave the land,
 and as they quick recoil fly
 send on the surf a lengthen sigh,
 that strike the soul, with truth sublime,
 as it be the whisper tongue of time:
 for thus our short life ebb day
 murmur awhile, and hastes away! 
or let we seek the moulder wall,
 or some lone abbey gothic hall;
 recline upon the knee-worn stone,
 and catch the north wind be dismal moan,
 that amid his sorrow, seem to boast
 of many a gallant vessel lose! 
friend and lover sink in death —
 by the fury of his breath! 
what though at the imagine tale,
 thy alter cheek be sad pale;
 never can such sympathy annoy;
 for it be the price of dear joy! 

when far off the night storm fly,
 let we ponder on the sky! 
where million star be ever roll,
 which yet our weak eye dare behold;
 adore the self-existing cause
 that give to each its separate law;
 that, when the impetuous comet run
 athwart a wilderness of sun;
 tell it what mandate to obey,
 nor ever wander from its way;
 till back it hasten whence it be bring,
 beyond the boundary of thought! 
let not the studious seer reply,
 "attraction regulate the sky,
" and lend each orb the secret force,
 "that urge on, or check its course." 
or with his orrery expound
 creation vain fancy round. 
ah! quit thy toil, presumptuous sage! 
destroy thy calculate page;
 no more on second cause plod;
 it be not attraction, but it be god! 
and what the universe we call,
 be but a point, compare to all. 

such bliss the sensate bosom know,
 such bliss indifference never bestow;
 though small the circle we can trace,
 in the abyss of time and space;
 though learning have its limit get,
 the feeling of the soul have not. 
their vast excursion find no end:
 and rapture need not comprehend! 

it be true, we be ignorant how the earth
 wake the first principle of birth,
 with vegetative moisture feed
 to different purpose, different seed:
 give to the rose such balmy sweet,
 or fill the golden ear of wheat,
 paint the ripe peach with velvet bloom,
 or weave the thick wood mingle bloom; —
 yet, we can wander in the bower;
 can taste the fragrance of the flower;
 drink the rich fruit nectareous juice,
 and bend the harvest to our use. —

then give thy pure perception scope,
 and sooth thy heave heart with hope. 
hope shall instruct my sorrow friend;
 the soul fine fervour never can end;
 but when her limb by death be lay
 beneath some yew-tree hallow shade,
 then shall her soar spirit know
 the seraphim ecstatic glow. 
then shall the essential mind confess,
 that anguish have the power to bless,
 that feel be in bounty give,
 and own the sacred truth — in heaven.
