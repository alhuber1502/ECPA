FOR SUNDAY.

THIS is that day of sacred rest,
For holy meditation chose;
Then soar my thoughts among the blest,
And let my mortal cares repose.

The joys above are painted here,
By figures which the sense receives;
But how their glories shall appear,
We know no human heart conceives.

The sacred leisure of this day,
Let me improve for God and heaven;
To bliss that I secure my way,
To me on earth were Sabbaths given.

Now be my virtues all renew'd
And heavenly consolation speak;
Holy resolves be well pursued,
And guard the duties of the week.
