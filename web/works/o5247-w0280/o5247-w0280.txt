SONG.

IN Vain I strive to fly
 This Soul consuming Care,
 My Sorrows always nigh,
 And present every where. 

In vain I trace the Grove,
 There no Repose I find;
 What Place can banish Love
 From the subjected Mind. 

That pensive-falling Stream,
 Those Gales that whisper round,
 Increase the fatal Flame,
 And deeper fix the Wound. 

The silent Shades of night,
 Adds Horror to my Grief;
 The gay Return of Light
 To me brings no Relief.
