song.

in vain i strive to fly
 this soul consume care,
 my sorrow always nigh,
 and present every where. 

in vain i trace the grove,
 there no repose i find;
 what place can banish love
 from the subject mind. 

that pensive-falling stream,
 those gale that whisper round,
 increase the fatal flame,
 and deep fix the wound. 

the silent shade of night,
 add horror to my grief;
 the gay return of light
 to i bring no relief.
