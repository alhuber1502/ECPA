to John Hartopp ESQ

youth and pleasure tarry not.

i 

live, my dear Hartopp, live to day,
 nor let the sun look down and say,
 "inglorious here he lie. 
shake off your ease, and send your name
 to immortality and fame
 by every hour that fly. 

ii.

youth a soft scene, but trust she not,
 her airy minute swift as thought
 slide off the slippery sphere;
 moon with their month make hasty round,
 the sun have pass his vernal bound
 and whirl about the year. 

iii.

let folly dress in green and red,
 and Gird her waste with flow gold,
 knit blush rose round her head,
 alas! the gaudy colour fade,
 the garment wax old. 
Hartopp, mark the wither rose,
 and the pale gold how dim it show! 

iv.

bright and last bliss below
 be all romance and dream,
 only the joy celestial flow
 in a eternal stream. 
the pleasure that the smile day
 with large right hand bestow,
 false she leave convey away
 and shuffle in our woe. 
so have i see a mother play
 and cheat her silly child,
 she give and take a toy away,
 the infant cry, and smile. 

v. 

airy chance and iron fate
 hurry and vex our mortal state,
 and all the race of ill create;
 now fiery joy, now sullen grief
 command the reins of human life,
 the wheel impetuous roll;
 the harness hour and minute strive,
 and day with stretch pinion drive
 down fierce on the goal. 

vi.

not half so fast the Gally fly
 over the venetian sea,
 when sail and oar and labour sky
 contend to make her way. 
swift wing for all the fly hour
 the god of time prepare,
 the rest lie still yet in their nest
 and grow for future year.
