Wishing him ever with me.

I.

NOW be that smiling Moment blest
 When First I saw my Love,
 Jesus, the Fairest and the Best
 Of all the Forms above. 
A thousand Graces ever rise
 And bloom upon his Face,
 A thousand Arrows from his Eyes
 Shoot thro' my Heart with sweet Surprize,
 And stand to guard the Place. 

II.

All Natures Art shall never cure
 The Heavenly Pains I found,
 And 'tis beyond all Beauties Power
 To make another Wound:
 Earthly Beauties grow and fade,
 Nature may heal the Wounds She made,
 But Charms so much Divine
 Hold a long Empire of the Heart,
 What Heaven has joyn'd shall never part,
 And Jesus must be mine. 

III.

In vain the envious Shades of Night,
 Or Flatteries of the Day
 Would vail his Image from my Sight,
 Or tempt my Soul away;
 Jesus is all my Waking Theme,
 His Lovely Form meets every Dream,
 And knows not to depart:
 The Passion reigns
 Thro' all my Veins,
 And floating round the Crimson Stream
 Still finds him at my Heart. 

IV.

Dwell there, for ever dwell, my Love;
 Here I confine my Sence,
 Nor dare my Wildest Wishes rove,
 Nor stir a Thought from thence. 
Let me be lost in thine Embrace
 As Rivers in the Sea;
 Or live Eternity of Days
 To spend them all with thee. 
Still I would lie in those dear Arms
 Dissolving still among thy Charms,
 And as the Moments fly,
 I'de Breathe away successive Souls,
 So Billow after Billow rolls
 To kiss the Shoar, and Dye.
