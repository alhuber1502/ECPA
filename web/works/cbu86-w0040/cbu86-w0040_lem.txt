the holy fair.

i 

upon a simmer Sunday morn,
 when nature face be fair,
 i walk forth to view the corn,
 and snuff the callor air. 
the rise sun, our Galston muir,
 with glorious light be glintan;
 the hare be hirplan down the fur,
 the lav'rock they be chantan
 full sweet that day. 

ii.

as lightsome i glower abroad,
 to see a scene so gay,
 three hizzy, early at the road,
 cam skelpan up the way. 
two have manteele of doleful black,
 but one with lyart line;
 the third, that go a wee aback,
 be in the fashion shine
 full gay that day. 

iii.

the two appear like sister twin,
 in feature, form a clae;
 their visage wither, long and thin,
 and sour as any slae:
 the third cam up, hap-step-an'-loup,
 as light as any lambie,
 and with a curchie low do stoop,
 as soon as ever she see i,
 full kind that day. 

iv.

with bonnet off, quoth i, "sweet lass,
" i think you seem to ken i;
 "I be sure i have see that bony face,
" but yet i can name you. " 
quo' she, and laughan as she speak,
 and take i by the han,
" you, for my sake, have gien the feck
 "of all the ten comman
 a screed some day." 

v. 

 "my name be fun — your crony dear,
" the near friend you have;
 "and this be superstition here,
" and that be hypocrisy. 
 "I be go to ********* holy fair,
" to spend a hour in daffin:
 "gin you will go there, yond runkle pair,
" we will get famous laughin
 at they this day. " 

vi.

quoth i, "with all my heart, i will do it;
" i will get my sunday sark on,
 "and meet you on the holy spot;
" faith, we'se have fine remarkin! " 
then i go home at crowdie-time,
 and soon i make i ready;
 for road be clad, from side to side,
 with money a weary body,
 in drove that day. 

vii.

here, farmer gash, in ridin graith,
 go hoddan by their cotter;
 there, swanky young, in braw braid-claith,
 be springan our the gutter. 
the lass, skelpan barefit, throng,
 in silk and scarlet glitter;
 with sweet-milk-cheese, in money a whang,
 a farl, bake with butter,
 full crump that day. 

viii.

when by the plate we set our note,
 well heap up with halfpence,
 a greedy glowr black-bonnet throw,
 and we must draw our tippence. 
then in we go to see the show,
 on every side they be gath'ran;
 some carryan dail, some chair and stool,
 and some be busy bleth'ran
 right loud that day,

ix.

here stand a shed to fend the shower,
 and screen our countra gentry;
 there, racer jess, and twathree wh — res,
 be blinkan at the entry. 
here sit a raw of tittlan jad,
 with heave breast and bare neck;
 and there, a batch of Wabster lad,
 blackguard from k*******ck
 for fun this day. 

x. 

here, some be thinkan on their sin,
 and some upon their clae;
 one curse foot that file his shin,
 anoth sigh and pray:
 on this hand sit a elect swatch,
 with screwed-up, grace-proud face;
 on that, a set of chap, at watch,
 throng winkan on the lass
 to chair that day. 

xi.

o happy be that man, and bless! 
no wonder that it pride he! 
who own dear lass, that he like best,
 come clinkan down beside he! 
with arm repose on the chair-back,
 he sweet do compose he;
 which, by degree, slip round her neck,
 and have loof upon her bosom
 unkenned that day,

xii.

now all the congregation over
 be silent expectation;
 for ****** speel the holy door,
 with tiding of s—lv—t—n. 
shall horny, as in ancient day,
 among son of G— present he,
 the vera fight of ******'s face,
 to his own het home have send he
 with fright that day. 

xiii.

hear how he clear the point of faith
 with rattlin and thumpin! 
now meek calm, now wild in wrath,
 he be stampan, and he be jumpan! 
his lengthen chin, his turn up snout,
 his eldritch squeel and gesture,
 o how they fire the heart devout,
 like cantharidian plaster
 on such a day! 

xiv.

but hark! the tent have change it be voice;
 there be peace and rest no long;
 for all the real judge rise,
 they can sit for anger. 
***** open out his cauld harangue,
 on practice and on moral;
 and off the godly pour in thrang,
 to give the jar and barrel
 a lift that day. 

XV. 

what signify his barren shine,
 of moral power and reason? 
his english style, and gesture fine,
 be all clean out of season. 
like Socrates or antonine,
 or some old pagan heathen,
 the moral man he do define,
 but never a word of faith in
 that be right that day. 

xvi.

in guide time come a antidote
 against such poosioned nostrum;
 for *******, from the water-fit,
 ascend the holy rostrum:
 see, up he be get the word of g —,
 and meek and mim have view it,
 while common-sense have take the road,
 and off, and up the cowgate
 fast, fast that day. 

xvii.

we ******, ny, the guard relieve
 and orthodoxy raible,
 though in his heart he well believe,
 and think it old wife fable:
 but faith! the birkie want a Manse,
 so, canny he hum they;
 although his carnal wit and sense
 like hafflins-wife overcome he
 at time that day. 

xviii.

now, butt and ben, the change-house fill,
 with yill-caup commentator:
 here be cry out for bake and gills,
 and there the pint-stowp clatter;
 while thick and throng, and loud and long,
 with logic, and with scripture,
 they raise a din, that, in the end,
 be like to breed a rupture
 of wrath that day. 

xix.

leeze i on drink! it give we more
 than either school or college:
 it kindle wit, it wauken Lear,
 it pang we fou of knowledge. 
be it whisky-gill or penny-wheep,
 or only strong potion,
 it never fail, on drink deep,
 to kittle up our notion,
 by night or day. 

xx.

the lad and lass, blythe bend
 to mind both saul and body,
 sit round the table, well content,
 and steer about the toddy. 
on this ane's dress, and that ane's leuk,
 they be makin observation;
 while some be cosy in the neuk,
 and form assignation
 to meet some day. 

xxi.

but now the l — be own trumpet tout,
 till all the hill be rairan,
 and echos back return the shout;
 black ****** be not spairan:
 he piercin word, like Highlan sword,
 divide the joint and marrow;
 his talk of h — ll, whare devil dwell,
 our vera "Sauls do harrow" 
with fright that day! 

xxii.

a vast, unbottomed, boundless pit,
 fill fou of lowan brunstane,
 who rage flame, and scorch heat,
 will have melt the hard whunstane! 
the half asleep start up with fear,
 and think they hear it roaran,
 when present it do appear,
 it be but some neebour snoran
 asleep that day. 

xxiii.

 'twad be our long a tale to tell,
 how money story past,
 and how they crowd to the yill,
 when they be all dismiss:
 how drink go round, in cog and caup
 among the furm and bench;
 and cheese and bread, from woman lap,
 be deal about in lunch,
 and dawd that day. 

xxiv.

in come a gawsie, gash Guidwife,
 and sit down by the fire,
 sin draw her kebbuck and her knife;
 the lass they be shy. 
the old guidman, about the grace,
 from side to side they bother,
 till some one by his bonnet lay,
 and give they, like a tether,
 full long that day. 

xxv.

Waesucks! for he that get no lass,
 or lass that have nothing! 
small need have he to say a grace,
 or melvie his braw clathe! 
o wife be mindful, once yourself,
 how bony lad you want,
 and do, for a kebbuck-heel,
 let lass be affront
 on such a day! 

xxvi.

now Clinkumbell, with rattlan tow,
 begin to jow and croon;
 some swagger home, the best they dow,
 some wait the afternoon. 
at slap the billy halt a blink,
 till lass strip their shoe:
 with faith and hope, and love and drink,
 they be all in famous tune
 for crack that day. 

xxvii.

how money heart this day convert,
 of sinner and of lass! 
their heart of stane, gin night be gane,
 as saft as any flesh be. 
there be some be fou of love divine;
 there be some be fou of brandy;
 and money job that day begin,
 may end in Houghmagandie
 some ither day.
