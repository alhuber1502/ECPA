a song.

by the same.

not the soft sigh of vernal gale,
 the fragrance of the flowery vale,
 the murmur of the crystal rill,
 the vocal grove, the verdant hill;
 not all their charm, though all unite,
 can touch my bosom with delight. 

not all the gem on india shore,
 not all peru unbounded store,
 not all the power, nor all the fame,
 that hero, king, or poet claim;
 nor knowledge which the learn approve,
 to form one wish my soul can move. 

yet nature charm allure my eye,
 and knowledge, wealth, and fame i prize:
 fame, wealth, and knowledge i obtain,
 nor seek i nature charm in vain;
 in lovely Stella all combine,
 and, lovely Stella! thou be i.
