on a lady sing.

how be i charm, when fair Harmonia sing! 
what heavenly sweetness dwell upon her tongue! 
what melt joy do she soft song impart! 
oh power of music, on a tender heart! 
while she repeat the lover ardent pain,
 my sympathise soul with she complain:
 soft flow the tear; the gentle sorrow rise,
 and my full bosom heave with strug'le sigh:
 but when a faithful, generous pair her theme;
 when in soft sound she sing their mutual flame,
 it be then i feel the lover soft excess;
 share in their joy, and triumph in their bliss;
 wish i may thus to tenderness be move,
 and love like they, like they to be belove:
 oh say, bright virgin, by what powerful art
 thy song give real rapture to the heart,
 and make the struggle soul alternate prove
 the joy of true, and pang of perjure love:
 a voice less fine than you the bard possess,
 who magic sweetness move tree confess. 
on mortal! thy superior skill be show,
 and heart subdue thy great power own.
