[Scarce a breeze on the lake, with four oars to our boat;]

SCarce a breeze on the lake, with four oars to our boat;
 The landscape! no pencil could paint. 
I thought of her fate, the midst of this scene,
 When a boar put us all in a fright. 
Confusion and terror, my heart beat my breast,
 Neither castle nor bower could I see;
 The beautiful! Queen who once made her escape,
 Was scarcely so frighted as me. 
The house — and the trees — the town and the spire;
 The hills — and the cottages round;
 The water — the wind — and the flight of the birds;
 Did only my senses confound. 
No thought was distinct — or but lost in myself;
 I pray'd — and our fate did deplore;
 When Serff that good saint — from his peaceful retreat,
 Came quickly, and brought us to shore.
