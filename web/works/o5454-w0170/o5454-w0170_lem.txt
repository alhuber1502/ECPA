song xvii.

love between brother and sister.

i 

whatever brawl disturb the street,
 there shall be peace at home;
 where sister dwell and brother meet,
 quarrel shall never come. 

ii.

bird in their little nest agree;
 and it be a shameful sight,
 when child of one family
 fall out, and chide and fight. 

iii.

hard name at first, and threaten word,
 that be but noisy breath,
 may grow to club and naked sword;
 to murder and to death. 

iv.

the devil tempt one mother son
 to rage against another,
 so wicked Cain be hurry on
 till he have kill his brother. 

v. 

the wife will make their anger cool,
 at least before it be night;
 but in the bosom of a fool
 it burn till morning-light. 

vi.

pardon, o lord, our childish rage,
 our little brawl remove;
 that as we grow to riper age,
 our heart may all be love.
