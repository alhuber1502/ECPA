IMITATION OF LINES

WRITTEN BY ROUCHER, BELOW HIS PICTURE, WHICH A FELLOW-PRISONER HAD DRAWN, AND WHICH HE SENT TO HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN THE DAY BEFORE HIS EXECUTION. â€” 1794.

Lov'd objects! cease to wonder when ye trace
 The melancholy air that clouds my face;
 Ah! while the Painter's skill this image drew,
 They rear'd the Scaffold, and I thought of you!
