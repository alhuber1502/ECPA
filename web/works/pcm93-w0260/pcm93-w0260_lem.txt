on the same.

little idol of my heart,
 thou to i can joy impart
 great than the glitter prize
 to ambition eager eye:
 great than the summer rise
 to the airy bee bestow:
 great than the youth despair
 to the haughty fair one ear;
 great than the fair one smile,
 skill her lover to beguile,
 to the enamour youth can give,
 shall she bid he love and live. 
soon the beauty shall decay,
 soon the rose shall fade away,
 soon the lover flame be over,
 power obtain soon charm no more:
 but nor time, nor Fortune change,
 can my love from thou estrange â€”
 that, on firm motive place,
 shall with my existence last.
