sonnet [32] xxxii. to melancholy. write on the bank of the arun, October, 1785. 

when late autumn spread her evening veil
 and the grey mist from these dim wave arise,
 i love to listen to the hollow sigh,
 through the half leafless wood that breathe the gale. 
for at such hour the shadowy phantom, pale,
 oft seem to fleet before the poet eye;
 strange sound be hear, and mournful melody,
 as of night wanderer, who their woe bewail! 
here, by his native stream, at such a hour,
 pity own Otway, i methinks can meet,
 and hear his deep sigh swell the sadden wind! 
oh melancholy! â€” such thy magic power,
 that to the soul these dream be often sweet,
 and soothe the pensive visionary mind!
