cen'lin, prince of Mercia. 

when Britain many chief obey,
 and seven saxon prince sway,
 the mercian monarch, fame afar,
 in peace respect, fear in war,
 favour by heaven above the rest,
 in his brave son be full bless;
 for none like cen'lin do arise,
 so virtuous, elegant, and wise. 

of partial mercian eye the joy,
 his parent idolise the boy;
 see with just pride each open grace,
 his charm of mind, of form, and face. 
and as he oft, with modest air,
 his thought and feeling do declare,
 his father will delight hear,
 will fond drop the grateful tear;
 and proud cast his eye around,
 but not a equal can be find. 
warm from each lip applause break,
 and every tongue his praise speak;
 the listen courtier spread his fame,
 and blessing follow cen'lin name. 

now twenty summer sun have fly,
 and mercia hope be full blow;
 when ah! conceal in coarse disguise,
 to selred court their darling fly. 
selred, his father scorn and hate,
 become the ruler of his fate. 
there flatter, love, the youth remain,
 till cenulph threat his heir regain. 

but ah! no more the son of mirth,
 his pensive eye now seek the earth;
 no more within the dance to move,
 or list to sage, do he love;
 but from surround friend will fly,
 to pour in solitude the sigh. 
and soon again the youth withdraw,
 again to th'eastern-saxons fly. 
his father hear, oppress with woe,
 his age heart forget to glow;
 he learn his foe a army lead,
 with youthful cen'lin at their head,
 he call his warrior forth to meet,
 and stretch the rebel at his foot:
 tear from his eye in anguish break,
 as thus the age monarch speak:

 "you mercian, let your banner fly! 
" the graceless youth this day shall die! 
 "for, since he dare a army bring
" against his father and his king,
 "though dear as life, i will not spare,
" nor listen to affection prayer! 
 "if all my people shall implore,
" i will pardon the rash boy no more! 
 "his harden heart, to duty blind,
" no tie of gratitude can bind;
 "this hoary head will else have rest,
" and pleasure warm this ache breast. 
 "ah, cruel youth! thy wrong i feel,
" more deep than wound of point steel. 
 "for, if forlorn the parent doom,
" who bear his offspring to the tomb,
 "some comfort still his breast may know,
" some soothe thought may calm his woe,
 "and when he give a loose to pain,
" he feel not that he mourn in vain,
 "but fancy still his darling nigh,
" and grateful for each burst sigh,
 "still bend over, with listen ear,
" each weep, fond complaint to hear,
 "the dear-loved phantom hover round,
" and pour a balm in every wound. 

 "how double poignant be my smart,
" bereave of my cen'lin heart! 
 "exile from that delude breast,
" where i have fond hope to rest,
 "with faith undoubting, sweet repose,
" till death shall bid my eye-lid close. 
 "and sometime yet will hope arise;
" till now he ever scorn disguise;
 "some curse fiend may taint his youth,
" and warp a temper form for truth. 
 "when late he humble kneel for grace,
" and clasp my knee in close embrace,
 "upon his lip a secret hang,
" but something seem to stay his tongue;
 "i press not, for my anger sleep,
" and fondness only see he weep;
 "ah! fatal haste! then have i know
" the serpent, i have save my son! 
 "yet sure pardon frank as i,
" a noble heart will more confine! 
 "when league with my bitter foe,
" to strike some grand, decisive blow;
 "perhaps to rob i of my throne,
" and make it, ere the time, his own;
 "or, shall wan guilt a danger dread,
" to humble this devote head,
 "each throb pang of conscience drown,
" and seize, with bloody hand, the crown. 
 "over this offence i cast a veil,
" and fond hush the whisper tale. 
 "ah fool! delude by the grace,
" of that fine form, and perfect face;
 "i think his bosom free from sin,
" nor dream a demon lurk within. 
 "his voice, which ever can control,
" each passionate of the hearer soul,
 "with ease my partial heart beguile,
" who know no sorrow when he smile. 
 "and ah! my friend, your downcast eye,
" your pensive air, and smother sigh,
 "all tell i you lament the fate,
" of he, who yet you can hate. 
 "and shall i bear then to behold,
" that form inanimate and cold,
 "he smile lip deprive of breath,
" his eye for ever close in death! 
 "ah no! my heart with anguish swell,
" and every throb vein rebel. 
 "let sorrow weep, or anger thrill,
" yet all the parent triumph still. 

 "oh father! who in mercy reign,
" if thy all-rule will ordain,
 "that my unhappy cen'lin die,
" remove the picture from my eye! 
 "at the same moment set we free,
" both rebel son, my god, to thou! " 

thus do the king pour forth his prayer,
 with all the wildness of despair;
 then, still every rise sigh,
 he calm the anguish of his eye,
 and though within the burden lie,
 he wipe the fall tear away. 

when lo! there come a youthful train,
 descend swift to the plain,
 dress like the fair son of day,
 in float robe and colour gay;
 no crest helmet there appear,
 no glitter shield or point spear,
 but youth with honeysuckle crown,
 or their fair lock with fillet bound,
 who circle rank and vary dye,
 show like the bow that gild the sky. 
while in the van a pair be see,
 of peerless charm and graceful mien;
 one lovely form the mercian know,
 and gladden at the please view,
 who, with the glow of youthful prime,
 have all the majesty of time. 
and beauteous be the fair he lead,
 as any fable grecian maid;
 the nymph who tend aurora car,
 and usher in the morning star,
 though make inhabitant of air,
 be not more elegant and fair;
 nor dian ever-healthful train,
 when skim over the spacious plain,
 have not more pure, more lively dye,
 or bright lustre in their eye. 

the king, so late by woe depress,
 feel hope reanimate his breast,
 and as his cen'lin near draw,
 his wake hope more vivid grow. 
 "my friend," he cry, "will you believe,
" that open mien can ever deceive? 
 "that bloom form can ever unfold,
" a heart ungenerous and cold,
 "that melt softness of the eye,
" can harbour dire cruelty? 
 "ah no! a poison baleful power,
" lurk not beneath so fair a flower. 
 "nor be those youth with amber hair,
" such as fall treason will prepare,
 "a aged monarch to dethrone,
" and hear, unmoved, a father groan. 
 "gay be their look, no dark disguise,
" dim the mild radiance of their eye;
 "no murderous thought their soul employ,
" but, herald of transport joy,
 "they come to bid suspicion cease,
" and sooth my sorrow into peace. " 
caution can scarce awhile control
 the strong delight of cenulph soul;
 when cen'lin kneel, and by his side
 half-kneeling, bend his lovely bride. 
but, when he first essay to speak,
 a hasty blush pass over his cheek,
 he hang awhile his graceful head,
 till thus, with air confuse he say:
" i come, by love with honour crown,
 "yet sorrow cast a shade around,
" that when my consort here i bring,
 "the heiress of a potent king,
" the mercian, clad in armour, come,
 "to lead their princess to she home. 
" no joyful hail our nuptial greet,
 "no proof of love my Ela meet,
" but scarlet banner, wave high,
 "the bridal knot and wreath supply. 
" alas! i see mistrust have win
 "even cenulph fondness from his son;
" or can my ever-honoured sire,
 "a proof of cen'lin faith require? 
" can force so needful now appear,
 "to aid a power which i revere? 
" when eager beauty form to view,
 "i first to selred court withdraw,
" a single wish thy power maintain,
 "a single wish thy son regain. 
" i leave the maid who matchless charm,
 "each root prejudice disarm,
" who rule my heart with sovereign sway,
 "and teach a mercian to obey
" law that eastsaxons can impart,
 "when wit and beauty string the dart;
" leave she when hope my doubt beguile,
 "and on our love her father smile. 
" oft have i try to win thy ear,
 "the fond, romantic tale to hear,
" but when i find a lonely hour,
 "my coward soul have lose the power;
" as on my lip the accent hang,
 "thy hate to selred check my tongue. 
" yet flatter hope my passion feed,
 "and from thy court again i flee;
" i think when you my fair behold,
 "and know how great she excel,
" in every charm, each art refine,
 "and virtue of the female mind,
" thy judgement will approve my choice,
 "and bless it with a cheerful voice. 
" and ah! though fortune do combine
 "with love, in make Ela mine,
" i can from a grief refrain,
 "remember that i give thou pain. 
" yet if thy cen'lin ever can please,
 "if ever my care can give thou ease,
" let mild affection now arise,
 "and beam forgiveness from thy eye! 
" no more thy son shall make thou know
 "a pain, or give thou cause of woe. 
" no flight the mercian have to fear,
 "for all i love be centre here." 
he speak, and over his father soul,
 a stream of heal comfort steal;
 he rise, with slow, majestic grace,
 tear of delight adorn his face,
 his pious heart with rapture glow,
 and joy a second youth bestow. 

 "to meet thou thus, my son," he cry,
 "this peerless maiden for your bride,
" bid each distress thought depart,
 "and joy again possess my heart. 
" fair princess, thy the happy fate,
 "to heal the wound of mutual hate;
" no long shall this bosom know,
 "a eastern-saxon as my foe;
" and she, who bid that passion rest,
 "doubt not, shall be supreme bless:
" the part be holy and benign,
 "befit such a form as thy. 
" this day, far dear than before,
 "kind heaven do twice my son restore,
" for by those speak look i see,
 "another value child in thou." 

as then he raise they to his breast,
 around the joyful mercian press,
 and make their shout of triumph rise,
 to the fair concave of the sky.
