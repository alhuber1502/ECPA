contentment.

while i beneath this silent shade,
 content sit and sing,
 i envy not the great their joy,
 that from their riches spring. 

let those who have in court be breed,
 there still in splendour shine;
 their lot of bliss may not surpass,
 perhaps not equal mine,

while no unwelcome visitant,
 my solitude invade;
 the monarch be not more secure,
 than i beneath this shade. 

these friendly tree on either side,
 from heat a shelter stand;
 the white rose on the brier hang,
 and seem to invite my hand. 

ah! rose, no long to my eye
 thy powerful charm display,
 for i have a sweet flower than you,
 and one that look more gay.
