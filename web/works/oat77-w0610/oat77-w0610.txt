Of the Few Adherers to Virtue.

THat Virtue Points our Way to Happiness,
Ev'n the Profane in Cooler Moods Confess:
But 'Cause the Brave and generous are Few,
Thin Trains this Guid to Happiness pursue.
Who 'Vouch her Cause, must 'bett a Suffring side
Expos'd to all the Out-Rages of Pride.
She's Exil'd now, and 'tis not strange to see
Mean Souls desert afflicted Majestie:
But when just Heav'n (and sure that Time draws on)
Restores this Empress to her Starry Throne,
With Crowns She will enrich her Loyall Few. 
Whilst Shame and Vengeance Crush the Rebel Crew.
