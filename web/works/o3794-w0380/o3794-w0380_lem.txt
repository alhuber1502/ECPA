to the reverend mr. Newton. 

a invitation into the country.

1. 

the swallow in their torpid state,
 compose their useless wing,
 and bee in hive as idle wait
 the call of early spring. 

2. 

the keen frost that bind the stream,
 the wild wind that blow,
 be neither feel nor fear by they,
 secure of their repose. 

3. 

but man all feeling and awake
 the gloomy scene survey,
 with present ill his heart must ache,
 and pant for bright day. 

4. 

old winter halt over the mead,
 bid i and mary mourn,
 but lovely spring peep over his head,
 and whisper your return. 

5. 

then April with her sister may,
 shall chase he from the bower,
 and weave fresh garland every day,
 to crown the smile hour. 

6. 

and if a tear that speak regret
 of happy time appear,
 a glimpse of joy that we have meet
 shall shine, and dry the tear.
