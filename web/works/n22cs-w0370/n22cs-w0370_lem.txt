sonnet [37] xxxvii. send to the Hon. mrs. O'Niell, with paint flower. 

the poet fancy take from Flora realm
 her bud and leaf to dress fictitious power,
 with the green olive shade minerva helm,
 and give to beauty queen, the queen of flower. 
but what gay blossom of luxuriant spring,
 with rose, mimosa, amaranth entwine,
 shall fable sylph, and fairy people bring,
 as a just emblem of the lovely mind? 
in vain the mimic pencil try to blend
 the glow dye that dress the flowery race,
 scent and colour by a hand divine! 
ah! not less vain will the muse pretend
 on her weak lyre, to sing the native grace
 and native goodness of a soul like thy!
