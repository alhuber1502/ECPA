sonnet [on the death of mr. Richard west]

in vain to i the smile morning shine,
and redden Phoebus lift his golden fire:
the bird in vain their amorous descant join,
or cheerful field resume their green attire:
these ear, alas! for other note repine,
a different object do these eye require.
my lonely anguish melt no heart but i;
and in my breast the imperfect joy expire.
yet morning smile the busy race to cheer,
and new-born pleasure bring to happy man:
the field to all their wonted tribute bear;
to warm their little love the bird complain.
i fruitless mourn to he that can hear,
and weep the more because i weep in vain.
