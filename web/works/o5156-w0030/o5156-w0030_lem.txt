Nancy of the vale.

a ballad.

by the same.

the western sky be purple over
with every please ray:
and flock revive felt no more
the sultry heat of day:

when from a hazel artless bower
soft-warbled strephon tongue;
he bless the scene, he bless the hour,
while Nancy praise he sing.

"let fop with fickle falsehood range
the path of wanton love,
while weep maid lament their change,
and sadden every grove:

but endless blessing crown the day,
i see fair esham dale!
and every blessing find its way
to Nancy of the vale.

it be from avona bank the maid
diffuse her lovely beam;
and every shine glance display
the na√Ød of the stream.

soft as the wild-duck tender young,
that float on avon tide;
bright as the water-lily, spring,
and glitter near its side.

fresh as the border flower, her bloom:
her eye, all mild to view;
the little halcyon azure plume
be never half so blue.

her shape be like the reed so sleek,
so taper, strait, and fair;
her dimple smile, her blush cheek,
how charm sweet they be!

far in the wind vale retire,
this peerless bud i find;
and shadow rock, and wood conspire
to fence her beauty round.

that nature in so lone a dell
shall form a nymph so sweet!
or fortune to her secret cell
conduct my wander foot!

gay lordling seek she for their bride,
but she will never incline:
"prove to your equal true, she cry,
"as i will prove to i.

"it be Strephon, on the mountain brow,
"have win my right good will;
"to he i give my plight vow,
"with he i will climb the hill. "

strike with her charm and gentle truth,
i clasp the constant fair;
to her alone i give my youth,
and vow my future care.

and when this vow shall faithless prove,
or i those charm forgo;
the stream that see our tender love,
that stream shall cease to flow.
