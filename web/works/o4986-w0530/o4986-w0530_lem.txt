to florella, put on a flower hat,

by the same.

florella, veil those radiant eye,
 those lovely feature hide;
 for which a thousand nymph have wish,
 a thousand swain have sigh. 

then may each youth more safe view
 the gay, the bloom maid;
 while half those grace lie conceal
 beneath that flowery shade. 

thus when the bright, meridian sun
 his vivid warmth display,
 we thank the kind officious cloud
 that shade the dazzle ray.
