TO FLORELLA, PUTTING ON A FLOWERED HAT,

BY THE SAME.

FLORELLA, veil those radiant eyes,
 Those lovely seatures hide;
 For which a thousand nymphs have wish'd,
 A thousand swains have sigh'd. 

Then might each youth more sasely view
 The gay, the blooming maid;
 While half those graces lie conceal'd
 Beneath that flowery shade. 

Thus when the bright, meridian sun
 His vivid warmth displays,
 We thank the kind officious cloud
 That shades the dazzling rays.
