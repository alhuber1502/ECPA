[Tophet]

inscription on a portrait

such Tophet be; so look the grin fiend
who many a fright prelate call his friend;
i see they bow and, while they wish he dead,
with servile simper nod the mitred head.
our mother-church with half-averted sight
blush as she bless her grisly proselyte:
hosannah ring through hell tremendous border,
and Satan self have thought of take order.
