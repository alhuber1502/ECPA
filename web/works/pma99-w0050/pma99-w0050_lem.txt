on sensibility.

if ever to friendship call you lend a ear,
 or sympathyse drop the soothe tear,
 oh, sensibility, receive my prayer! 
attend, and pardon that i seek to know,
 if in a world so fraught with various woe,
 thy votary find thou most their friend or foe. 
thy joy and grief alike let i survey,
 then fair ask thou if thy joy repay
 those pang, which soon or late the heart will rend,
 where thou be nourish as the gentle friend,
 when rude misfortune, with resistless sway,
 tear from that heart what most it love away;
 while feel alive to every pain,
 through thou it taste each sorrow over again;
 thus, crush beneath affliction heavy blow,
 it bear a double weight of human woe:
 ah cruel, thus to steal into the heart,
 and cherish there to act a traitor part. 

come then, indifference, thou easy guest,
 assume the empire over my torture breast,
 and by thy trifle, please, giddy sway,
 chace every heart-corroding pang away;
 teach i another grief unmoved to hear,
 and guard my eye against the fall tear;
 drive recollection from her inmost seat,
 nor let my heart with agitation beat;
 be thou my champion through life vary round,
 and shield my bosom from the slight wound. 

yet pause awhile! and let i take a view,
 lest with the pain i lose life pleasure too. 
say, do not duty, love, and friendship give,
 the great pleasure we can here receive;
 and can a heart untouched by other woe,
 the joy of friendship, love, and duty know? 

if such the purchase to be free from pain,
 oh, sensibility, to thou again
 i turn â€” do thou my every thought control,
 it be thy to animate or soothe the soul;
 it be thy alone those feeling to bestow,
 from which the source of every good do flow;
 since these thy joy, thy grief i will patient bear,
 and humble take of each the allot share;
 to friendship shrine the ready tribute bring,
 and fly to sorrow on compassion wing,
 enjoy the good, against the worst provide,
 by take resignation for my guide,
 in her safe conduct patient submit
 to every pain, which providence think fit.
