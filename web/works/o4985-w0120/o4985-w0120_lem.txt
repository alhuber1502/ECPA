write on a paper, which contain a piece of bride cake: give to the author by a lady.

by the same.

you curious hand, that hide from vulgar eye,
 by search profane shall find this hallow cake,
 with virtue awe forbear the sacred prize,
 nor dare a theft for love and pity sake! 

this precious relic, form by magic power
 beneath the shepherd haunt pillow lay,
 be mean by love to charm the silent hour,
 the secret present of a matchless maid. 

the cyprian queen, at Hymen fond request,
 each nice ingredient choose with happy art;
 fear, sigh, and wish of the enamour breast,
 and pain that please be mix in every part. 

with rosy hand the spicy fruit she bring
 from paphian hill, and fair cythera isle;
 and tempere sweet with these the melt thought,
 the kiss ambrosial and the yield smile. 

ambiguous look, that scorn and yet relent,
 denial mild, and firm unaltered truth,
 reluctant pride, and amorous faint consent,
 and meet ardour, and exult youth. 

sleep, wayward god! have swear while these remain,
 with flatter dream to dry his nightly tear,
 and cheerful hope, so oft invoke in vain,
 with fairy song shall sooth his pensive ear. 

if bind by vow to friendship gentle side,
 and fond of soul, thou hope a equal grace,
 if youth or maid thy joy and grief divide,
 o much entreat, leave this fatal place. 

sweet peace, who long have shun my plaintive day,
 consent at length to bring i short delight,
 thy careless step may scare her dove away,
 and grief with raven note usurp the night.
