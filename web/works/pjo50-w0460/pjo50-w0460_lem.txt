epistle, from fern-hill. 

to the same. 

Charlot, who my controller be chief,
 and dear love a little mischief,
 whenever i talk of pack up,
 to all my measure put a stop:
 and though i plunge from bad to worse,
 grow dull than her own dull horse;
 yet out of complaisance exceed,
 or pure perverseness, call good-breeding,
 will never let i have my way
 in any thing i do, or say. 

at table, if i ask for veal,
 in complaisance, she give i quail. 
i like your beer; it be brisk, and fine —
 "o no; John, give miss — some wine." 
and though from two to four you stuff,
 she never think you be sick enough:
 in vain your hunger cure, and thirst;
 if you will oblige she, you must burst. 

whether in pity, or in ire,
 sometime i be seat next the fire;
 so very close, i pant for breath,
 in pure good-manner scorch to death. 
content i feel her kindness kill,
 i only beg to make my will;
 but still in all i do, or say,
 this nuisance breeding in the way;
 over which to step i be much to lazy,
 and too oblige to be easy. 

oft do i cry, i be almost undo
 to see our friend in brooke-street, London. 
as serious the nymph invite
 her slave to stay till moonshine night. 
lo! from her lip what language break! 
what sweet persuasion, when she speak! 
her word so soft! her sense so strong! 
i only wish — to slit her tongue. 

but this, you will say be to make a clutter,
 forsooth! about one bread and butter. 
why, be it so; yet i will aver,
 that i be as great a plague to she;
 for wellbred folk be never so civil,
 as when they wish you at the D—I. 
so, Charlot, for our mutual ease,
 let we even shake hand, and part in peace;
 to keep i here, be but to teaze you,
 to let i go, will be to ease you. 

as when (to speak in phrase more humble)
 the general guts begin to grumble,
 whatever the cause that inward stir,
 or pork, or pease, or wind, or worse;
 he wise think the more it be pen,
 the more it will struggle for a vent:
 so only beg you will hold your nose,
 and gentle lift up his clothes,
 away the imprison vapour fly,
 and mount a zephyr to the sky. 

so i (with reverence be it speak)
 of such a guest be no bad token;
 in charlot chamber ever rumble,
 her pamphlet, and her paper tumble,
 displace all the thing she place,
 and, as be usual in such case,
 make her cut most sad wry face. 
yet, spite of all this rebel rout,
 she be too well breed to let i out,
 for fear you squeamish nymph at court
 (virgin of not the best report)
 shall on the tale malicious dwell,
 when i you see, or of i tell. 

o Charlot! when alone we sit,
 laugh at all our own (no) wit,
 you wise with your cat at play,
 i read swift, and spill tea;
 how will it please my ravish ear,
 to hear you, from your easy chair,
 with look serene, and brow uncurled,
 cry out, a — for all the world! 
but you, a slave to too much breed,
 and i, a fool, with too much read,
 follow the hive, as bee their drone,
 without one purpose of our own:
 till tire with blunder and mistake,
 we die sad fool of other make. 
stand it record on yond post,
 that both be fool then, to our cost! 
the question only, which be most? 
i, that i never yet have show
 one steady purpose of my own;
 or you, with both your blue eye wake,
 run blunder on, by choice mistake? —
 alas! we both may sleep content,
 our error purge, our fault repent;
 can you, unmoved, a squeamish look meet,
 or i forget our friend in brooke-street.
