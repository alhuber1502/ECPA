write in autumn.

o autumn! how i love thy pensive air,
 thy yellow garb, thy visage sad and dun! 
when from the misty east the labour sun
 burst through thy fog, that gather round he, dare
 obscure his beam, which, though enfeeble, dart
 on the cold, dewy plain a lustre bright:
 but chief, the sound of thy rest wood delight;
 their deep, low murmur to my soul impart
 a solemn stillness, while they seem to speak
 of spring, of summer now for ever past,
 of drear, approach winter, and the blast
 which shall ere long their soothe quiet break:
 here, when for fade joy my heave breast
 throb with vain pang, here will i love to rest.
