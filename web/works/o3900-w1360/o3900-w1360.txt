GRACE after MEAT.

I.

BLEST be the GOD, whose tender Care
 Prevents his Children's Cry,
 Whose Pity providently near
 Doth all our Wants supply. 

II.

Blest be the GOD, whose Bounty's Store
 These chearing Gifts imparts;
 Who veils in Bread, the secret Power
 That feeds and glads our Hearts. 

III.

Fountain of Blessings, Source of Good,
 To Thee this Strength we owe,
 Thou art the Virtue of our Food,
 Life of our Life below. 

IV.

When shall our Souls regain the Skies? 
Thy Heav'nly Sweetness prove? 
Fulness of Joys shall there arise,
 And all our Food be Love.
