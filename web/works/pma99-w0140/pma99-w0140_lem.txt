Instructions, suppose to be write in Paris, for the mob in ENGLAND.

of liberty, reform, and right i sing,
 freedom i mean, without or church or king;
 freedom to seize and keep whatever i can,
 and bold claim my right â€” the right of man
 such be the bless liberty in vogue,
 the envy liberty to be a rogue;
 the right to pay no tax, tithe, or due;
 the liberty to do whatever i choose;
 the right to take by violence and strife
 my neighbour good, and, if i please, his life;
 the liberty to raise a mob or riot,
 for spoil and plunder never be get by quiet;
 the right to level and reform the great;
 the liberty to overturn the state;
 the right to break through all the nation law,
 and bold dare to take rebellion cause:
 let all be equal, every man my brother;
 why one have property, and not another? 
why suffer title to give awe and fear? 
there shall not long remain one british peer;
 nor shall the criminal appall stand
 before the mighty judge of the land;
 nor judge, nor jury shall there long be,
 nor any jail, but every prisoner free;
 all law abolish, and with sword in hand
 we will seize the property of all the land. 
then hail to liberty, reform, and riot! 
adieu contentment, safety, peace, and quiet!
