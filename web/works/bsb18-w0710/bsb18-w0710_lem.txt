o Jenny dear.

o Jenny dear, lie by your pride,
 or else i plain see
 your wrinkle you will be fain to hide,
 maybe at sixty-three. 
but, take my word, it be then over late
 to gain a wayward man;
 a maiden old her hook may bait,
 but catch we gin you can! 

a unco prize forsooth you be! 
for, when the bait be take,
 you fill our heart so full of care,
 we wish they we again. 
to witch our faith, you tell a tale
 of love that never will end;
 no hinny word with i prevail,
 for man will never mend. 

but, Jenny, look at aunty Kate,
 who be a maiden old,
 It be warrant she repent late
 when wooers' heart grow cauld. 
a ape to lead a silly thing
 when you step down below,
 or here to sit with chitter wing
 like birdy in the snow. 

that be better than to sit at home
 with saut tear in my thou;
 a ape i think be a harmless thing
 to such a thing as you. 
good man be change from wooer sore,
 and nothing do but slight;
 a wife become a drudge of care,
 and never in the right. 

there be bonny tibby of the glen,
 and Anny of the hill,
 their beauty craze both their man,
 and may delight they still;
 but now they watch their lordies frown,
 their saul they daurna own;
 it be tyranny that wedlock crown,
 and woman joy be fly.
