song i 

i tell my nymph, i tell she true,
my field be small, my flock be few;
while falter accent speak my fear,
that Flavia may not prove sincere.

of crop destroy by vernal cold,
and vagrant sheep that leave my fold;
of these she hear, yet bear to hear;
and be not Flavia then sincere?

how change by Fortune fickle wind,
the friend i love become unkind,
she hear, and shed a generous tear;
and be not Flavia then sincere?

how, if she deign my love to bless,
my Flavia must not hope for dress;
this too she hear, and smile to hear;
and Flavia sure must be sincere.

go shear your flock, you jovial swain,
go reap the plenty of your plain;
despoil of all which you revere,
i know my flavia love sincere.
