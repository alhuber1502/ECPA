by the same.

how sweet the calm of this sequester shore,
 where ebb water musical roll:
 and solitude and silent eve restore
 the philosophic temper of the soul. 

the sigh gale, who murmur lull to rest
 the busy tumult of decline day,
 to sympathetic quiet soothe the breast,
 and every wild emotion die away. 

farewell the object of diurnal care,
 your task be end with the set sun:
 let all be undisturbed vacation here,
 while over yond wave ascend the peaceful moon. 

what beauteous vision over the soften heart,
 in this still moment all their charm diffuse,
 Serener joy and bright hope impart,
 and cheer the soul with more than mortal view. 

here faithful memory waken all her power,
 she bid her fair ideal form ascend,
 and quick to every gladden thought restore
 the social virtue, and the absent friend. 

come *******, come, and with i share
 the sober pleasure of this solemn scene,
 while no rude tempest cloud the ruffle air,
 but all, like thou, be smile and serene. 

come, while the cool, the solitary hour
 each foolish care, and giddy wish controul,
 with all thy soft persuasion wonted power,
 beyond the star transport my listen soul. 

oft, when on earth detain by empty show,
 thy voice have teach the trifler how to rise;
 teach she to look with scorn on thing below,
 and seek her better portion in the sky. 

come: and the sacred eloquence repeat:
 the world shall vanish at its gentle sound,
 angelic form shall visit this retreat,
 and open heaven diffuse its glory round.
