ode.

on melancholy.

to a friend.

by the same.

i 

ah! cease this kind persuasive strain,
which, when it flow from friendship tongue,
however weak, however vain,
overpower beyond the siren song:
leave i, my friend, indulgent go,
and let i muse upon my woe.
why lure i from these pale retreat?
why rob i of these pensive sweet?
can music voice, can beauty eye,
can painting glow hand, supply
a charm so suit to my mind,
as blow this hollow gust of wind,
as drop this little weep rill
soft-tinkling down the moss-grown hill,
while through the west, where sink the crimson day,
meek twilight slow sail, and wave her banner grey?

ii.

say, from affliction various source
do none but turbid water flow?
and can fancy clear their course?
for fancy be the friend of woe.
say, amid that grove, in love-lorn state,
when yond poor ringdove mourn her mate,
be all, that meet the shepherd ear,
inspire by anguish, and despair?
ah no, fair fancy rule the song:
she swell her throat; she guide her tongue;
she bid the wave aspin-spray
quiver in cadence to she lie;
she bid the fringe osier bow,
and rustle round the lake below,
to suit the tenor of her gurgle sigh,
and sooth her throb breast with solemn sympathy.

iii.

to thou, who young and polish brow
the wrinkle hand of sorrow spare;
who cheek, bestrew with rose, know
no channel for the tide of tear;
to thou yond abbey dank, and lone,
where ivy chain each moulder stone
that nod over many a martyr tomb,
may cast a formidable gloom.
yet some there be, who, free from fear,
can wander through the cloister drear,
can rove each desolate isle,
though midnight thunder shake the pile;
and dauntless view, or seem to view,
(as faint flash the lightning blue)
thin shiver ghost from yawn charnel throng,
and glance with silent sweep the shaggy vault along.

iv.

but such terrific charm as these,
i ask not yet: my sober mind
the faint form of sadness please;
my sorrow be of soft kind.
through this still valley let i stray,
wrap in some strain of pensive grey:
who lofty genius bear along
the conscious dignity of song;
and, scorn from the sacred store
to waste a note on pride, or power,
rove, when the glimmer twilight gloom,
and warble amid the rustic tomb:
he too perchance (for well i know,
his heart will melt with friendly woe)
he too perchance, when these poor limb be lay,
will heave one tuneful sigh, and sooth my hover shade.
