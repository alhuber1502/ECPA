song.

while many a fond and bloom maid
 attempt thy heart to gain;
 and, by thy fatal smile betray,
 think not she strive in vain:

while in those eye of tender blue
 they answer passion see,
 and in thy sweet expression view
 the charm that conquer i: .... 

i still shall scorn their win art,
 and be, my Henry, bless,
 if thou will give that precious heart
 to she who love thou best.
