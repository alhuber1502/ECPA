A HYMN TO HARMONY, In HONOUR of St. CECILIA's Day. MDCCI.

I.

O Harmony, to thee we sing,
To thee the grateful Tribute bring
Of Sacred Verse, and sweet resounding Lays;
Thy Aid invoking while thy Pow'r we praise.
All Hail to thee
All-pow'rful Harmony! 
Wise Nature owns thy undisputed Sway,
Her wond'rous Works resigning to thy Care;
The Planetary Orbs thy Rule obey,
And tuneful roll, unerring in their way,
Thy Voice informing each melodious Sphere.

CHORUS.

All Hail to thee
All-pow'rful Harmony! 

II.

Thy Voice, O Harmony, with awful Sound
Could penetrate th' Abyss profound,
Explore the Realms of ancient Night,
And search the living Source of unborn Light.
Confusion heard thy Voice and fled,
And Chaos deeper plung'd his vanquish'd Head.
Then didst thou, Harmony, give birth
To this fair form of Heav'n and Earth;
Then all those Shining Worlds above
In Mystick Dance began to move
Around the radiant Sphere of Central Fire,
A never ceasing, never silent Choir.

CHORUS.

Confusion heard thy Voice and fled,
And Chaos deeper plung'd his vanquish'd Head.

III.

Thou only, Goddess, first could'st tell
The mighty Charms in Numbers found;
And didst to Heav'nly Minds reveal
The secret force of tuneful Sound.
When first Cyllenius form'd the Lyre,
Thou didst the God inspire;
When first the vocal Shell he strung,
To which the Muses sung:
Then first the Muses sung; melodious Strains Apollo plaid,
And Musick first begun by thy auspicious Aid.
Hark, hark, again Urania sings!
Again Apollo strikes the trembling Strings!
And see, the list'ning Deities around
Attend insatiate, and devour the Sound.

CHORUS.

Hark, hark, again Urania sings!
Again Apollo strikes the trembling Strings!
And see, the list'ning Deities around
Attend insatiate, and devour the Sound.

IV.

Descend Urania, Heav'nly Fair,
To the relief of this afflicted World repair;
See how with various Woes opprest,
The wretched Race of Men is worn;
Consum'd with cares, with doubts distrest
Or by conflicting Passions torn.
Reason in vain employs her Aid,
The furious Will on Fancy waits;
While Reason still by Hopes or Fears betray'd,
Too late advances or too soon retreats.
Musick alone with suddain Charms can bind
The wand'ring Sense, and calm the troubled Mind.

CHORUS.

Musick alone with suddain Charms can bind
The wand'ring Sense, and calm the troubled Mind.

V.

Begin the pow'rful Song, yee Sacred Nine,
Your Instruments and Voices join;
Harmony, Peace, and sweet Desire
In ev'ry Breast inspire.
Revive the melancholy drooping Heart,
And soft Repose to restless Thoughts impart.
Appease the wrathful Mind,
To dire Revenge and Death inclin'd:
With balmy Sounds his boiling Blood asswage,
And melt to mild Remorse his burning Rage.
'Tis done; and now tumultuous Passions cease;
And all is husht, and all is Peace.
The weary World with welcome Ease is blest,
By Musick lull'd to pleasing Rest.

CHORUS.

'Tis done; and now tumultuous Passions cease;
And all is husht, and all is Peace.
The weary World with welcome Ease is blest,
By Musick lull'd to pleasing Rest.

VI.

Ah, sweet Repose, too soon expiring!
Ah, foolish Man, new Toils requiring!
Curs'd Ambition, Strife pursuing,
Wakes the World to War and Ruin.
See, see, the Battle is prepar'd!
Behold the Hero comes!
Loud Trumpets with shrill Fifes are heard,
And hoarse resounding Drums.
War, with discordant Notes and jarring Noise,
The Harmony of Peace destroys.

CHORUS.

War, with discordant Notes and jarring Noise,
The Harmony of Peace destroys.

VII.

See the forsaken fair, with streaming Eyes
Her parting Lover mourn;
She weeps, she sighs, despairs and dies,
And watchful wastes the lonely livelong Nights,
Bewailing past Delights
That may no more, no never more return.
O sooth her Cares
With softest, sweetest Airs,
'Till Victory and Peace restore
Her faithful Lover to her tender Breast,
Within her folding Arms to rest,
Thence never to be parted more,
No never to be parted more.

CHORUS.

Let Victory and Peace restore
Her faithful Lover to her tender Breast,
Within her folding Arms to rest,
Thence never to be parted more,
No never to be parted more.

VIII.

Enough, Urania, heav'nly fair,
Now to thy Native Skies repair,
And rule again the Starry Sphere;
Cecilia comes, with holy Rapture fill'd,
To ease the World of Care.
Cecilia, more than all the Muses skill'd!
Phoebus himself to her must yield,
And at her Feet lay down
His Golden Harp and Lawrel Crown;
The soft enervate Lyre is drown'd
In the deep Organ's more majestick Sound.
In peals the swelling Notes ascend the Skies;
Perpetual Breath the swelling Notes supplies,
And lasting as her Name,
Who form'd the tuneful Frame,
Th' immortal Musick never dies.

Grand CHORUS.
