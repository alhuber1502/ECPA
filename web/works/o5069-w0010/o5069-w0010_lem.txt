a hymn to harmony, in honour of saint cecilia day. mdcci.

i 

o harmony, to thou we sing,
to thou the grateful tribute bring
of sacred verse, and sweet resound lay;
thy aid invoke while thy power we praise.
all hail to thou
all-powerful harmony! 
wise nature own thy undisputed sway,
her wondrous work resign to thy care;
the planetary orb thy rule obey,
and tuneful roll, unerring in their way,
thy voice inform each melodious sphere.

chorus.

all hail to thou
all-powerful harmony! 

ii.

thy voice, o harmony, with awful sound
can penetrate the abyss profound,
explore the realm of ancient night,
and search the live source of unborn light.
confusion hear thy voice and flee,
and chaos deep plunge his vanquish head.
then do thou, harmony, give birth
to this fair form of heaven and earth;
then all those shine world above
in mystic dance begin to move
around the radiant sphere of central fire,
a never cease, never silent choir.

chorus.

confusion hear thy voice and flee,
and chaos deep plunge his vanquish head.

iii.

thou only, goddess, first can tell
the mighty charm in number find;
and do to heavenly mind reveal
the secret force of tuneful sound.
when first Cyllenius form the lyre,
thou do the god inspire;
when first the vocal shell he string,
to which the muse sing:
then first the muse sing; melodious strain Apollo play,
and music first begin by thy auspicious aid.
hark, hark, again Urania sing!
again Apollo strike the tremble string!
and see, the listen deity around
attend insatiate, and devour the sound.

chorus.

hark, hark, again Urania sing!
again Apollo strike the tremble string!
and see, the listen deity around
attend insatiate, and devour the sound.

iv.

descend Urania, heavenly fair,
to the relief of this afflict world repair;
see how with various woe oppress,
the wretched race of man be wear;
consume with care, with doubt distress
or by conflict passion tear.
reason in vain employ her aid,
the furious will on fancy wait;
while reason still by hope or fear betray,
too late advance or too soon retreat.
music alone with sudden charm can bind
the wander sense, and calm the trouble mind.

chorus.

music alone with sudden charm can bind
the wander sense, and calm the trouble mind.

v. 

begin the powerful song, you sacred nine,
your instrument and voice join;
harmony, peace, and sweet desire
in every breast inspire.
revive the melancholy droop heart,
and soft repose to restless thought impart.
appease the wrathful mind,
to dire revenge and death incline:
with balmy sound his boil blood assuage,
and melt to mild remorse his burn rage.
it be do; and now tumultuous passion cease;
and all be hush, and all be peace.
the weary world with welcome ease be bless,
by music lull to please rest.

chorus.

it be do; and now tumultuous passion cease;
and all be hush, and all be peace.
the weary world with welcome ease be bless,
by music lull to please rest.

vi.

ah, sweet repose, too soon expire!
ah, foolish man, new toil require!
curse ambition, strife pursue,
wake the world to war and ruin.
see, see, the battle be prepare!
behold the hero come!
loud trumpet with shrill fife be hear,
and hoarse resound drum.
war, with discordant note and jar noise,
the harmony of peace destroy.

chorus.

war, with discordant note and jar noise,
the harmony of peace destroy.

vii.

see the forsake fair, with stream eye
her part lover mourn;
she weep, she sigh, despair and die,
and watchful waste the lonely livelong night,
bewail past delight
that may no more, no never more return.
o sooth her care
with soft, sweet air,
until victory and peace restore
her faithful lover to her tender breast,
within her fold arm to rest,
thence never to be part more,
no never to be part more.

chorus.

let victory and peace restore
her faithful lover to her tender breast,
within her fold arm to rest,
thence never to be part more,
no never to be part more.

viii.

enough, Urania, heavenly fair,
now to thy native sky repair,
and rule again the starry sphere;
Cecilia come, with holy rapture fill,
to ease the world of care.
Cecilia, more than all the muse skill!
Phoebus himself to she must yield,
and at her foot lie down
his golden harp and laurel crown;
the soft enervate lyre be drown
in the deep organ more majestic sound.
in peal the swell note ascend the sky;
perpetual breath the swell note supply,
and last as her name,
who form the tuneful frame,
the immortal music never die.

grand chorus.
