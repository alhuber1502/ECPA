sonnet

to mrs. Bates.

o thou, who melody the heart obey,
 thou, who can all its subject passion move,
 who note to heaven the listen soul can raise,
 can thrill with pity, or can melt with love! 
happy! who nature lend this native charm,
 angelic tone, that shed, with magic power,
 a sweet pleasure over the social hour:
 the breast to softness soothe, to virtue warm;
 but yet more happy, that thy life as clear
 from discord as thy perfect cadence flow;
 that, tune to sympathy, thy faithful tear
 in mild accordance fall for other woe;
 that all the tender, pure affection bind,
 in chain of harmony, thy will mind!
