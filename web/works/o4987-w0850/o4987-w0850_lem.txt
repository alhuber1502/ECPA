verse on the expect arrival of queen Charlotte, in a epistle to a friend, 1761. 

by —.

yes — every hopeful son of rhyme
 will sure seize this happy time,
 vault upon pegasus back,
 now grow a academic hack,
 and sing the beauty of a queen,
 (who, by the by, he have not see)
 will swear her eye be black as jet,
 her tooth in pearl as coral set,
 will tell we that the rose have lend
 her cheek its bloom, her lip its scent,
 that philomel break off her song,
 and listen to her sweet tongue;
 that Venus and the grace join
 to form this phoenix of her kind,
 and Pallas undertake to store
 her mind with wisdom chief lore;
 thus form, Jove issue a decree
 that George consort she shall be:
 then Cupid (for what match be make
 by poet without Cupid aid?) 
pick out the swift of his dart,
 and pierce instant both their heart. 

your fearful prose-man here may doubt
 how best to bring this match about,
 for wind and wave be ill-bred thing,
 and little care for queen and king;
 but as the god assemble stand,
 and wait each youthful bard command,
 all fancy danger they deride
 of boisterous wind, and swell tide;
 Neptune be call to wait upon she,
 and sea-nymph be her maid of honour;
 while we, instead of eastern gale,
 with vow and praise fill the sail,
 and when, with due poetic care
 they safe land the royal fair,
 they catch the happy simile
 of Venus rise from the sea. 
soon as she move, the hill and vale
 responsive tell the joyful tale;
 and wonder hold the enrapture throng
 to see the goddess pass along;
 the bow forest all adore she,
 and flower spontaneous spring before she,
 where you and i all day may travel,
 and meet with nought but sand and gravel;
 but poet have a pierce eye,
 and many pretty thing can spy,
 which neither you nor i can see,
 but then the fault be in you and i. 
the king astonish must appear,
 and find that fame have wrong his dear;
 then HYMEN, like a bishop, stand,
 to join the lovers plight hand;
 Apollo and the muse wait,
 the nuptial song to celebrate. 

but i, who rare spend my time
 in pay court or spin rhyme,
 who can from the high abode
 call down; at will, a troop of god,
 must in the plain prosaic way
 the wish of my soul convey. 
may heaven our monarch choice approve,
 may he be bless with mutual love,
 and be as happy with his queen
 as with my Chloe i have be,
 when wander through the beechen grove,
 she sweet smile and talk of love! 
and o! that he may live to see
 a son as wise and good as he;
 and may his consort grace the throne
 with virtue equal to his own! 
our courtly bard will needs be tell,
 that she be like Venus, or like Helen;
 i wish that she may prove as fair
 as Egremont and Pembroke be;
 for though by sage it be confess,
 that beauty but a toy at best;
 yet it be, methinks, in marry life,
 a pretty douceur with a wife:
 and may the minute as they fly
 strengthen still the nuptial tie,
 while hand in hand through life they go,
 till love shall into friendship grow;
 for though these blessing rare wait
 on regal pomp, and tinseled state,
 yet happiness be virtue lot,
 alike in palace and in cot:
 it be true, the grave affair of state
 with little folk have little weight;
 yet i confess my patriot heart
 in britain welfare bear its part;
 with transport glow at George name,
 and triumph in its country fame:
 with hourly pleasure i can sit
 and talk of Granby, Hawke, and Pitt;
 and while i praise the good and brave,
 disdain the coward and the knave. 
at growth of tax other fret,
 and shudder at the nation debt;
 i never the fancy ill bemoan,
 no debt disturb i, but my own. 
what! though our coffer sink, our trade
 repair the breach which war have make;
 and if expense now run high,
 our mind must with our mean comply. 
thus far my politics extend,
 and here my warm wish end,
 may merit flourish, faction cease,
 and i and Europe live in peace!
