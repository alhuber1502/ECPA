sonnet.

by the same.

of adverse fortune gentle Shenstone 'plain,
 the liberal soul, the taste that nature give;
 in narrow bound her partial hand restrain,
 but pour profusion on the title slave:

like his my lot, alike by i disdain
 the pomp of court, one only boon i crave,
 over my field fair as those elysian feign,
 to bid the green walk wind, the green wood wave;

on the high hill to raise the high tower,
 to open wide prospect over distant plain,
 where by broad river, town, and villa rise;
 taste prompt the wish, but fortune bound the power,
 yet while health cheer, and competence sustain,
 these more than all contentment bid i prize.
