a song.

address to miss Câ€”AM of Bristol.

as spring, now approach with all his gay train,
 and scatter his beauty around the green plain,
 come then, my dear charmer, all scruple remove,
 accept of my passion, allow i to love. 

without the soft transport which love must inspire,
 without the sweet torment of fear and desire,
 our thought and idea, be never refine,
 and nothing but winter can reign in the mind. 

but love be the blossom, the spring of the soul,
 the frost of our judgment may check, not controul,
 in spite of each hindrance, the spring will return,
 and nature with transport refine will burn. 

this passion celestial, by heaven be design,
 the only fix mean of improve the mind,
 when it beam on the sense, they quick display,
 how great and prolific, how please the ray. 

then come, my dear charmer, since love be a flame,
 which polish nature, and angel your frame,
 permit the soft passion to rise in your breast,
 i leave your good nature to grant i the rest. 

shall the beautiful floweret all blossom around,
 shall Flora gay mantle, enamel the ground,
 shall the red blush blossom be see on the tree,
 without the least pleasure or rapture for i? 

and yet, if my charmer shall frown when i sing,
 ah! what be the beauty, the glory of spring! 
the flower will be fade, all happiness fly,
 and cloud veil the azure of every bright sky.
