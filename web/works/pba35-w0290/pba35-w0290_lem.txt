Jupiter and fortune.

a fable.

once Jupiter, from out the sky,
 behold a thousand temple rise;
 the goddess fortune all invoke,
 to Jove a altar seldom smoke:
 the god resolve to make inspection,
 what have occasion this defection;
 and bid the goddess tell the art,
 by which she win delude heart. 

my art! (say she) great Jove, you know,
 that i do every thing below:
 i make my votary dine on plate;
 i give the gild coach of state;
 bestow the glitter gem, that deck
 the fair lavinia lovely neck;
 i make Novella nature boast,
 and raise Valeria to a toast;
 it be i, who give the stupid, taste,
 (or make the poet lie, at least);
 my favourite son, whenever they please,
 can palace in desert raise,
 cut out canal, make fountain play,
 and make the dreary waste look gay;
 even vice seem virtue by my smile;
 i gild the villain gloomy wile,
 nay, almost raise he to a god,
 while crowd levee wait his nod. 

enough â€” the thunderer reply;
 but say, who have you satisfy? 
these boast gift be thy, i own;
 but know, content be i alone.
