TO MISS BRAND.

MARY! our Prayer being still the same,
 A little Litany I frame. 
The Wish, that dwells within each breast,
 So early form'd, so oft express'd,
 Is, by the Muse's favouring care,
 At length reduc'd to Form of Prayer. 
Sisters, who're Friends, like you and me,
 Perhaps will join our Litany;
 Whilst those, whose hearts know no such love,
 Will from our Mode, Dissenters prove.
