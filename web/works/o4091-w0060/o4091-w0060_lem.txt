MARY! our prayer be still the same,
 a little litany i frame. 
the wish, that dwell within each breast,
 so early form, so oft express,
 be, by the muse favour care,
 at length reduce to form of prayer. 
sister, who be friend, like you and i,
 perhaps will join our litany;
 while those, who heart know no such love,
 will from our mode, dissenter prove.
