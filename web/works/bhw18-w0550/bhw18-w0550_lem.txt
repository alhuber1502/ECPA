a hymn.

while thou i seek, protect power! 
be my vain wish still;
 and may this consecrate hour
 with better hope be fill. 

thy love the power of thought bestow,
 to thou my thought will soar,
 thy mercy over my life have flow —
 that mercy i adore. 

in each event of life, how clear
 thy rule hand i see;
 each blessing to my soul more dear
 because confer by thou. 

in every joy that crown my day,
 in every pain i bear,
 my heart shall find delight in praise,
 or seek relief in prayer. 

when gladness wing my favour hour,
 thy love my thought shall fill;
 resign, when storm of sorrow lower,
 my soul shall meet thy will. 

my lift eye without a tear
 the lower storm shall see;
 my steadfast heart shall know no fear —
 that heart will rest on thou!
