a fragment.

by the same.

when recent in the womb i lay,
ere yet my life begin,
thy care preserve the sleep clay,
and form it into man.

oh! may this frame, that rise grow
beneath thy plastic hand,
be studious ever to pursue
whatever thy will command.

the soul that move this earthly load
thy semblance let it bear;
nor lose the trace of the god,
who stamp his image there.
