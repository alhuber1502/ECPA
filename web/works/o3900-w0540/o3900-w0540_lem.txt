divine love.

from the german. 

i 

thou hide love of god, who height,
 who depth unfathomed no man know,
 i see from far thy beauteous light,
 inly i sigh for thy repose. 
my heart be pain, not can it be
 at rest, till it find rest in thou. 

ii.

thy secret voice invite i still
 the sweetness of thy yoke to prove;
 and fain i will: but though my will
 be fix, yet wide my passion rove. 
yet hindrance strew all the way;
 i aim at thou, yet from thou stray. 

iii.

it be mercy all, that thou have bring
 my mind to seek her peace in thou! 
yet while i seek, but find thou not,
 no peace my wander soul shall see. 
o when shall all my wander end,
 and all my step to thee-ward tend? 

iv.

be there a thing beneath the sun,
 that strive with thou my heart to share? 
ah tear it thence, and reign alone,
 the lord of every motion there:
 then shall my heart from earth be free,
 when it have find repose in thou. 

v. 

o hide this self from i, that i
 no more, but Christ in i may live! 
my vile affection crucify,
 nor let one darling lust survive. 
in all thing nothing may i see,
 nothing desire, or seek but thou! 

vi.

o love, thy sovereign aid impart,
 to save i from low-thoughted care:
 chase this self-will through all my heart,
 through all its latent maze there. 
make i thy duteous child, that i
 ceaseless may Abba father cry. 

vii.

ah no! never will i backward turn:
 thy whole, thy alone i be! 
thrice happy he, who view with scorn
 earth toy for thou his constant flame. 
o help, that i may never move
 from the bless footstep of thy love! 

viii.

each moment draw from earth away
 my heart, that lowly wait thy call:
 speak to my inmost soul, and say
 i be thy love, thy god, thy all! 
to feel thy power, to hear thy voice,
 to taste thy love be all my choice!
