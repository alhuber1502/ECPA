a simile.

dear Thomas, do thou never pop
 thy head into a tin-man shop? 
there, Thomas, do thou never see
 (it be but by way of simile)
 a squirrel spend his little rage,
 in jump round a roll cage? 
the cage, as either side turn up,
 strike a ring of Bell a-top â€”? 

move in the orb, please with the chime,
 the foolish creature think he climb:
 but here or there, turn wood or wire,
 he never get two inch high. 

so fare it with those merry blade,
 that frisk it under pindus shade. 
in noble song, and lofty ode,
 they tread on star, and talk with god;
 still dance in a airy round,
 still please with their own verse sound;
 bring back, how fast soever they go;
 always aspire, always low.
