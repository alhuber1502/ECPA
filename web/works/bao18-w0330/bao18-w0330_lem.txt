song.

yes .... though we have love so long, so well,
 imperious duty bid we part;
 but though thy breast with anguish swell,
 a pang more last tear my heart. 

my grief be dumb, .... loquacious thy,
 the mournful hoard i sacred keep;
 thou seek crowd, alone i pine;
 my eye be dry, but thy can weep. 

then, whatsoever thy lip have vow,
 a true sorrow sway my soul;
 for shallow stream run bright and loud,
 deep water dark silent roll.
