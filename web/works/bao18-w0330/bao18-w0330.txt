SONG.

YES .... though we've loved so long, so well,
 Imperious duty bids us part;
 But though thy breast with anguish swell,
 A pang more lasting tears my heart. 

My grief is dumb, .... loquacious thine,
 The mournful hoard I sacred keep;
 Thou seekest crowds, alone I pine;
 My eyes are dry, but thine can weep. 

Then, whatsoe'er thy lips have vowed,
 A truer sorrow sways my soul;
 For shallow streams run bright and loud,
 Deep waters darkly silent roll.
