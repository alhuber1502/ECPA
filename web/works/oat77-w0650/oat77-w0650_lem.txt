recover from a fit of sickness.

i 

when late the tyrannous malady
with intermit rage
seem to presage,
or sudden health or dissolution nigh;
false world (say i) that steal my real joy
shuffle in stead thy changeling toy:
begone! i will not be bribe at any rate
to sell m'approaching fate,
and reassume that toilsome task to live:
i prize not Grandieur, and i know
(be i thy favourite as i be thy foe)
what i affect, thou never can bestow:
i will have content, but that be never thy to give.
remove that taper from my sight,
the impertinent light
present no grateful object to my view;
even those fair eye that planet once appear,
(the only planet i revere)
to my dim sight, seem now to have lose their lustre too

ii.

thus muse as i lay, to my bedside
(attire in all his mourn pride)
the king of terror come;
awful his look, but not deform and grim;
he be not such bugbear as we feign of he,
scarce we our self so civilise and tame!
unknown the doom assign i in this change
for full crime and imperfect penitence,
(though just i may dread the strict revenge
of a enrage omnipotence)
yet with my present grief distress,
with curious thought of unknown world possess
inflame with thirst of liberty,
long love, but never enjoy by i,
i sue for leave the fatal gulf to pass:
my vital sand be almost run,
and death (say i) will strike anon,
then to dull life i bid along farewell;
but as the last grain fall,
death fail my credulous hope, and turn the glass.
