BIRTH-DAY

To the same, on Richmond-Green, Soon after her being Maid of Honour to Queen CAROLINE.

Bring, bring the lyre, to usher in the morn;
 Delia, the gentlest Maid, to day was born:
 And tho' she twenty summer suns has seen,
 Tho' now among the nymphs of Britain's Queen,
 Is still the gentlest Maid upon the green. 
Sure guardian Sylphs around her paths attend! 
Without a foe, and worthy ev'ry Friend. 

In one bright calm may each succeeding year
 Roll guiltless on, unruffled by a care! 
Till future Maids of Honour have approv'd
 The grove she haunted, and the stream she lov'd:
 And each bright Sister, emulous, proclaim,
 That Innocence and Pleasure are the same.
