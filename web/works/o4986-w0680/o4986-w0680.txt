TO MISS â€”, ON HER GIVING THE AUTHOR A GOLD AND SILK NETWORK PURSE OF HER OWN WEAVING.

BY THE SAME.

THOUGH gold and silk their charms unite,
 To make thy curious web delight,
 In vain the varied work would shine,
 If wrought by any hand but thine,
 Thy hand that knows the subtler art,
 To weave those nets that catch the heart. 

Spread out by me, the roving coin,
 Thy nets may catch, but not confine,
 Nor can I hope thy silken chain,
 The glittering vagrants shall restrain;
 Why, SYLVIA, was it then decreed,
 The heart once caught should ne'er be freed?
