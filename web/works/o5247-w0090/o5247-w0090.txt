To AURELIA, on her attempting to write Verses.

LONG had Aurelia vainly strove
 To write in melting Strains of Love;
 Ambitious of a Poet's Name,
 She wept, she sigh'd, she long'd for Fame;
 While of the great Design possest
 She thus the Delian God addrest:
 Brightest of heavenly Powers above,
 Immortal Son of thund'ring Jove;
 Oh glorious Deity impart
 To me the soft poetic Art;
 Vouchsafe to me thy sacred Fire,
 And with thyself my Soul inspire. 
She spake â€” the God indulgent hears
 The beauteous Maid, and grants her Prayers. 
On Clio turns his radiant Eyes,
 And to the tuneful Goddess cries,
 Fly hence to fair Aurelia's Aid,
 In heavenly Strains instruct the Maid:
 The Muse obeys the God's Commands
 With Joy, and swift as Thought descends,
 And at Aurelia's Side attends. 
Conscious of her new Power, the Maid
 With Thanks the glorious Gift repay'd:
 Now Waller's Sweetness, Granville's Fire,
 At once her tuneful Breast inspire:
 No more she vainly strives to please,
 The ready Numbers flow with ease:
 All soft, harmonious and divine;
 Apollo shines in every Line. 
The Delian God with Rapture fill'd,
 Upon his lovely Pupil smil'd. 
Daphne, his once-lov'd charming Care,
 Appear'd to him not half so fair:
 For the lost Nymph he mourns no more;
 Nor in his Songs her Loss deplore;
 But from the slighted Tree he tears
 It's Leaves, to deck Aurelia's Hairs. 
A Poet now by all she's own'd,
 And with immortal Honour crown'd.
