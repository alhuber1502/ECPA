on read pope Eloiza to Abelard.

sure, hapless fair, no heart can ever know,
 but banish lover, banish lover' woe! 
ah! Eloiza, ever exile maid,
 i read thy sorrow, sorrow as i read:
 my sympathetic heart now share thy grief,
 repeat thy sigh, and wish thy relief:
 but when i hear thou unrelenting boast
 thy taint virtue, and thy honour lose,
 all sense of pity in my bosom die,
 and direful tumult of reproach rise:
 no passion soft, or sadly-pleasing pain,
 but rage and madness in thy bosom reign;
 ah! must thy Abelard exalt be,
 above the maker of himself and thou! 
and dare thou thus explode the wed dame,
 disclaim her virtue, and disdain she same:
 blush, Eloiza, at a thought so vain,
 thy face with crimson let confusion stain;
 and while thy bosom glow with guilty fire;
 let every hope of happiness expire;
 but if again thou will my pity move,
 lament at once thy honour and thy love.
