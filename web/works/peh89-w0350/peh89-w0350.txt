On reading Pope's Eloiza to Abelard.

Sure, hapless Fair, no hearts can ever know,
 But banish'd lovers, banish'd lovers' woe! 
Ah! Eloiza, ever exil'd maid,
 I read thy sorrows, sorrowing as I read:
 My sympathetic heart now shares thy grief,
 Repeats thy sighs, and wishes thy relief:
 But when I hear thee unrelenting boast
 Thy tainted virtue, and thy honour lost,
 All sense of pity in my bosom dies,
 And direful tumults of reproaches rise:
 No passions soft, or sadly-pleasing pain,
 But rage and madness in thy bosom reign;
 Ah! must thy Abelard exalted be,
 Above the Maker of himself and thee! 
And darest thou thus explode the wedded dame,
 Disclaim her virtues, and disdain her same:
 Blush, Eloiza, at a thought so vain,
 Thy face with crimson let confusion stain;
 And while thy bosom glows with guilty fire;
 Let every hope of happiness expire;
 But if again thou would'st my pity move,
 Lament at once thy honour and thy love.
