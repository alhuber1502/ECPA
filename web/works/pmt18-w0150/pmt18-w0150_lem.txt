write at Rossana.

dear chesnut bower, i hail thy secret shade,
 image of tranquil life! escape yond throng,
 who weave the dance, and swell the choral song;
 and all the summer day have wanton play:
 i bless thy kindly gloom in silence lay:
 what though no prospect gay to thou belong;
 yet here i heed nor shower, nor sunbeam strong,
 which they, who perfume tress rose braid,
 disperse fear. their sunny bank more bright,
 and on their circle green more sweet abound,
 yet the rude blast, which rend their vestment light,
 over these dark bough with harmless music sound,
 and though no lively pleasure here be find,
 yet shall no sudden storm my calm retreat affright.
