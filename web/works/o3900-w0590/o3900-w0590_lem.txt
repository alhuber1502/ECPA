HEB. xii. 2. look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

i 

weary of struggle with my pain,
 hopeless to burst my nature chain,
 hardly i give the contest over,
 i seek to free myself no more. 

ii.

from my own work at last i cease,
 god that create must seal my peace;
 fruitless my toil and vain my care,
 and all my fitness be despair. 

iii.

lord, i despair myself to heal,
 i see my sin, but can feel:
 i can, till thy spirit blow,
 and bid the obedient water flow. 

iv.

it be thy all heart of flesh to give,
 thy gift i only can receive:
 here then to thou i all resign,
 to draw, redeem, and seal be thy. 

v. 

with simple faith, to thou i call. 
my light, my life, my lord, my all:
 i wait the move of the pool;
 i wait the word that speak i whole. 

vi.

speak gracious lord, my sickness cure,
 make my infect nature pure;
 peace, righteousness and joy impart,
 and pour thyself into my heart.
