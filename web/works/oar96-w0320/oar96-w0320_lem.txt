to Celinda.

i 

i can, Celinda, say, i love,
 but rather i adore,
 when with transport eye i view,
 your shine merit over. 

ii.

a fame so spotless and serene. 
a vertue so refine;
 and thought as great, as ever be yet
 grasp by a female mind. 

iii.

there love and honour dress, in all,
 their genuine charm appear,
 and with a please force at once
 they conquer and endear. 

iv.

celestial flame be scarce more bright,
 than those your worth inspire,
 so angel love and so they burn
 in just such holy fire. 

v. 

then let we my dear Celinda thus
 bless in our self contemn
 the treacherous and delude art,
 of those base thing call man.
