To a very Young Gentleman at a Dancing-School.

I.

SO when the Queen of Love rose from the Seas,
 Divinely Fair in such a blest amaze,
 Th' inamour'd watry Deities did gaze. 

II.

As we when charming Flammin did suprize,
 More heavenly bright our whole Seraglio's Eyes;
 And not a Nymph her Wonder could disguise. 

III.

Whilst with a graceful Pride the lovely boy
 Pass'd all the Ladies (like a Sultan) by,
 Only he lookt more absolute and coy. 

IV.

When with an Haughty air he did advance,
 To lead out some transported she to dance,
 He gave his hand as carelesly as Chance. 

V.

Attended with a Universal sigh,
 On her each Beauty cast a Jealous Eye,
 And quite fall out with guiltless Destiny.
