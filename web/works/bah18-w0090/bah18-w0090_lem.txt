[birthday ode] to the same,

age 15, at Cambridge.

now twice the spring, with flowret gay,
 have embroider over her mantle green,
 and twice the merry month of may
 with hawthorn deck the vernal scene,
 since i in tuneful number hail the morn
 when thou, my heart be dear boy, in happy hour waste bear. 

nor have i miss the annual song,
 when June return with rose crown;
 but rise sorrow check my tongue,
 and cloudy care hang lower round,
 while in the gloomy shade of threaten death
 i watch thy flutter pulse, and fear thy part breath. 

how exquisite the anxious woe,
 the agonize bitter grief,
 maternal love alone can know,
 'midst glimmer hope of slow relief;
 the cruel kindness of the heal art,
 and those dim joyless smile which rend the burst heart! 

dear be those care, to memory dear,
 which save thou from a early grave;
 and ever bless the genial year,
 the mild sky, the briny wave,
 the healthful gale, which fade life restore,
 where the smooth swell tide lave hampton happy shore. 

nor save in vain: o still pursue
 the path where truth unerring lead,
 where reason early may subdue
 the wild desire which fancy feed;
 circean charm, that with a magic force
 impel the feeble mind through youth insensate course. 

go on, dear boy, exert each power
 on time rich treasure to improve;
 and may the slow ripen hour,
 pass in the academic grove,
 strength to thy mind with ancient lore impart,
 and judgement firm to guide a warm and feel heart.
