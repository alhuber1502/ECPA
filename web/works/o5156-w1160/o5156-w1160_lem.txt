ode to spring.

by miss F. 

hail, genial goddess, bloom spring!
thy bless return, o let i sing,
and aid my languid lay:
let i not sink in sloth supine,
while all creation at thy shrine
its annual tribute pay.

ii.

escape from winter freeze power
each blossom greet thou, and each flower;
and, foremost of the train,
by nature, (artless handmaid!) dress,
the snowdrop come in lillied vest,
prophetic of thy reign.

iii.

the lark now strain his warble throat,
while every loud and sprightly note
call echo from her cell.
be warn, you fair, that listen round,
a beauteous maid become a sound,
a maid who love too well.

iv.

the bright-haired sun with warmth benign
bid tree, and shrub, and swell vine
their infant-bud display:
again the stream refresh the plain,
which winter bind in icy chain,
and sparkle bless his ray.
life-giving zephyr breathe around,
and instant glow the enamel ground
with nature vary hue:
not so return our youth decay,
alas! nor air, nor sun, nor shade
the spring of life renew.

vi.

the sun be too quick-revolving beam
will soon dissolve the human dream,
and bring the appoint hour:
too late we catch his part ray,
and mourn the idly-wasted day
no long in our power.

vii.

then happy he, who lengthen sight
pursue, by virtue constant light,
a hope beyond the sky;
where frown winter never shall come,
but rosy spring for ever bloom,
and sun eternal rise.
