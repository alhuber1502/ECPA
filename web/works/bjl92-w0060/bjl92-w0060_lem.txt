the fickle pair. 

Damon and Phillis, oth day,
 to Hymen altar hasten;
 they talk of love along the way,
 and wish the knot well fasten. 

a church the will pair perceive,
 with portal wide expand;
 the priest a speedy audience crave,
 and in the bride be hand. 

when lo! a tremor seize the fair,
 in marriage robe adorn;
 she leave the youth perplex with care,
 the rite yet unperformed. 

with eager step he swift pursue
 the object of his wish,
 and with redouble ardour woo
 she to complete his bliss. 

the maid, reluctant, turn again,
 some glance kind bestow;
 and well resolve appear the swain,
 though with resentment glow. 

kind HYMEN heave his torch, while they
 reentered both together;
 but Cupid sly take his way,
 and go – they know not whither. 

the bridegroom, next – but what of that,
 no bride his absence mourn;
 he play his charmer tit for tat;
 he go but never return. 

Philander kind fill his place;
 to Damon Chloe consent. 
that night they wed, o woeful case! 
and ere next morn repent.
