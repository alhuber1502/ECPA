to the right Hon. HENRY Pelham, ESQ;

the humble petition of the worshipful company poet and news-writer,

that your honour petitioner (dealer in rhyme;
and writer of scandal, for mend the time)
by loss in business, and England welldoing,
be sink in their credit, and verge on ruin.

that these, their misfortune, they humble conceive,
arise not from dullness, as some folk believe,
but from rub in their way, that your honour have lay,
and want of material to carry on trade.

that they always have form high conceit of their use,
and mean their last breath shall go out in abuse;
but now (and they speak it with sorrow and tear)
since your honour have sit at the helm of affair,
no party will join they, no faction invite
to heed what they say, or to read what they write;
sedition, and tumult, and discord be flee,
and slander scarce venture to lift up her head â€”
in short, public business be so carry on,
that their country be save, and the patriot undo.

to perplex they still more, and sure famine to bring
(now satire have lose both its truth and its sting)
if, in spite of their nature, they bungle at praise,
your honour regard not, and nobody pay.

your petitioner therefore most humble entreat
(as time will allow, and your honour think meet)
that measure be change, and some cause of complaint
be immediate furnish, to end their restraint;
their credit thereby, and their trade to retrieve,
that again they may rail, and the nation believe.

or else (if your wisdom shall deem it all one)
now the parliament rise, and business be do,
that your honour will please, at this dangerous crisis,
to take to your bosom a few private vice,
by which your petitioner, haply, may thrive,
and keep both themselves and contention alive.

in compassion, good sir! give they something to say,
and your honour petitioner ever shall pray.
