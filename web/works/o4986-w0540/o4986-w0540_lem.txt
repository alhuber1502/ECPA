 thy dispensation right,
 thy darling attribute be love,
 compassion thy delight.

 to pity my distress,
 offend justice will each thought
 of lenity suppress.

 for pardon leave no room;

 thy grace demand my doom.

 avenge thy injure name;
 and let a impious miscreant tear
 thy sacred wrath inflame. 

smite i, it be time, let thunder fall
 on my rebellious head;
 in my destruction i will adore
 the hand that strike i dead. 

but â€” through what region shall thy bolt
 thy missive vengeance run,
 which be not hallow by the blood
 of thy belove son?
