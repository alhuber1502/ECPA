Jupiter and the Farmer. 

WHen Poets gave their God in Crete a Birth,
 Then Jupiter held Traffick with the Earth,
 And had a Farm to Lett: the Fine was high,
 For much the Treas'ry wanted a Supply,
 By DanaÃ«'s wealthy Show'r exhausted quite, and dry. 
But Merc'ry, who as Steward kept the Court,
 So rack'd the Rent, that all who made Resort
 Unsatisfy'd return'd, nor could agree
 To use the Lands, or pay his secret Fee;
 'Till one poor Clown (thought subt'ler than the rest,
 Thro' various Projects rolling in his Breast)
 Consents to take it, if at his Desire
 All Weathers tow'rds his Harvest may conspire;
 The Frost to kill the Worm, the brooding Snow,
 The filling Rains may come, and Phoebus glow. 
The Terms accepted, sign'd and seal'd the Lease,
 His Neighbours Grounds afford their due Encrease
 The Care of Heav'n; the Owner's Cares may cease. 
Whilst the new Tenant, anxious in his Mind,
 Now asks a Show'r, now craves a rustling Wind
 To raise what That had lodg'd, that he the Sheaves may bind. 
The Sun, th'o'er-shadowing Clouds, the moistning Dews
 He with such Contrariety does chuse;
 So often and so oddly shifts the Scene,
 Whilst others Load, he scarce has what to Glean. 

O Jupiter! with Famine pinch'd he cries,
 No more will I direct th' unerring Skies;
 No more my Substance on a Project lay,
 No more a sullen Doubt I will betray,
 Let me but live to Reap, do Thou appoint the way.
