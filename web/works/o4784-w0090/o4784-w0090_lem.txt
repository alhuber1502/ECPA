Jupiter and the farmer. 

when poet give their god in Crete a birth,
 then Jupiter hold traffic with the earth,
 and have a farm to let: the fine be high,
 for much the treasury want a supply,
 by danaÃ« wealthy shower exhaust quite, and dry. 
but mercury, who as steward keep the court,
 so rack the rent, that all who make resort
 unsatisfied return, nor can agree
 to use the land, or pay his secret fee;
 until one poor clown (think subt'ler than the rest,
 through various project roll in his breast)
 consent to take it, if at his desire
 all weather towards his harvest may conspire;
 the frost to kill the worm, the brood snow,
 the fill rain may come, and Phoebus glow. 
the term accept, sign and seal the lease,
 his neighbour ground afford their due encrease
 the care of heaven; the owner care may cease. 
while the new tenant, anxious in his mind,
 now ask a shower, now crave a rustle wind
 to raise what that have lodge, that he the sheaf may bind. 
the sun, overshadowing cloud, the moisten dew
 he with such contrariety do choose;
 so often and so odd shift the scene,
 while other load, he scarce have what to glean. 

o Jupiter! with famine pinch he cry,
 no more will i direct the unerring sky;
 no more my substance on a project lie,
 no more a sullen doubt i will betray,
 let i but live to reap, do thou appoint the way.
