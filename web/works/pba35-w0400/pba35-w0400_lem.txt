write for my son, to mr. Barry; occasion by the forgo verse.

since Phoebus make your verse divine,
 since the god glow in every line;
 why shall you think, but i, with ease,
 may write my native, artless lay? 

my mother tell i many a time,
 that double-dealing be a crime:
 alas! and be it only so,
 in we, who birth and Fortune low? 
for you, though noble bear, descend
 to injure, yet appear a friend;
 and seem to make my praise your aim,
 with more success to wound my fame. 

so your apollo priest, of old,
 (as by his poet we be tell)
 with glorious wreath the victim dress;
 then plunge the poniard in his breast.
