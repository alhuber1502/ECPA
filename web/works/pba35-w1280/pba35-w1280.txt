To Robert Barber Esq; Deputy to the Treasurer's Remembrancer in the Court of Exchequer, on his attending, whilst his Son repeated Gay's Fable of the Hare and Many Friends.

Whilst Gay's unhappy Fate thy Ear attends,
 Thy Heart, indignant, scorns his faithless Friends;
 Thy gen'rous Heart, which never learnt the Way,
 A Friend or to deceive, or to betray:
 With Honour and Integrity so blest,
 Not Law, infectious, can pollute thy Breast:
 With Justice and Humanity endow'd,
 You shine, distinguish'd, 'midst a venal Croud.
