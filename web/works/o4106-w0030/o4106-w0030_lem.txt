a song.

thyrsis, a young and amorous Swain,
 see two, the beauty of the plain;
 who both his heart subdue:
 gay caelia eye be dazzle fair,
 sabina easy shape and air
 with soft magic draw. 

he haunt the stream, he haunt the grove,
 live in a fond romance of love,
 and seem for each to die;
 until each a little spiteful grow,
 Sabina caelia shape run down,
 and she sabina eye. 

their envy make the shepherd find
 those eye, which love can only blind;
 so set the lover free:
 no more he haunt the grove or stream,
 or with a true-love knot and name
 engrave a wound tree. 

ah Caelia! (sly Sabina cry)
 though neither love, we be both deny;
 now, to support the sex pride,
 let either fix the dart. 
poor girl! (say Caelia) say no more;
 for shall the Swain but one adore,
 that spite which break his chain before,
 will break the other heart.
