A SONG.

THYRSIS, a young and am'rous Swain,
 Saw two, the Beauties of the Plain;
 Who both his Heart subdue:
 Gay Caelia's Eyes were dazzling fair,
 Sabina's easy Shape and Air
 With softer Magick drew. 

He haunts the Stream, he haunts the Grove,
 Lives in a fond Romance of Love,
 And seems for each to dye;
 'Till each a little spiteful grown,
 Sabina Caelia's Shape ran down,
 And she Sabina's Eye. 

Their Envy made the Shepherd find
 Those Eyes, which Love cou'd only blind;
 So set the Lover free:
 No more he haunts the Grove or Stream,
 Or with a True-love Knot and Name
 Engraves a wounded Tree. 

Ah Caelia! (sly Sabina cry'd)
 Tho' neither love, we're both deny'd;
 Now, to support the Sex's Pride,
 Let either fix the Dart. 
Poor Girl! (says Caelia) say no more;
 For shou'd the Swain but one adore,
 That Spite which broke his Chains before,
 Wou'd break the other's Heart.
