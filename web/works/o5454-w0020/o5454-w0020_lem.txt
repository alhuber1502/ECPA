song ii.

praise for creation and providence.

i 

i sing the almighty power of god,
 that make the mountain rise,
 that spread the flow sea abroad,
 and build the lofty sky. 

ii.

i sing the wisdom that ordain
 the sun to rule the day;
 the moon shine full at his command,
 and all the star obey. 

iii.

i sing the goodness of the lord,
 that fill the earth with food;
 he form the creature with his word,
 and then pronounce they good. 

iv.

lord, how thy wonder be display,
 wherever i turn my eye! 
if i survey the ground i tread,
 or gaze upon the sky! 

v. 

there be not a plant or flower below,
 but make thy glory know;
 and cloud arise and tempest blow,
 by order from thy throne. 

vi.

creature (as numerous as they be)
 be subject to thy care;
 there be not a place where we can flee,
 but god be present there. 

vii.

in heaven he shine with beam of love,
 with wrath in hell beneath! 
it be on his earth i stand or move,
 and it be his air i breathe. 

viii.

his hand be my perpetual guard;
 he keep i with his eye:
 why shall i then forget the lord,
 who be for ever nigh?
