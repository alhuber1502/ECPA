SONG II.

Praise for Creation and Providence.

I.

I Sing th' Almighty Pow'r of GOD,
 That made the Mountains rise,
 That spread the flowing Seas abroad,
 And built the lofty Skies. 

II.

I sing the Wisdom that ordain'd
 The Sun to rule the Day;
 The Moon shines full at his Command,
 And all the Stars obey. 

III.

I sing the Goodness of the LORD,
 That fill'd the Earth with Food;
 He form'd the Creatures with his Word,
 And then pronounc'd them Good. 

IV.

LORD, how thy Wonders are display'd,
 Where'er I turn mine Eye! 
If I survey the Ground I tread,
 Or gaze upon the Sky! 

V.

There's not a Plant or Flow'r below,
 But makes thy Glories known;
 And Clouds arise and Tempests blow,
 By Order from thy Throne. 

VI.

Creatures (as num'rous as they be)
 Are subject to thy Care;
 There's not a Place where we can flee,
 But GOD is present there. 

VII.

In Heav'n he shines with Beams of Love,
 With Wrath in Hell beneath! 
'Tis on his Earth I stand or move,
 And 'tis his Air I breathe. 

VIII.

His Hand is my perpetual Guard;
 He keeps me with his Eye:
 Why should I then forget the LORD,
 Who is for ever nigh?
