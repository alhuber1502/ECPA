to miss h—l—d.

1768. 

since short the busy scene of life will prove,
 let we my h—l—d learn to live and love;
 to love, with passion pure as morning light,
 who saffron beam unsullied by the night
 with rosy mantle do the heaven streak,
 faint imitator of my h—l—d's cheek. 
the joy of nature in her ruin state
 have little pleasure, though the pain be great. 
virtue and love, when sacred band unite,
 it be then that nature lead to true delight. 
oft as i wander through the myrtle grove,
 bear the beauteous burden of my love,
 a secret terror, lest i shall offend
 the charm maid on who my joy depend,
 inform my soul, that virtuous mind alone
 can give a pleasure, to the vile unknown. 
but when the body charm, and the mind,
 to every virtuous christian act incline,
 meet in one person, maid and angel join;
 who must it be, but h—l—d the divine? 
what worth intrinsic will that man possess,
 who the dear charmer condescend to bless? 
swift will the minute roll, the fly hour,
 and blessing overtake the pair by shower. 
each moment will improve upon the past,
 and every day be better than the last. 
love, mean a unadulterated flame,
 though lust too oft usurp the sacred name;
 such passion as in H—l—d's breast can move,
 it be that alone deserve the name of love. 
oh be my merit great enough to find
 a favour station in my h—l—d's mind;
 then will my happiness be quite complete,
 and all revolve joy as in a centre meet.
