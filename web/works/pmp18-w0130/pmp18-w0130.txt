HYMN to the SUN. Set by Dr. PURCEL, And Sung before their Majesties On New-Years-Day, 1694.

I.

Light of the World, and Ruler of the Year,
 With happy Speed begin Thy great Career;
 And, as Thou dost thy radiant Journeys run,
 Through every distant Climate own,
 That in fair Albion Thou hast seen
 The greatest Prince, the brightest Queen,
 That ever sav'd a Land, or blest a Throne,
 Since first Thy Beams were spread, or Genial Power was known. 

II.

So may Thy Godhead be confest;
 So the returning Year be blest;
 As His Infant Months bestow
 Springing Wreaths for William's Brow;
 As His Summer's Youth shall shed
 Eternal Sweets around Maria's Head. 
From the Blessings They bestow,
 Our Times are dated, and our Ã†ra's move:
 They govern, and enlighten all Below,
 As Thou dost all Above. 

III.

Let our Hero in the War
 Active and fierce, like Thee, appear:
 Like Thee, great Son of Jove, like Thee,
 When clad in rising Majesty,
 Thou marchest down o'er Delos' Hills confest,
 With all Thy Arrows arm'd, in all Thy Glory drest. 
Like Thee, the Hero does his Arms imploy,
 The raging Python to destroy,
 And give the injur'd Nations Peace and Joy. 

IV.

From fairest Years, and Time's more happy Stores,
 Gather all the smiling Hours;
 Such as with friendly Care have guarded
 Patriots and Kings in rightful Wars;
 Such as with Conquest have rewarded
 Triumphant Victors happy Cares;
 Such as Story has recorded
 Sacred to Nassau's long Renown,
 For Countries sav'd, and Battels won. 

V.

March Them again in fair Array,
 And bid Them form the happy Day,
 The happy Day design'd to wait
 On William's Fame, and Europe's Fate. 
Let the happy Day be crown'd
 With great Event, and fair Success;
 No brighter in the Year be found,
 But That which brings the Victor home in Peace. 

VI.

Again Thy Godhead We implore,
 Great in Wisdom as in Power;
 Again, for good Maria's Sake, and Our's,
 Chuse out other smiling Hours,
 Such as with Joyous Wings have fled,
 When happy Counsels were advising;
 Such as have lucky Omens shed
 O'er forming Laws, and Empires rising;
 Such as many Courses ran,
 Hand in Hand, a goodly Train,
 To bless the great Eliza's Reign;
 And in the Typic Glory show,
 What fuller Bliss Maria shall bestow. 

VII.

As the solemn Hours advance,
 Mingled send into the Dance
 Many fraught with all the Treasures,
 Which Thy Eastern Travels views;
 Many wing'd with all the Pleasures,
 Man can ask, or Heav'n diffuse:
 That great Maria all those Joys may know,
 Which, from Her Cares, upon Her Subjects flow. 

VIII.

For Thy own Glory sing our Soveraign's Praise,
 God of Verses and of Days:
 Let all Thy tuneful Sons adorn
 Their lasting Work with William's Name:
 Let chosen Muses yet unborn
 Take great Maria for their future Theme:
 Eternal Structures let Them raise,
 On William's and Maria's Praise:
 Nor want new Subject for the Song;
 Nor fear they can exhaust the Store;
 'Till Nature's Musick lyes unstrung;
 'Till Thou, great God, shalt lose Thy double Pow'r;
 And touch Thy Lyre, and shoot Thy Beams no more.
