light of the world, and ruler of the year,
 with happy speed begin thy great career;
 and, as thou do thy radiant journey run,
 through every distant climate own,
 that in fair Albion thou have see
 the great prince, the bright queen,
 that ever save a land, or bless a throne,
 since first thy beam be spread, or genial power be know. 

ii.

so may thy godhead be confess;
 so the return year be bless;
 as his infant month bestow
 spring wreath for William brow;
 as his summer youth shall shed
 eternal sweet around Maria head. 
from the blessing they bestow,
 our time be date, and our Ã¦ra move:
 they govern, and enlighten all below,
 as thou do all above. 

iii.

let our hero in the war
 active and fierce, like thou, appear:
 like thou, great son of Jove, like thou,
 when clad in rise majesty,
 thou march down over delos hill confess,
 with all thy arrow arm, in all thy glory dress. 
like thou, the hero do his arm employ,
 the rage Python to destroy,
 and give the injure nation peace and joy. 

iv.

from fair year, and time be more happy store,
 gather all the smile hour;
 such as with friendly care have guard
 patriot and king in rightful war;
 such as with conquest have reward
 triumphant victor happy care;
 such as story have record
 sacred to nassau long renown,
 for country save, and Battels win. 

v. 

march they again in fair array,
 and bid they form the happy day,
 the happy day design to wait
 on William fame, and europe fate. 
let the happy day be crown
 with great event, and fair success;
 no bright in the year be find,
 but that which bring the victor home in peace. 

vi.

again thy godhead we implore,
 great in wisdom as in power;
 again, for good Maria sake, and we,
 choose out other smile hour,
 such as with joyous wing have flee,
 when happy counsel be advise;
 such as have lucky omen shed
 over form law, and empire rise;
 such as many course run,
 hand in hand, a goodly train,
 to bless the great Eliza reign;
 and in the typic glory show,
 what full bliss Maria shall bestow. 

vii.

as the solemn hour advance,
 mingle send into the dance
 many fraught with all the treasure,
 which thy eastern travel view;
 many winge with all the pleasure,
 man can ask, or heaven diffuse:
 that great Maria all those joy may know,
 which, from her care, upon her subject flow. 

viii.

for thy own glory sing our sovereign praise,
 god of verse and of day:
 let all thy tuneful son adorn
 their last work with William name:
 let choose muse yet unborn
 take great Maria for their future theme:
 eternal structure let they raise,
 on William and Maria praise:
 nor want new subject for the song;
 nor fear they can exhaust the store;
 until nature music lie unstring;
 until thou, great god, shall lose thy double power;
 and touch thy lyre, and shoot thy beam no more.
