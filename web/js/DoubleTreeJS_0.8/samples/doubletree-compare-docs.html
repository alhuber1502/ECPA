	  <h1>DoubleTreeJS document comparison demo, &copy; 2012-2016 <a href="http://linguistics.chrisculy.net" target="_blank">Chris Culy</a> </h1>
	  <p>The preloaded text is from <em>Robin Hood</em> by Howard Pyle (left) and Paul Creswick (right).
	  In browsers other than Safari, you can load all of Robin Hood (included in the download) or any plain text file,
	  but the part of speech filtering will work only if it immediately follows the word, separated by /.
	  Alt-click on a node to make it the center of its tree. Shift-click on a node to center that word in the other tree.
	  Move a tree by dragging on a node or the branches.
	  The input boxes accept regular expressions.
	  
	  Experiment! Feedback appreciated.
