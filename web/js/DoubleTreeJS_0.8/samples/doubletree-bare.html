THE
MERRY
ADVENTURES
OF
ROBIN
HOOD
by
Howard
Pyle
PREFACE
FROM
THE
AUTHOR
TO
THE
READER
You
who
so
plod
amid
serious
things
that	
you
feel
it
shame
to
give
yourself
up
even
for
a
few
short
moments
to
mirth
and
joyousness
in
the
land
of
Fancy
;
you
who
think
that	
life
hath
nought
to
do
with
innocent
laughter
that
can
harm
no
one
;
these
pages
are
not
for
you
.
Clap
to
the
leaves
and
go
no
farther
than
this
,
for
I
tell
you
plainly
that	
if
you
go
farther
you
will
be
scandalized
by
seeing
good
,
sober
folks
of
real
history
so
frisk
and
caper
in
gay
colors
and
motley
that	
you
would
not
know
them
but
for
the
names
tagged
to
them
.
Here
is
a
stout
,
lusty
fellow
with
a
quick
temper
,
yet
none
so
ill
for
all
that
,
who
goes
by
the
name
of
Henry
II
.
Here
is
a
fair
,
gentle
lady
before
whom
all
the
others
bow
and
call
her
Queen
Eleanor
.
Here
is
a
fat
rogue
of
a
fellow
,
dressed
up
in
rich
robes
of
a
clerical
kind
,
that	
all
the
good
folk
call
my
Lord
Bishop
of
Hereford
.
Here
is
a
certain
fellow
with
a
sour
temper
and
a
grim
look
--
the
worshipful
,
the
Sheriff
of
Nottingham
.
And
here
,
above
all
,
is
a
great
,
tall
,
merry
fellow
that
roams
the
greenwood
and
joins
in
homely
sports
,
and
sits
beside
the
Sheriff
at
merry
feast
,
which
same
beareth
the
name
of
the
proudest
of
the
Plantagenets
--
Richard
of
the
Lion
's
Heart
.
Beside
these
are
a
whole
host
of
knights
,
priests
,
nobles
,
burghers
,
yeomen
,
pages
,
ladies
,
lasses
,
landlords
,
beggars
,
peddlers
,
and
what
not
,
all
living
the
merriest
of
merry
lives
,
and
all
bound
by
nothing
but
a
few
odd
strands
of
certain
old
ballads
(
snipped
and
clipped
and
tied
together
again
in
a
score
of
knots
)
which
draw
these
jocund
fellows
here
and
there
,
singing
as
they
go
.
Here
you
will
find
a
hundred
dull
,
sober
,
jogging
places
,
all
tricked
out
with
flowers
and
what
not
,
till
no
one
would
know
them
in
their
fanciful
dress
.
And
here
is
a
country
bearing
a
well-known
name
,
wherein
no
chill
mists
press
upon
our
spirits
,
and
no
rain
falls
but
what
rolls
off
our
backs
like
April
showers
off
the
backs
of
sleek
drakes
;
where
flowers
bloom
forever
and
birds
are
always
singing
;
where
every
fellow
hath
a
merry
catch
as
he
travels
the
roads
,
and
ale
and
beer
and
wine
(
such
as
muddle
no
wits
)
flow
like
water
in
a
brook
.
This
country
is
not
Fairyland
.
What
is
it
?
'Tis
the
land
of
Fancy
,
and
is
of
that
pleasant
kind
that	
,
when
you
tire
of
it
--
whisk
!
--
you
clap
the
leaves
of
this
book
together
and
'tis
gone
,
and
you
are
ready
for
everyday
life
,
with
no
harm
done
.
And
now
I
lift
the
curtain
that
hangs
between
here
and
No-man's-land
.
Will
you
come
with
me
,
sweet
Reader
?
I
thank
you
.
Give
me
your
hand
.

Foresters

Also

his

gathered
around

of
the
merry

that

good
right

How
Robin
Hood
Came
to
Be
an
Outlaw
IN
MERRY
ENGLAND
in
the
time
of
old
,
when
good
King
Henry
the
Second
ruled
the
land
,
there
lived
within
the
green
glades
of
Sherwood
Forest
,
near
Nottingham
Town
,
a
famous
outlaw
whose
name
was
Robin
Hood
.
No
archer
ever
lived
that
could
speed
a
gray
goose
shaft
with
such
skill
and
cunning
as
his
,
nor
were
there
ever
such
yeomen
as
the
sevenscore
merry
men
that
roamed
with
him
through
the
greenwood
shades
.
Right
merrily
they
dwelled
within
the
depths
of
Sherwood
Forest
,
suffering
neither
care
nor
want
,
but
passing
the
time
in
merry
games
of
archery
or
bouts
of
cudgel
play
,
living
upon
the
King
's
venison
,
washed
down
with
draughts
of
ale
of
October
brewing
.
Not
only
Robin
himself
but
all
the
band
were
outlaws
and
dwelled
apart
from
other
men
,
yet
they
were
beloved
by
the
country
people
round
about
,
for
no
one
ever
came
to
jolly
Robin
for
help
in
time
of
need
and
went
away
again
with
an
empty
fist
.
And
now
I
will
tell
how
it
came
about
that	
Robin
Hood
fell
afoul
of
the
law
.
When
Robin
was
a
youth
of
eighteen
,
stout
of
sinew
and
bold
of
heart
,
the
Sheriff
of
Nottingham
proclaimed
a
shooting
match
and
offered
a
prize
of
a
butt
of
ale
to
whosoever
should
shoot
the
best
shaft
in
Nottinghamshire
.
"
Now
,
"
quoth
Robin
,
"
will
I
go
too
,
for
fain
would
I
draw
a
string
for
the
bright
eyes
of
my
lass
and
a
butt
of
good
October
brewing
.
"
So
up
he
got
and
took
his
good
stout
yew
bow
and
a
score
or
more
of
broad
clothyard
arrows
,
and
started
off
from
Locksley
Town
through
Sherwood
Forest
to
Nottingham
.
It
was
at
the
dawn
of
day
in
the
merry
Maytime
,
when
hedgerows
are
green
and
flowers
bedeck
the
meadows
;
daisies
pied
and
yellow
cuckoo
buds
and
fair
primroses
all
along
the
briery
hedges
;
when
apple
buds
blossom
and
sweet
birds
sing
,
the
lark
at
dawn
of
day
,
the
throstle
cock
and
cuckoo
;
when
lads
and
lasses
look
upon
each
other
with
sweet
thoughts
;
when
busy
housewives
spread
their
linen
to
bleach
upon
the
bright
green
grass
.
Sweet
was
the
greenwood
as
he
walked
along
its
paths
,
and
bright
the
green
and
rustling
leaves
,
amid
which
the
little
birds
sang
with
might
and
main
:
and
blithely
Robin
whistled
as
he
trudged
along
,
thinking
of
Maid
Marian
and
her
bright
eyes
,
for
at
such
times
a
youth
's
thoughts
are
wont
to
turn
pleasantly
upon
the
lass
that	
he
loves
the
best
.
As
thus
he
walked
along
with
a
brisk
step
and
a
merry
whistle
,
he
came
suddenly
upon
some
foresters
seated
beneath
a
great
oak
tree
.
Fifteen
there
were
in
all
,
making
themselves
merry
with
feasting
and
drinking
as
they
sat
around
a
huge
pasty
,
to
which
each
man
helped
himself
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
the
pie
,
and
washing
down
that	
which
they
ate
with
great
horns
of
ale
which
they
drew
all
foaming
from
a
barrel
that
stood
nigh
.
Each
man
was
clad
in
Lincoln
green
,
and
a
fine
show
they
made
,
seated
upon
the
sward
beneath
that
fair
,
spreading
tree
.
Then
one
of
them
,
with
his
mouth
full
,
called
out
to
Robin
,
"
Hulloa
,
where
goest
thou
,
little
lad
,
with
thy
one-penny
bow
and
thy
farthing
shafts
?
"
Then
Robin
grew
angry
,
for
no
stripling
likes
to
be
taunted
with
his
green
years
.
"
Now
,
"
quoth
he
,
"
my
bow
and
eke
mine
arrows
are
as
good
as
shine
;
and
moreover
,
I
go
to
the
shooting
match
at
Nottingham
Town
,
which
same
has
been
proclaimed
by
our
good
Sheriff
of
Nottinghamshire
;
there
I
will
shoot
with
other
stout
yeomen
,
for
a
prize
has
been
offered
of
a
fine
butt
of
ale
.
"
Then
one
who
held
a
horn
of
ale
in
his
hand
said
,
"
Ho
!
listen
to
the
lad
!
Why
,
boy
,
thy
mother
's
milk
is
yet
scarce
dry
upon
thy
lips
,
and
yet
thou
pratest
of
standing
up
with
good
stout
men
at
Nottingham
butts
,
thou
who
art
scarce
able
to
draw
one
string
of
a
two-stone
bow
.
"
"
I
'll
hold
the
best
of
you
twenty
marks
,
"
quoth
bold
Robin
,
"
that
I
hit
the
clout
at
threescore
rods
,
by
the
good
help
of
Our
Lady
fair
.
"
At
this
all
laughed
aloud
,
and
one
said
,
"
Well
boasted
,
thou
fair
infant
,
well
boasted
!
And
well
thou
knowest
that	
no
target
is
nigh
to
make
good
thy
wager
.
"
And
another
cried
,
"
He
will
be
taking
ale
with
his
milk
next
.
"
At
this
Robin
grew
right
mad
.
"
Hark
ye
,
"
said
he
,
"
yonder
,
at
the
glade
's
end
,
I
see
a
herd
of
deer
,
even
more
than
threescore
rods
distant
.
I
'll
hold
you
twenty
marks
that
,
by
leave
of
Our
Lady
,
I
cause
the
best
hart
among
them
to
die
.
"
"
Now
done
!
"
cried
he
who
had
spoken
first
.
"
And
here
are
twenty
marks
.
I
wager
that	
thou
causest
no
beast
to
die
,
with
or
without
the
aid
of
Our
Lady
.
"
Then
Robin
took
his
good
yew
bow
in
his
hand
,
and
placing
the
tip
at
his
instep
,
he
strung
it
right
deftly
;
then
he
nocked
a
broad
clothyard
arrow
and
,
raising
the
bow
,
drew
the
gray
goose
feather
to
his
ear
;
the
next
moment
the
bowstring
rang
and
the
arrow
sped
down
the
glade
as
a
sparrowhawk
skims
in
a
northern
wind
.
High
leaped
the
noblest
hart
of
all
the
herd
,
only
to
fall
dead
,
reddening
the
green
path
with
his
heart
's
blood
.
"
Ha
!
"
cried
Robin
,
"
how
likest
thou
that
shot
,
good
fellow
?
I
wot
the
wager
were
mine
,
an
it
were
three
hundred
pounds
.
"
Then
all
the
foresters
were
filled
with
rage
,
and
he
who
had
spoken
the
first
and
had
lost
the
wager
was
more
angry
than
all
.
"
Nay
,
"
cried
he
,
"
the
wager
is
none
of
thine
,
and
get
thee
gone
,
straightway
,
or
,
by
all
the
saints
of
heaven
,
I
'll
baste
thy
sides
until
thou
wilt
ne'er
be
able
to
walk
again
.
"
"
Knowest
thou
not
,
"
said
another
,
"
that
thou
hast
killed
the
King
's
deer
,
and
,
by
the
laws
of
our
gracious
lord
and
sovereign
King
Harry
,
thine
ears
should
be
shaven
close
to
thy
head
?
"
"
Catch
him
!
"
cried
a
third
.
"
Nay
,
"
said
a
fourth
,
"
let
him
e'en
go
because
of
his
tender
years
.
"
Never
a
word
said
Robin
Hood
,
but
he
looked
at
the
foresters
with
a
grim
face
;
then
,
turning
on
his
heel
,
strode
away
from
them
down
the
forest
glade
.
But
his
heart
was
bitterly
angry
,
for
his
blood
was
hot
and
youthful
and
prone
to
boil
.
Now
,
well
would
it
have
been
for
him
who
had
first
spoken
had
he
left
Robin
Hood
alone
;
but
his
anger
was
hot
,
both
because
the
youth
had
gotten
the
better
of
him
and
because
of
the
deep
draughts
of
ale
that	
he
had
been
quaffing
.
So
,
of
a
sudden
,
without
any
warning
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
seized
upon
his
bow
and
fitted
it
to
a
shaft
.
"
Ay
,
"
cried
he
,
"
and
I
'll
hurry
thee
anon
.
"
And
he
sent
the
arrow
whistling
after
Robin
.
It
was
well
for
Robin
Hood
that	
that
same
forester
's
head
was
spinning
with
ale
,
or
else
he
would
never
have
taken
another
step
.
As
it
was
,
the
arrow
whistled
within
three
inches
of
his
head
.
Then
he
turned
around
and
quickly
drew
his
own
bow
,
and
sent
an
arrow
back
in
return
.
"
Ye
said
I
was
no
archer
,
"
cried
he
aloud
,
"
but
say
so
now
again
!
"
The
shaft
flew
straight
;
the
archer
fell
forward
with
a
cry
,
and
lay
on
his
face
upon
the
ground
,
his
arrows
rattling
about
him
from
out
of
his
quiver
,
the
gray
goose
shaft
wet
with
his
;
heart
's
blood
.
Then
,
before
the
others
could
gather
their
wits
about
them
,
Robin
Hood
was
gone
into
the
depths
of
the
greenwood
.
Some
started
after
him
,
but
not
with
much
heart
,
for
each
feared
to
suffer
the
death
of
his
fellow
;
so
presently
they
all
came
and
lifted
the
dead
man
up
and
bore
him
away
to
Nottingham
Town
.
Meanwhile
Robin
Hood
ran
through
the
greenwood
.
Gone
was
all
the
joy
and
brightness
from
everything
,
for
his
heart
was
sick
within
him
,
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
his
soul
that	
he
had
slain
a
man
.
"
Alas
!
"
cried
he
,
"
thou
hast
found
me
an
archer
that
will
make
thy
wife
to
wring
!
I
would
that
thou
hadst
ne'er
said
one
word
to
me
,
or
that	
I
had
never
passed
thy
way
,
or
e'en
that	
my
right
forefinger
had
been
stricken
off
ere
that	
this
had
happened
!
In
haste
I
smote
,
but
grieve
I
sore
at
leisure
!
"
And
then
,
even
in
his
trouble
,
he
remembered
the
old
saw
that	
"
What
is
done
is
done
;
and
the
egg
cracked
cannot
be
cured
.
"
And
so
he
came
to
dwell
in
the
greenwood
that
was
to
be
his
home
for
many
a
year
to
come
,
never
again
to
see
the
happy
days
with
the
lads
and
lasses
of
sweet
Locksley
Town
;
for
he
was
outlawed
,
not
only
because
he
had
killed
a
man
,
but
also
because
he
had
poached
upon
the
King
's
deer
,
and
two
hundred
pounds
were
set
upon
his
head
,
as
a
reward
for
whoever
would
bring
him
to
the
court
of
the
King
.
Now
the
Sheriff
of
Nottingham
swore
that	
he
himself
would
bring
this
knave
Robin
Hood
to
justice
,
and
for
two
reasons
:
first
,
because
he
wanted
the
two
hundred
pounds
,
and
next
,
because
the
forester
that	
Robin
Hood
had
killed
was
of
kin
to
him
.
But
Robin
Hood
lay
hidden
in
Sherwood
Forest
for
one
year
,
and
in
that
time
there
gathered
around
him
many
others
like
himself
,
cast
out
from
other
folk
for
this
cause
and
for
that
.
Some
had
shot
deer
in
hungry
wintertime
,
when
they
could
get
no
other
food
,
and
had
been
seen
in
the
act
by
the
foresters
,
but
had
escaped
,
thus
saving
their
ears
;
some
had
been
turned
out
of
their
inheritance
,
that	
their
farms
might
be
added
to
the
King
's
lands
in
Sherwood
Forest
;
some
had
been
despoiled
by
a
great
baron
or
a
rich
abbot
or
a
powerful
esquire
--
all
,
for
one
cause
or
another
,
had
come
to
Sherwood
to
escape
wrong
and
oppression
.
So
,
in
all
that
year
,
fivescore
or
more
good
stout
yeomen
gathered
about
Robin
Hood
,
and
chose
him
to
be
their
leader
and
chief
.
Then
they
vowed
that	
even
as
they
themselves
had
been
despoiled
they
would
despoil
their
oppressors
,
whether
baron
,
abbot
,
knight
,
or
squire
,
and
that	
from
each
they
would
take
that
which
had
been
wrung
from
the
poor
by
unjust
taxes
,
or
land
rents
,
or
in
wrongful
fines
.
But
to
the
poor
folk
they
would
give
a
helping
hand
in
need
and
trouble
,
and
would
return
to
them
that	
which
had
been
unjustly
taken
from
them
.
Besides
this
,
they
swore
never
to
harm
a
child
nor
to
wrong
a
woman
,
be
she
maid
,
wife
,
or
widow
;
so
that	
,
after
a
while
,
when
the
people
began
to
find
that	
no
harm
was
meant
to
them
,
but
that
money
or
food
came
in
time
of
want
to
many
a
poor
family
,
they
came
to
praise
Robin
and
his
merry
men
,
and
to
tell
many
tales
of
him
and
of
his
doings
in
Sherwood
Forest
,
for
they
felt
him
to
be
one
of
themselves
.
Up
rose
Robin
Hood
one
merry
morn
when
all
the
birds
were
singing
blithely
among
the
leaves
,
and
up
rose
all
his
merry
men
,
each
fellow
washing
his
head
and
hands
in
the
cold
brown
brook
that
leaped
laughing
from
stone
to
stone
.
Then
said
Robin
,
"
For
fourteen
days
have
we
seen
no
sport
,
so
now
I
will
go
abroad
to
seek
adventures
forthwith
.
But
tarry
ye
,
my
merry
men
all
,
here
in
the
greenwood
;
only
see
that	
ye
mind
well
my
call
.
Three
blasts
upon
the
bugle
horn
I
will
blow
in
my
hour
of
need
;
then
come
quickly
,
for
I
shall
want
your
aid
.
"
So
saying
,
he
strode
away
through
the
leafy
forest
glades
until
he
had
come
to
the
verge
of
Sherwood
.
There
he
wandered
for
a
long
time
,
through
highway
and
byway
,
through
dingly
dell
and
forest
skirts
.
Now
he
met
a
fair
buxom
lass
in
a
shady
lane
,
and
each
gave
the
other
a
merry
word
and
passed
their
way
;
now
he
saw
a
fair
lady
upon
an
ambling
pad
,
to
whom
he
doffed
his
cap
,
and
who
bowed
sedately
in
return
to
the
fair
youth
;
now
he
saw
a
fat
monk
on
a
pannier-laden
ass
;
now
a
gallant
knight
,
with
spear
and
shield
and
armor
that
flashed
brightly
in
the
sunlight
;
now
a
page
clad
in
crimson
;
and
now
a
stout
burgher
from
good
Nottingham
Town
,
pacing
along
with
serious
footsteps
;
all
these
sights
he
saw
,
but
adventure
found
he
none
.
At
last
he
took
a
road
by
the
forest
skirts
,
a
bypath
that
dipped
toward
a
broad
,
pebbly
stream
spanned
by
a
narrow
bridge
made
of
a
log
of
wood
.
As
he
drew
nigh
this
bridge
he
saw
a
tall
stranger
coming
from
the
other
side
.
Thereupon
Robin
quickened
his
pace
,
as
did
the
stranger
likewise
,
each
thinking
to
cross
first
.
"
Now
stand
thou
back
,
"
quoth
Robin
,
"
and
let
the
better
man
cross
first
.
"
"
Nay
,
"
answered
the
stranger
,
"
then
stand
back
shine
own
self
,
for
the
better
man
,
I
wet
,
am
I.
"
"
That
will
we
presently
see
,
"
quoth
Robin
,
"
and
meanwhile
stand
thou
where
thou
art
,
or
else
,
by
the
bright
brow
of
Saint
AElfrida
,
I
will
show
thee
right
good
Nottingham
play
with
a
clothyard
shaft
betwixt
thy
ribs
.
"
"
Now
,
"
quoth
the
stranger
,
"
I
will
tan
thy
hide
till
it
be
as
many
colors
as
a
beggar
's
cloak
,
if
thou
darest
so
much
as
touch
a
string
of
that
same
bow
that	
thou
holdest
in
thy
hands
.
"
"
Thou
pratest
like
an
ass
,
"
said
Robin
,
"
for
I
could
send
this
shaft
clean
through
thy
proud
heart
before
a
curtal
friar
could
say
grace
over
a
roast
goose
at
Michaelmastide
.
"
"
And
thou
pratest
like
a
coward
,
"
answered
the
stranger
,
"
for
thou
standest
there
with
a
good
yew
bow
to
shoot
at
my
heart
,
while
I
have
nought
in
my
hand
but
a
plain
blackthorn
staff
wherewith
to
meet
thee
.
"
"
Now
,
"
quoth
Robin
,
"
by
the
faith
of
my
heart
,
never
have
I
had
a
coward
's
name
in
all
my
life
before
.
I
will
lay
by
my
trusty
bow
and
eke
my
arrows
,
and
if
thou
darest
abide
my
coming
,
I
will
go
and
cut
a
cudgel
to
test
thy
manhood
withal
.
"
"
Ay
,
marry
,
that
will
I
abide
thy
coming
,
and
joyously
,
too
,
"
quoth
the
stranger
;
whereupon
he
leaned
sturdily
upon
his
staff
to
await
Robin
.
Then
Robin
Hood
stepped
quickly
to
the
coverside
and
cut
a
good
staff
of
ground
oak
,
straight
,
without
new
,
and
six
feet
in
length
,
and
came
back
trimming
away
the
tender
stems
from
it
,
while
the
stranger
waited
for
him
,
leaning
upon
his
staff
,
and
whistling
as
he
gazed
round
about
.
Robin
observed
him
furtively
as
he
trimmed
his
staff
,
measuring
him
from
top
to
toe
from
out
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
and
thought
that	
he
had
never
seen
a
lustier
or
a
stouter
man
.
Tall
was
Robin
,
but
taller
was
the
stranger
by
a
head
and
a
neck
,
for
he
was
seven
feet
in
height
.
Broad
was
Robin
across
the
shoulders
,
but
broader
was
the
stranger
by
twice
the
breadth
of
a
palm
,
while
he
measured
at
least
an
ell
around
the
waist
.
"
Nevertheless
,
"
said
Robin
to
himself
,
"
I
will
baste
thy
hide
right
merrily
,
my
good
fellow
"
;
then
,
aloud
,
"
Lo
,
here
is
my
good
staff
,
lusty
and
tough
.
Now
wait
my
coming
,
an
thou
darest
,
and
meet
me
an
thou
fearest
not
.
Then
we
will
fight
until
one
or
the
other
of
us
tumble
into
the
stream
by
dint
of
blows
.
"
"
Marry
,
that
meeteth
my
whole
heart
!
"
cried
the
stranger
,
twirling
his
staff
above
his
head
,
betwixt
his
fingers
and
thumb
,
until
it
whistled
again
.
Never
did
the
Knights
of
Arthur
's
Round
Table
meet
in
a
stouter
fight
than
did
these
two
.
In
a
moment
Robin
stepped
quickly
upon
the
bridge
where
the
stranger
stood
;
first
he
made
a
feint
,
and
then
delivered
a
blow
at
the
stranger
's
head
that	
,
had
it
met
its
mark
,
would
have
tumbled
him
speedily
into
the
water
.
But
the
stranger
turned
the
blow
right
deftly
and
in
return
gave
one
as
stout
,
which
Robin
also
turned
as
the
stranger
had
done
.
So
they
stood
,
each
in
his
place
,
neither
moving
a
finger's-breadth
back
,
for
one
good
hour
,
and
many
blows
were
given
and
received
by
each
in
that
time
,
till
here
and
there
were
sore
bones
and
bumps
,
yet
neither
thought
of
crying
"
Enough
,
"
nor
seemed
likely
to
fall
from
off
the
bridge
.
Now
and
then
they
stopped
to
rest
,
and
each
thought
that	
he
never
had
seen
in
all
his
life
before
such
a
hand
at
quarterstaff
.
At
last
Robin
gave
the
stranger
a
blow
upon
the
ribs
that
made
his
jacket
smoke
like
a
damp
straw
thatch
in
the
sun
.
So
shrewd
was
the
stroke
that	
the
stranger
came
within
a
hair's-breadth
of
falling
off
the
bridge
,
but
he
regained
himself
right
quickly
and
,
by
a
dexterous
blow
,
gave
Robin
a
crack
on
the
crown
that
caused
the
blood
to
flow
.
Then
Robin
grew
mad
with
anger
and
smote
with
all
his
might
at
the
other
.
But
the
stranger
warded
the
blow
and
once
again
thwacked
Robin
,
and
this
time
so
fairly
that	
he
fell
heels
over
head
into
the
water
,
as
the
queen
pin
falls
in
a
game
of
bowls
.
"
And
where
art
thou
now
,
my
good
lad
?
"
shouted
the
stranger
,
roaring
with
laughter
.
"
Oh
,
in
the
flood
and
floating
adown
with
the
tide
,
"
cried
Robin
,
nor
could
he
forbear
laughing
himself
at
his
sorry
plight
.
Then
,
gaining
his
feet
,
he
waded
to
the
bank
,
the
little
fish
speeding
hither
and
thither
,
all
frightened
at
his
splashing
.
"
Give
me
thy
hand
,
"
cried
he
,
when
he
had
reached
the
bank
.
"
I
must
needs
own
thou
art
a
brave
and
a
sturdy
soul
and
,
withal
,
a
good
stout
stroke
with
the
cudgels
.
By
this
and
by
that
,
my
head
hummeth
like
to
a
hive
of
bees
on
a
hot
June
day
.
"
Then
he
clapped
his
horn
to
his
lips
and
winded
a
blast
that
went
echoing
sweetly
down
the
forest
paths
.
"
Ay
,
marry
,
"
quoth
he
again
,
"
thou
art
a
tall
lad
,
and
eke
a
brave
one
,
for
ne'er
,
I
bow
,
is
there
a
man
betwixt
here
and
Canterbury
Town
could
do
the
like
to
me
that	
thou
hast
done
.
"
"
And
thou
,
"
quoth
the
stranger
,
laughing
,
"
takest
thy
cudgeling
like
a
brave
heart
and
a
stout
yeoman
.
"
But
now
the
distant
twigs
and
branches
rustled
with
the
coming
of
men
,
and
suddenly
a
score
or
two
of
good
stout
yeomen
,
all
clad
in
Lincoln
green
,
burst
from
out
the
covert
,
with
merry
Will
Stutely
at
their
head
.
"
Good
master
,
"
cried
Will
,
"
how
is
this
?
Truly
thou
art
all
wet
from
head
to
foot
,
and
that	
to
the
very
skin
.
"
"
Why
,
marry
,
"
answered
jolly
Robin
,
"
yon
stout
fellow
hath
tumbled
me
neck
and
crop
into
the
water
and
hath
given
me
a
drubbing
beside
.
"
"
Then
shall
he
not
go
without
a
ducking
and
eke
a
drubbing
himself
!
"
cried
Will
Stutely
.
"
Have
at
him
,
lads
!
"
Then
Will
and
a
score
of
yeomen
leaped
upon
the
stranger
,
but
though
they
sprang
quickly
they
found
him
ready
and
felt
him
strike
right
and
left
with
his
stout
staff
,
so
that	
,
though
he
went
down
with
press
of
numbers
,
some
of
them
rubbed
cracked
crowns
before
he
was
overcome
.
"
Nay
,
forbear
!
"
cried
Robin
,
laughing
until
his
sore
sides
ached
again
.
"
He
is
a
right
good
man
and
true
,
and
no
harm
shall
befall
him
.
Now
hark
ye
,
good
youth
,
wilt
thou
stay
with
me
and
be
one
of
my
band
?
Three
suits
of
Lincoln
green
shalt
thou
have
each
year
,
beside
forty
marks
in
fee
,
and
share
with
us
whatsoever
good
shall
befall
us
.
Thou
shalt
eat
sweet
venison
and
quaff
the
stoutest
ale
,
and
mine
own
good
right-hand
man
shalt
thou
be
,
for
never
did
I
see
such
a
cudgel
player
in
all
my
life
before
.
Speak
!
Wilt
thou
be
one
of
my
good
merry
men
?
"
"
That
know
I
not
,
"
quoth
the
stranger
surlily
,
for
he
was
angry
at
being
so
tumbled
about
.
"
If
ye
handle
yew
bow
and
apple
shaft
no
better
than
ye
do
oaken
cudgel
,
I
wot
ye
are
not
fit
to
be
called
yeomen
in
my
country
;
but
if
there
be
any
man
here
that	
can
shoot
a
better
shaft
than
I
,
then
will
I
bethink
me
of
joining
with
you
.
"
"
Now
by
my
faith
,
"
said
Robin
,
"
thou
art
a
right
saucy
varlet
,
sirrah
;
yet
I
will
stoop
to
thee
as
I
never
stooped
to
man
before
.
Good
Stutely
,
cut
thou
a
fair
white
piece
of
bark
four
fingers
in
breadth
,
and
set
it
fourscore
yards
distant
on
yonder
oak
.
Now
,
stranger
,
hit
that	
fairly
with
a
gray
goose
shaft
and
call
thyself
an
archer
.
"
"
Ay
,
marry
,
that
will
I
,
"
answered
he
.
"
Give
me
a
good
stout
bow
and
a
fair
broad
arrow
,
and
if
I
hit
it
not
,
strip
me
and
beat
me
blue
with
bowstrings
.
"
Then
he
chose
the
stoutest
bow
among
them
all
,
next
to
Robin
's
own
,
and
a
straight
gray
goose
shaft
,
well-feathered
and
smooth
,
and
stepping
to
the
mark
--
while
all
the
band
,
sitting
or
lying
upon
the
greensward
,
watched
to
see
him
shoot
--
he
drew
the
arrow
to
his
cheek
and
loosed
the
shaft
right
deftly
,
sending
it
so
straight
down
the
path
that	
it
clove
the
mark
in
the
very
center
.
"
Aha
!
"
cried
he
,
"
mend
thou
that	
if
thou
canst
"
;
while
even
the
yeomen
clapped
their
hands
at
so
fair
a
shot
.
"
That
is
a
keen
shot
indeed
,
"
quoth
Robin
.
"
Mend
it
I
cannot
,
but
mar
it
I
may
,
perhaps
.
"
Then
taking
up
his
own
good
stout
bow
and
nocking
an
arrow
with
care
,
he
shot
with
his
very
greatest
skill
.
Straight
flew
the
arrow
,
and
so
true
that	
it
lit
fairly
upon
the
stranger
's
shaft
and
split
it
into
splinters
.
Then
all
the
yeomen
leaped
to
their
feet
and
shouted
for
joy
that	
their
master
had
shot
so
well
.
"
Now
by
the
lusty
yew
bow
of
good
Saint
Withold
,
"
cried
the
stranger
,
"
that
is
a
shot
indeed
,
and
never
saw
I
the
like
in
all
my
life
before
!
Now
truly
will
I
be
thy
man
henceforth
and
for
aye
.
Good
Adam
Bell[1
]
was
a
fair
shot
,
but
never
shot
he
so
!
"
[
1
]
Adam
Bell
,
Clym
o
'
the
Clough
,
and
William
of
Cloudesly
were
three
noted
north-country
bowmen
whose
names
have
been
celebrated
in
many
ballads
of
the
olden
time
.
"
Then
have
I
gained
a
right
good
man
this
day
,
"
quoth
jolly
Robin
.
"
What
name
goest
thou
by
,
good
fellow
?
"
"
Men
call
me
John
Little
whence
I
came
,
"
answered
the
stranger
.
Then
Will
Stutely
,
who
loved
a
good
jest
,
spoke
up
.
"
Nay
,
fair
little
stranger
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
like
not
thy
name
and
fain
would
I
have
it
otherwise
.
Little
art
thou
indeed
,
and
small
of
bone
and
sinew
,
therefore
shalt
thou
be
christened
Little
John
,
and
I
will
be
thy
godfather
.
"
Then
Robin
Hood
and
all
his
band
laughed
aloud
until
the
stranger
began
to
grow
angry
.
"
An
thou
make
a
jest
of
me
,
"
quoth
he
to
Will
Stutely
,
"
thou
wilt
have
sore
bones
and
little
pay
,
and
that	
in
short
season
.
"
"
Nay
,
good
friend
,
"
said
Robin
Hood
,
"
bottle
thine
anger
,
for
the
name
fitteth
thee
well
.
Little
John
shall
thou
be
called
henceforth
,
and
Little
John
shall
it
be
.
So
come
,
my
merry
men
,
we
will
prepare
a
christening
feast
for
this
fair
infant
.
"
So
turning
their
backs
upon
the
stream
,
they
plunged
into
the
forest
once
more
,
through
which
they
traced
their
steps
till
they
reached
the
spot
where
they
dwelled
in
the
depths
of
the
woodland
.
There
had
they
built
huts
of
bark
and
branches
of
trees
,
and
made
couches
of
sweet
rushes
spread
over
with
skins
of
fallow
deer
.
Here
stood
a
great
oak
tree
with
branches
spreading
broadly
around
,
beneath
which
was
a
seat
of
green
moss
where
Robin
Hood
was
wont
to
sit
at
feast
and
at
merrymaking
with
his
stout
men
about
him
.
Here
they
found
the
rest
of
the
band
,
some
of
whom
had
come
in
with
a
brace
of
fat
does
.
Then
they
all
built
great
fires
and
after
a
time
roasted
the
does
and
broached
a
barrel
of
humming
ale
.
Then
when
the
feast
was
ready
they
all
sat
down
,
but
Robin
placed
Little
John
at
his
right
hand
,
for
he
was
henceforth
to
be
the
second
in
the
band
.
Then
when
the
feast
was
done
Will
Stutely
spoke
up
.
"
It
is
now
time
,
I
ween
,
to
christen
our
bonny
babe
,
is
it
not
so
,
merry
boys
?
"
And
"
Aye
!
Aye
!
"
cried
all
,
laughing
till
the
woods
echoed
with
their
mirth
.
"
Then
seven
sponsors
shall
we
have
,
"
quoth
Will
Stutely
,
and
hunting
among
all
the
band
,
he
chose
the
seven
stoutest
men
of
them
all
.
"
Now
by
Saint
Dunstan
,
"
cried
Little
John
,
springing
to
his
feet
,
"
more
than
one
of
you
shall
rue
it
an
you
lay
finger
upon
me
.
"
But
without
a
word
they
all
ran
upon
him
at
once
,
seizing
him
by
his
legs
and
arms
and
holding
him
tightly
in
spite
of
his
struggles
,
and
they
bore
him
forth
while
all
stood
around
to
see
the
sport
.
Then
one
came
forward
who
had
been
chosen
to
play
the
priest
because
he
had
a
bald
crown
,
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
brimming
pot
of
ale
.
"
Now
,
who
bringeth
this
babe
?
"
asked
he
right
soberly
.
"
That
do
I
,
"
answered
Will
Stutely
.
"
And
what
name
callest
thou
him
?
"
"
Little
John
call
I
him
.
"
"
Now
Little
John
,
"
quoth
the
mock
priest
,
"
thou
hast
not
lived
heretofore
,
but
only
got
thee
along
through
the
world
,
but
henceforth
thou
wilt
live
indeed
.
When
thou
livedst
not
thou
wast
called
John
Little
,
but
now
that
thou
dost
live
indeed
,
Little
John
shalt
thou
be
called
,
so
christen
I
thee
.
"
And
at
these
last
words
he
emptied
the
pot
of
ale
upon
Little
John
's
head
.
Then
all
shouted
with
laughter
as
they
saw
the
good
brown
ale
stream
over
Little
John
's
beard
and
trickle
from
his
nose
and
chin
,
while
his
eyes
blinked
with
the
smart
of
it
.
At
first
he
was
of
a
mind
to
be
angry
but
found
he
could
not
,
because
the
others
were
so
merry
;
so
he
,
too
,
laughed
with
the
rest
.
Then
Robin
took
this
sweet
,
pretty
babe
,
clothed
him
all
anew
from
top
to
toe
in
Lincoln
green
,
and
gave
him
a
good
stout
bow
,
and
so
made
him
a
member
of
the
merry
band
.
And
thus
it
was
that	
Robin
Hood
became
outlawed
;
thus
a
band
of
merry
companions
gathered
about
him
,
and
thus
he
gained
his
right-hand
man
,
Little
John
;
and
so
the
prologue
ends
.
And
now
I
will
tell
how
the
Sheriff
of
Nottingham
three
times
sought
to
take
Robin
Hood
,
and
how
he
failed
each
time
.
