    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      This is a guide for how to develop <em>new</em> applications using
      <a href="http://linguistics.chrisculy.net/software/DoubleTreeJS/index.html" target="_blank">DoubleTreeJS</a>.
    </p>
	 
	 <p>
		A DoubleTreeJS application consists of a variety of components, as shown in this schematic system diagram:
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
		<img id="system" src="SystemDiagram.png">
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
		The DoubleTreeJS <em>visualization</em> is just one of the components.
		The sample applications give examples of some of the possibilities for each of the other components, each of which will be
		covered in turn below.
	 </p>
	
    </section>
	 
    <section id="data">
      <h3>The data</h3>
	  <p>
	    DoubleTree (and DoubleTreeJS specifically) is meant to visualize <em>sequences of items</em>. While a typical scenario would
	    consist of consecutive tokens of from a text, other types of items are possible, both simple (e.g. POS tags), and complex
	    (e.g. word-lemma-POS-author tuples). DoubleTreeJS does not itself do any analysis of raw data &mdash; that is the responsibility
	    of the application (or the user). However, many of the sample applications <em>do</em> allow for the possibility of plain text
	    input, which is then "analyzed" into tokens by splitting on white space. However, most of the sample applications assume that
	    a text has already been analyzed, e.g. with POS tags. The dependency paths sample application does the most analysis, but it takes as
	    its input a file of dependency parses in the CONLL-X format, i.e. a file which itself is the result of significant analysis.
	    
	  </p>
    </section>
	 
    <section id="model">
       <h3>The data model</h3>
	  <p>
	    The data model is a representation of the analyzed data. It might be a transformed version of the analyzed data, e.g. eliminating
	    punctuation. Often an application will have its own particular data model, especially when DoubleTreeJS is used in conjunction
	    with another program, e.g. a corpus query engine. In the example for The Sketch Engine (only included in the download), it is
		 The Sketch Engine which provides both the data model and the query engine.		  
	  </p>
	  <h4 id="TextHash">Using TextHash as a data model</h4>
	  <p>
	    To facilitate creating applications, DoubleTreeJS comes with a basic data model:
	    <a href="doc/symbols/textmodel.TextHash.html">textmodel.TextHash</a>. TextHash provides a way to read in structured data as well
	    as simple query engine (see <a href="#queryEngine">below</a>). In addition, TextHash provides the means to filter the data,
	    removing items from consideration based on any test concerning the information in the item that the developer can write. See
	    <a href="samples/doubletree-filtered.html">doubletree-filtered</a> for an example. 
	    TextHash can give a list of unique items, used in the examples for the "predictive" selection of items.
	  </p>
	      
	  <p>
	    TextHash can read structured data, where items are separated by whitespace and "fields" in the item are separated by a delimiter.
	    For example, the sample data included with DoubleTreeJS use forward slash (/) as the delimiter, so the begining of
	    RobinHood_Pyle_tagged.txt is:
	  </p>
	    <pre>
	    THE/DT
	    MERRY/NP
	    ADVENTURES/NP
	    OF/IN
	    ROBIN/NP
	    HOOD/NP
	    </pre>
	  <p>
	    When reading structured data, TextHash must know what the fields in the elements are, as well as the delimiter, so its constructor
	    takes those as arguments. In addition, needs to know which fields are relevant for determining "sameness". For example, we might
	    decide that lemma and POS are relevant for determining "sameness", so that e.g. the verb <em>bank</em> and the noun <em>bank</em>
	    would be kept separate, but the verb <em>banks</em> would be grouped together with the verb <em>banked</em>. One other
	    field-related argument is that indicating which field is the "base", or the fundamental field for the visualization. Finally,
	    TextHash also allows for groups of items to be treated as a unit. For example, we might not want the context to cross a chapter,
	    or even a sentence. In this case, the units must be separated by one or more blank lines. This functionality is used in the
	    dependency paths example, so that path contexts are limited to a single sentence.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    A TextHash can be (manually) saved as JSON object, and then restored via
	    <a href="doc/symbols/textmodel.TextHash.html#fromJSON">fromJSON()</a>. In this way, the text does not have to be analysed when
	    the page loads, but the TextHash is read instead. See the <a href="samples/doubletree-metadata.html" target="_blank">metadata
	    sample</a> for an example of this technique.
	  </p>
    </section>
	 
    <section id="queryEngine">
      <h3>The query engine</h3>
	  
	<p>
	  We need some way to get information out of the data model so we can visualize it with DoubleTreeJS. This is where the query engine
	  comes in. The query engine can be as simple or as complex as the application requires. The sample example for The Sketch Engine
	  shows how DoubleTreeJS can used as (part of) an interface to a corpus query engine. (A similar approach could work for other
	  corpus query engines; in fact, the original DoubleTree was used as a front end to the Open Corpus Workbench.) These examples show
	  how we can combine the power of a sophisticated query language with the usability of a DoubleTree.
	  (Note that due to CORS, the SketchEngine example needs to be on a SketchEngine server,
	  or have its requests proxied to a SketchEngine server.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  TextHash (see <a href="#TextHash">above</a>) provides a simple query engine. It allows both simple and regular expression based
	  queries, using a string representation of the items to query against. It is in the query using
	  <a href="doc/symbols/textmodel.TextHash.html#getItem">getItem()</a> or
	  <a href="doc/symbols/textmodel.TextHash.html#getItems">getItems()</a>that we do the actual filtering of the data. Filters can
	  specify the inclusion or exclusion of elements based on the contents of their fields. Both query functions return results in the
	  form needed by DoubleTreeJS (<a href="#inputFormat">see below</a>).
	</p>
	   
    </section>
    
    <section id="dtjs">
      <h3>Using DoubleTreeJS</h3>
      <p>
	DoubleTreeJS consists of two pieces: the visualization itself
	(<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html">doubletree.DoubleTree</a>) and the trie data structure used by the visualization
	(<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.Trie.html">doubletree.Trie</a>). In addition, applications will also have some kind of data model
	which provides the data for DoubleTreeJS (see <a href="#model">above</a>). Most of the samples included with DoubleTreeJS use the class
	<a href="doc/symbols/textmodel.TextHash.html">TextHash</a> as the data source.
      </p>
      <p>
	doubletree.DoubleTree and doubletree.Trie use the common "chaining" pattern, so that multiple properties can be set in a row. e.g.
       </p>
	<code>
dt.init("#doubletree").visWidth(w).prefixesOnRight(false).handlers(handlers) \\
		.showTokenExtra(showTokenExtras).sortFun(sortFun).filters(filters);
	</code>
      <p>
	In addition, CSS classes are used as much as possible for styling various aspects of the DoubleTree. All the relevant classes are in
	the file doubletree.css, in the same directory as DoubleTreeJs.
      </p>

      <p id="inputFormat">
	The input data consists of three parts, analogous to a keyword in context display:
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>the "hits" (containing the element that will be at the root of the DoubleTree)</li>
	  <li>the left context (prefix) of the hits (containing the elements in the left-hand side of the DoubleTree)</li>
	  <li>the right context (suffix) of the hits (containing the elements in the right-hand side of the DoubleTree)</li>
	</ul>
	
      <p>
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.setupFromArrays">DoubleTree.setupFromArrays()</a> takes 4 arrays (and some other
	parameters, see following), corresponding to the prefixes, the hits, the suffixes, and the ids of the hits, where element <em>i</em> of the hits array has
	element <em>i</em> of the prefix array as its prefix, element <em>i</em> of the suffix array as its suffix,
	and element <em>i</em> of the ids array as its id.
	DoubleTree internally constructs a doubletree.Trie and then creates the visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
	Each element in the hits, prefixes and suffixes consists of a string with various fields, delimited by a delimiter
	(e.g. the samples use "/" as the delimiter). These fields need to be given names via the fieldNames parameter of
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.setupFromArrays">DoubleTree.setupFromArrays()</a>.
	We also need to specify whether the primary field (typically a token) is to be treated case sensitively.
	However, not all of these fields will necessarily be relevant for determining which elements are to be treated alike.
	We thus need to specify which fields <em>are</em> relevant via the distinguishingFields parameter.
	And of course, we need to specify what the delimiter is, via the fieldDelim parameter.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Not surprisingly, these are the same parameters that <a href="doc/symbols/textmodel.TextHash.html">TextHash</a> uses...
      </p>
      
      <p>
	While DoubleTree can work with these arrays of hits, prefixes and suffixes, it can also directly load doubletree.Tries that have
	been created elsewhere, via <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.setupFromTries">DoubleTree.setupFromTries()</a>,
	which takes two doubletree.Tries, one for the left side of the DoubleTree and one for the right side.
	<span class="attention">Note</span> that doubletree.Trie is a specialized trie, and  doubletree.DoubleTree.setupFromTries() will
	work <em>only</em> with instances of doubletree.Trie, not with other types of tries.
      </p>
      <p>
	Since <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.Trie.html">doubletree.Trie</a> is the basic datastructure, it needs to know all the
	information about the elements and their fields, so its constructor takes all four types of information as its parameters:
	caseSensitive, fldNames, fldDelim, distinguishingFldsArray.
	In addition, doubletree.Trie has <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.Trie.html#serialize">serialize()</a> and
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.Trie.html#deserialize">deserialize()</a> functions to help with working with doubletree.Tries
	external to DoubleTree.
      </p>
    </section>
   
    
    <section id="customizing">
      <h3>Customizing a DoubleTreeJS</h3>
      <h4 id="higlightingAndSearch">Highlighting and search</h4>
      <p>
	doubletree.DoubleTree is created with a 0 argument constructor:
      </p>
      
	<code>dt = new doubletree.DoubleTree();
	</code>
	
      <p>
	It is given the data either with <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.setupFromArrays">DoubleTree.setupFromArrays()</a>
	or <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.setupFromTries">DoubleTree.setupFromTries()</a> as discussed above.
	The basic DoubleTree provides the ability to expand and collapse nodes by clicking on them, as well as highlighting the nodes that
	correspond to prefixes and suffixes of the node just clicked. Highlighting is customizable via
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.basicStyles">DoubleTree.basicStyles()</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<span clas="attention">Note</span>: the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/canvg/" target="_blank">canvg</a> library used to create
	images from the DoubleTrees in some of the examples does not respect external CSS styles. This is why the basic styles are not set
	via CSS but rather in the javascript.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	It is also possible to search the nodes in a DoubleTree, using
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.search">DoubleTree.search()</a>, which takes a regular expression string argument.
	Nodes that match the search term are given the "foundText" CSS class. The search can be cleared using
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.clearSearch">DoubleTree.clearSearch()</a>, which removes all the "foundText" classes.
	<span class="attention">Note</span> that the user interface for searching and clearing is <em>NOT</em> part of the DoubleTreeJS
	library &mdash; you will need to create that yourself in your application.
      </p>
      
      <h4 id="infoObject">The info object</h4>
       <p>
	  Each node of a DoubleTree contains an "info" object, which is simply an object with a variety of properties.
	  These properties include all the fields of the element, as well as information about the "count" and the "continuations".
	  This info object is used by the various interaction handlers as well as in sorting and filtering.
	</p>
       
       <h4 id="nodeText">The node text</h4>
	<p>
	  You can customize what appears on each node via a function which gets the info object of the current node as its argument.
	  This node text function is set via <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.nodeText">DoubleTree.nodeText()</a>.
	  Here is example that shows the "lemma" field followed by the "count" field in parentheses:
	</p>
	  <code>
	  function(info) {
	    return info["lemma"] + " (" + info.count + ")";
	  }
	  </code>
	 
       <h4 id="tokenExtras">Token extras</h4>
	  <p>
	    In addition to the basic information for the node, you may want to be able to toggle display of "extra" information.
	    You can do this via "tokenExtras". As with the node text, the content is defined by a function which gets the info object of
	    the current node as its argument.
	    This function is set via  <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.tokenExtraText">DoubleTree.tokenExtraText()</a>.
	    Toggling of the token extras is done via
	    <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.showTokenExtra">DoubleTree.showTokenExtra()</a>.
	  </p>
	
      <h4 id="bgRects">Background rectangles</h4>
	<p>
	  It is also possible to provide a colored rectangle, with or without colored borders for each node. The colors and the presence
	  or absence of a border can all be used to encode information, as in the
	  <a href="samples/doubletree-metadata.html" target="_blank">metadata sample</a>. The colors of the rectangles and their borders
	  are determined by two functions, set via <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.rectColor">DoubleTree.rectColor()</a>
	  and <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.rectBorderColor">DoubleTree.rectBorderColor()</a>. The two functions are
	  independent, and each gets the info object of the current node as its argument, and they must return a CSS color as a string.
	  Here is an example of a border color function from the metadata sample.
	</p>
	
	<code>
	  <pre>
	//we put a gray border around lemmas that occur in all 3 sources, and no border on anything else
	var borderColor = function(info) {
	    var defaultC = "rgba(255,255,255,0)"; //transparent white
	    if (info["source"].length == 3) {
		return "rgba(64,64,64,0.5)"; //transparent gray
	    }
	    return defaultC;
	}</pre>
	</code>
       
       
       <h4 id="sorting">Sorting</h4>
       <p>
	The branches of the DoubleTree can be sorted by any function of the information in the info objects. The sort function is set via
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.sortFun">DoubleTree.sortFun()</a>, and it gets the info object of the current
	node as its argument. Here is an example of a sorting function, the built-in
	<a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.html#.sortByCount">doubletree.sortByCount()</a>: 
       </p>
       
	<code>
	doubletree.sortByCount = function() {
	  return function(a,b) {
	      return b.info.count - a.info.count;
	  }
	}
	
	</code>
	
      <p>
	<span class="attention">Note</span> that the branches are sorted in <em>ascending</em> order (according to the sortFun).
	You also need to explicitly redraw() the visualization to update the display.
      </p>
       
       <h4 id="filtering">Filtering</h4>
       <p>
       We can also limit which branches are shown, via filtering functions. <span class="attention">Note</span>: These filters are
       <em>NOT</em> the filters in TextHash, which filter the data. These filters only affect what is <em>shown</em> in the DoubleTree.
       As with sorting functions, the filtering functions also get the info object of the current node as their argument.
       The left and right sides of the DoubleTree have their own filtering functions, and each level of a side has its own filtering
       function. The filters are specified via an object with "left" and "right" keys, each of which takes an array of functions.
       Element <em>i</em> of the array filters the <em>i+1</em> position of the side.
       So filters.left[1] will filter the prefix second element(s) from the root.
       </p>
       <p>
	Filters are set via  <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.filters">DoubleTree.filters()</a>.
	<span class="attention">Note</span> that you need to explicitly redraw() the visualization to update the display.
      </p>
       </p>
       
      <h4 id="interaction">Interaction</h4>
      
      <p>In addition to the expanding/collapsing of nodes, DoubleTree also provides two hooks for additional interaction, namely for
      shift-clicking and alt-clicking
      (<span class="attention">Note</span> use AltGr+Alt-click in FireFox for Linux pre-empts alt-click for its own purposes.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
	As with the other functions, the shift-click and alt-click handlers get the info object of the current node as their argument.
	Of course, their effects are not limited to the DoubleTree &mdash; many of the examples show a KWIC on shift-click.
	The handlers are specified using <a href="doc/symbols/doubletree.DoubleTree.html#.handlers">DoubleTree.handlers()</a>, which 
	takes an object that has "shift" and "alt" keys, which take functions as their values.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<span class="attention">Note</span> that the functionality in the examples of alt-clicking to reset the root is <em>NOT</em>
	a built-in part of DoubleTreeJS, since it requires getting the new data from the external data source.
      </p>

      <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
      The sample <a href="samples/doubletree-kwic.html" target="_blank">Double Tree with KWIC</a> should give you a good idea of how to proceede.
      Here are the steps, with reference to that sample.
      <ol>
      <li>
	The first thing to do is set up the data source. Everytime the visualization gets a new root, the data source will have to be consulted.
	cf. setup(), setupDT(), resetData()
      </li>
      <li>
	Next set up any handlers for interaction (shift-click and alt-click), as well as any filter functions.
	cf. altHndlr, shiftHndlr, handlers, setupDT()
      </li>
      <li>
	Then set up the GUI elements for search, tokenExtras, and anything else (e.g. getting a new root element from the data source).
	cf. doSearch(), doClear(), updateFilters(),  togglePOS(), doPredictive(), makeKWIC()
      </li>
      <li>
	Finally, add any explanatory text, etc.
      </li>
