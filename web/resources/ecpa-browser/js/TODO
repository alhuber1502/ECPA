Per 7/28/14 email conversation:

Analyzing the model:

- topic labels
	- Susana, Lindsey, Andy, and Laura (SLAL) - Aug 1

- which are uninformative?
	- SLAL - Aug 1
	-consult with AG after early Aug Skype convo


 Text:

- editorial comments on the model?
	- Early Sept

 - other remaining writing/editing?
	- short analysis of example topics
		-SLA draft Aug 30

Software:

- topic labels
- hiding topics
- article/issue tagging (e.g.: virtual ToCs, indication of special issues...)
    [DONE]
- interface refinements, various (e.g.: how the introductory text appears/disappears, whether the site detects incompatible browsers)
    + scroll to top when click into new view
    + topic view needs less obtrusive special-issue flagging
- links or other display of editorial comments?
- more appropriate bibliography page sorting options... [DONE]
- fixing links to articles? [DONE]
- retooling dates? [DONE]

 Design:

- where and how to display editorial comments
- match Signs's style more closely? Nothing about the typography, color scheme, etc. of the browser is fixed. I think it would be good to think about distinguishing this a little from the bland default look of bootstrap (and, in fact, from the other model browser site I've made public, www.rci.rutgers.edu/~ag978/quiet).
	-Andy plus others' input
		-initial attempts ~Aug 15

 Other tasks?
- overall site design
	-AM and Susana, Lindsey and Laura
		-sample page mockups and overall structure before Aug 30
- contact Jonathan Goodwin re: republishing his cocitation graph (http://jgoodwin.net/signs/test.html)
	-Andy, 7/29


Agenda for SLAL early Aug Skype meeting

- brainstorm overall site design
- ideas for styling model browser
- finalize 10 ToCs
