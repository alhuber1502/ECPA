<h3 id="leitklaenge">Leitklänge (Alexander Huber)</h3>

<p>
  <em>Leitklänge</em> is a visualization of the patterns in the phonemic makeup of a poem. 
  It visualizes vowel and consonant groups and distributions using easy-to-read colour highlighting. 
  The visualization was inspired by Marc R. Plamondon's <em>English Poetic Phonemics</em>-project
  (2008/9) and extends it to include sound-based rhetorical devices such as alliteration, assonance,
  and consonance.
